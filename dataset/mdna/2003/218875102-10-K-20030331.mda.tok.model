item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations notes regarding forward looking statements this report on form k includes statements that reflect our belief concerning future events and financial performance 
statements which are not purely historical in nature are called forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of we sometimes identify forward looking statements with such words as may  will  should  expect  anticipate  estimate  seek  project  plan  intend  believe or similar words concerning future events 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
they are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from past results or our predictions 
factors that could contribute to differences include  but are not limited to  those risks and uncertainties identified under risk factors on pages to you should also carefully review the risk factors set forth in other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission particularly the quarterly reports on form q and any current reports on form k 
all statements included in this document are based on information available to us as of the date of this report on form k  and we assume no obligation to update any such statements  or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in forward looking statements 
overview we are a leading enterprise application service provider  or asp 
we provide to our customers application implementation  integration  management and various upgrade services and related hardware and network infrastructure 
we implement  integrate and manage a suite of enterprise software applications from leading vendors 
following the implementation of software applications by our partners or us  our customers pay a monthly service fee based largely on the number of applications used and total users 
our application management services agreements typically range in duration from two to three years and typically guarantee service levels for customers of at least availability  excluding scheduled downtime 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 

table of contents corio  inc 
form k estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  contingencies  restructuring costs and other special charges 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we review these accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
in addition  our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations cash basis revenue recognition customers allowance for doubtful accounts loss contingencies valuation allowance cash basis revenue recognition customers we recognize revenue from application management services as the services are provided to our customers provided that collection of the receivable is probable 
we regularly monitor the payment activity and credit worthiness of our customers 
if we determine that collection of revenue from a particular customer or contract is no longer probable  we revert to recognizing revenue as payment for services is received and we designate those customers as cash basis customers 
at december  and  we had outstanding invoices of million and million  respectively related to services provided to cash basis customers 
since revenue related to these invoices is recognized on a cash basis  these amounts have not been included in our accounts receivable balances 
our revenue in the future could fluctuate significantly due to the timing and amount of payments received from cash basis customers as well as the change in composition of these customers 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected 
we regularly review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts through identification of specific receivables where it is expected that payment will not be received in addition to establishing a general reserve policy that is applied to all amounts that are not specifically identified 
in determining specific receivables where collection may not be received  we review past due receivables and give consideration to prior collection history  changes in the customer s overall business condition and the potential risk associated with the customer s industry among other factors 
a general reserve is established for all amounts which have not been specifically identified  based on applying a graduated percentage to each invoice s relative aging category 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate as of the reporting dates 
changes may occur in the future  which may make us reassess the collectibility of amounts and at which time we may need to provide additional allowances in excess of that currently provided 
at december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively

form k loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies such as the risks associated with estimates included in both our restructuring liability and our professional services fixed fee contracts 
we consider the likelihood of the loss or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
for our restructuring liability  we estimate the amounts for employee severances  impaired assets and vacated office space 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of any asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
for our office lease restructuring liability  our estimate is based on our assessment of our predicted sublease income over the remaining lease term 
included in our accrual at december  is estimated sublease income of  if our actual sublease income is less than projected  our estimated office lease obligation could be adversely affected 
in addition  since we perform some of our professional services on a fixed fee basis  if we incur more costs than estimated  our profitability will suffer 
our process for tracking our progress to completion on such arrangements is through individual detailed project plans and the regular review of labor hours incurred compared to estimated hours to complete the project 
we believe this process results in a reasonable estimate of our progress to completion 
when estimates of costs to complete the project indicate that a loss will be incurred  these losses are estimated and recognized immediately 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such recorded losses should be adjusted 
valuation allowance we provided a valuation allowance against our entire net deferred tax asset  primarily consisting of net operating loss carryforwards as of december  the valuation allowance was recorded given the losses we incurred through december   and our uncertainties regarding future operating profitability and taxable income 
if we do not achieve profitability  we will not fully realize the deferred tax benefits 
revenues our revenues consist of corio application management services revenues and professional services revenues 
for customers that engage us to perform implementation services  we typically recognize professional services revenues as we implement our applications 
we then recognize monthly fees from the customer  consisting primarily of application management services revenues  over the related application management service contractual term 
our professional services revenues associated with implementation initially had been relatively high compared to revenues for application management services 
as our customer base has grown  application management services revenues has correspondingly grown as a percentage of revenues 
in the ordinary course of business  we have recorded revenue in the year ended december   million arising from transactions with four companies with which we have directors in common 
at december   accounts receivable included  arising from such transactions 
in the year ended december   we recorded revenue of million arising from transactions with five companies with which we have directors in common

at december   accounts receivable included approximately  arising from such transactions 
application management services revenues 
revenues from application management services consist of monthly fees from ongoing services as well as start up fees which are recognized ratably over the contract term  which is typically two to three years 
we also recognize revenues in respect of customer prepayments for application management services over the contract term 
in addition  fees for support services are recognized as revenue as the services are performed 
we price our application management services based on various factors  such as the number and type of applications being licensed  the amount of hardware and software required  the number of users covered by a contract and the frequency of access to our applications 
the monthly fee for our application management services is typically fixed for the life of the contract  subject to increases in the event a customer requires additional applications  increases its number of users or increases frequency of use 
application management services revenues comprised  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our standard contract terms include provisions for settlement fees in the event that a customer terminates its contract prior to the expiry of the term 
these settlement fees are recognized as revenue when received 
because these events are unpredictable and uncertain  the amount received in any one quarter may vary significantly and there may not be any settlement fees in some future quarters 
included in fiscal year results are settlement fees arising from early terminations of approximately million 
included in fiscal year results are settlement fees arising from early terminations of approximately million and the recognition of prepaid revenue in the amount of  from a customer that had filed for bankruptcy 
there were no customer settlement fees included in fiscal year revenue 
these termination and settlement fees were primarily the result of emerging high growth companies experiencing financial difficulties or discontinuing operations 
as we move up market and away from high growth companies  revenue from termination and settlement fees may diminish 
professional services and other revenues 
revenues from professional services consist of fees derived from providing implementation  consulting  training and related services for our customers 
we perform these professional services pursuant to fixed fee or time and materials contracts 
we generally recognize revenues from the delivery of professional services as we perform the services under time and materials contracts or under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
we record losses resulting from fixed fee contracts at the time the losses become known 
professional services and other revenues comprised  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
since we implement some of our services on a fixed fee basis  if we incur more costs than we expect in implementations  our profitability will suffer 
our process for tracking our progress to completion on such arrangements  is through individual detailed project plans and the regular review of labor hours incurred compared to estimated hours to complete the project 
when estimates of costs to complete the project indicate that a loss will be incurred  these losses are recognized immediately 
at december   we had an accrual of  for identified losses on contracts in progress at december  the corresponding accrual at december  was  any estimation process  including that which is used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
to the extent that our estimates of revenues and expenses on these contracts change periodically in the normal course of business  due to the modifications of our contractual arrangements or changes in cost  such changes would be reflected in the results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period the revisions are made 
we record payments received in advance of revenue recognition as deferred revenues 
our deferred revenues were million at december  and million at december  deferred revenues at december  and december  included  and  respectively of professional

form k services revenues that will be recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting and million and million respectively of prepaid application management services revenue that will be recognized ratably as earned over the term of the contract 
we sometimes invoice for an advance payment from customers under professional services engagements  and our current payment terms under each type of arrangement is generally net days 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of any asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
during the fiscal years ended december  and  we incurred impairment charges of million and  respectively 
the impairment charges were determined following completion of a fixed asset inventory during the fourth quarters of fiscal years and and relate primarily to abandoned or excess fixed assets  following our restructuring activities undertaken during the last two years

there were no revenues from customer contract terminations in fiscal the increase in revenue from to was mainly attributable to the million related to the acquired qcs contracts and a million increase in payments from cash basis customers offset by a loss of certain customers 
we anticipate fiscal revenue compared to fiscal revenue may increase as we recognize a full year of revenues associated with the contracts acquired from qcs instead of the approximate three months of related revenues in this revenue increase from qcs customers will be offset by the revenue loss from any customers that terminate 
the increase in revenue from to was mainly attributable to a million increase in non recurring revenues from customer contract terminations  million increase in payments from cash basis customers and an increase in the average monthly revenue per customer 
we anticipate that non recurring revenue from customer contract terminations will continue to vary over the next few periods 
as we move away from high growth companies  revenue from termination fees may decrease 
at december   our total number of application management customers was  at december   and at december  at december   we had approximately application management contracts  compared with approximately at december  and with approximately at december  the increase in the number of customers from to is mainly attributable to the customers acquired through our qcs acquisition offset by customers who have terminated

classification as held for sale is an important distinction since such assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value and carrying amount

form k additional factors that may affect future results risk factors risks related to our business we have a history of losses and expect that we will continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flow and may never be profitable 
we have spent significant funds to date to develop and refine our current services  to create and run our operations organization  to build and run a professional services organization and to develop and run our sales and marketing resources 
we have incurred significant operating and net losses and negative cash flow and have not achieved profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to invest significantly in our organization to provide services  enhance current services and expand our service offerings 
we also may grow our sales force and spend significant funds to promote our company and our services 
we may hire additional people in other areas of our company in order to support our business 
in addition  we expect to continue to incur significant fixed and other costs associated with customer acquisitions and with the implementation and configuration of software applications for customers 
as a result of all of these factors  to achieve operating profitability at all or on a consistent basis  excluding non cash charges  we will need to increase our customer base  to decrease our overall costs of providing services  including the costs of our licensed technology  our operations and the costs of customer acquisitions  and to increase our number of customers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase our revenues or increase our operating efficiencies in this manner 
also  because we may continue to invest in our business faster than we anticipate growth in our revenues  we may continue to incur significant losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future and we may never be profitable 
the emerging high growth and middle market companies that currently comprise a significant portion of our revenue base may be volatile  which could continue to result in greater than expected customer loss and continued difficulty in collecting fees from some customers  and uncertainty regarding the stability of the economy in general could continue to adversely affect demand for our services 
a significant portion of our current revenue consists of revenue from middle market companies  e commerce trading exchanges and other technology companies 
these companies will be more likely to be acquired  experience financial difficulties or cease operations than other companies that are larger and better established or are in more stable industries 
in particular  these companies may experience difficulties in raising capital needed to fund their operations when required or at all 
in the past we have terminated our agreements with a substantial number of customers who were unable or unwilling to continue to meet their financial obligations to us and we expect to terminate additional customers in the future 
as a result  our client base will likely be more volatile than those companies whose customers consist of more mature and established entities 
if we continue to experience greater than expected customer loss or an inability to collect fees from our customers in a timely manner because of this volatility  our operating results could be seriously harmed 
in addition  uncertainty regarding the stability of the economy in general could continue to diminish and delay demand for our services 
also  as we move up market and away from high growth and middle market companies  revenue from termination fees resulting from high growth and middle market companies may diminish 
moreover  one of our customers represented of total revenues in fiscal and its contract expires in may we do not expect this customer to renew its contract and so we expect to lose the revenue from this customer starting in june for the quarter ended december   a different customer accounted for of total revenues 
the loss of this and any other significant customers would adversely affect our business

form k our limited history of offering asp services to customers and the fact that we operate in a new industry for application services expose us to risks that affect our ability to execute our business model 
we have offered our services for a relatively short period of time  and our industry is relatively new 
prior to september  our predecessor company  dsci  carried on a different business 
accordingly  we have a limited operating history as a provider of asp services 
we have a limited number of customers and have implemented our services a limited number of times 
because our business model is new  it continues to evolve 
in the future  we may revise our pricing model for different services  and our model for our customers to gain access to third party software applications and other third party services is evolving 
changes in our anticipated business and financial model could materially impact our ability to become profitable in the future 
additionally  especially as we move up market to larger  more established customers  the demand for our services is uncertain and the sales process will take longer than with smaller potential customers 
an investor in our common stock must consider these facts as well as the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as the market for internet based software application services 
some of the risks and difficulties relate to our potential inability to acquire and retain new customers  particularly larger  more established companies required to create a stable revenue and customer base  acquire new customers at a rate sufficient to create growth taking into account loss of customers  reduce costs associated with the delivery of services to our customers  expand and maintain our pipeline of sales prospects in order to promote greater predictability in our period to period sales levels  acquire or license third party software applications at a reasonable cost or at a structure beneficial to us  complete successful implementations of our software applications in a manner that is repeatable and scalable  integrate successfully software applications we manage with each other and with our customers existing systems  continue to offer new services that complement our existing offerings  increase awareness of our brand  and maintain our current  and develop new  strategic relationships 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully address these risks or difficulties 
if we fail to address any of these risks or difficulties adequately  we will likely be unable to execute our business model 
because we may spend significant sums to run our business and to try to grow our business  we may be unable to adjust spending to offset any future revenue shortfall  which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and our stock price to fall 
although we are monitoring our spending  in order to promote future growth  we expect we may continue to expend significant sums in our business  in our operations  professional services  research and development  and sales and marketing organizations 
because the expenses associated with these activities are relatively fixed in the short term  we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenue growth or any decrease in revenue levels 
as our quarterly results fluctuate  they may fall short of the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock may fall 

table of contents corio  inc 
form k our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to the nature of our asp business and other factors affecting our revenues and costs  which could cause our stock price to fall 
our financial results will vary over time as our asp business matures 
for individual customers  we may recognize professional services revenues associated with the implementation of our applications during the early months of our engagement 
we then recognize monthly fees from the customer  consisting primarily of application management services revenues  over the balance of the contractual relationship 
as a result  for some customers we have a high proportion of up front professional services revenues associated with implementation 
we expect that our financial results may continue to vary over time as monthly fees increase as a portion of total revenue 
third parties also provide professional services for some of our application management services customers  and whether professional services will be provided by us or by third parties may be difficult to predict 
changes in our revenue mix from professional services revenues to application management services revenues could be difficult to predict and could cause our quarterly results and stock price to fluctuate 
other important factors that could cause our quarterly results and stock price to fluctuate materially include the timing of obtaining  implementing and establishing connectivity with individual customers  the loss of or change in our relationship with important customers and our ability or inability to collect termination fees from terminating customers  any decrease in termination fees paid in a quarter versus other quarters  the timing and magnitude of expanding our operations and of other capital expenditures  costs  including license fees  relating to the software applications we use  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  potential changes in the accounting standards associated with accounting for stock or warrant issuances and for revenue recognition  and accounting charges associated with the warrants currently held by third parties  as well as potential accounting charges we may incur in the future relating to stock or warrant issuances to future parties 
our financial results could vary over time as our business model evolves  which could cause our stock price to fall 
our financial results could vary over time as our business and financial model evolves 
for example  we historically included a broad range of customer support in our fixed monthly fees but now bill certain customers for support services in excess of specified limits in certain circumstances 
as another example  we are increasingly unbundling from our fixed monthly fee the cost of software licenses and currently require our customers to obtain licenses to enterprise software applications directly from third party software providers 
any such changes to our business or financial model would likely cause financial results to vary  which could cause our stock price to fall 
in this regard  from time to time we negotiate with some of our major third party software vendors to modify the pricing and other terms currently in place with these vendors 
we may agree to restructure our current arrangements with some of our third party software providers 
for example  we are migrating customers  and currently plan to eventually migrate all customers  from a model whereby some rent enterprise application licenses from us to a model whereby they all purchase the licenses directly from independent software vendors 
such new pricing structures or business models may not in fact be more beneficial to us and may ultimately hinder our ability to become profitable 

table of contents corio  inc 
form k we depend on software vendors to supply us with the software necessary to provide our services  and the loss of access to this software or any decline or obsolescence in its functionality could cause our customers businesses to suffer  which  in turn  could harm our revenues and increase our costs 
we offer our customers software application services for applications from third parties such as peoplesoft  oracle  sap and siebel systems 
we have agreements in place with certain of our third party software vendors  and our agreements with third party software vendors are non exclusive  are for limited terms and typically permit termination in the event of our breach of the agreements 
additionally  as we move more to host only relationships  whereby our customers must obtain licenses directly from independent software vendors such as peoplesoft and siebel  we rely on the independent software vendors to consent to allow us to access the software to provide our services 
if we lose the right to use the software that we host from third parties  if the cost of licensing the software applications becomes prohibitive  or if we change the vendors from whom we currently license software  our customers businesses could be significantly disrupted  which could harm our revenues and increase our costs 
our financial results may also be harmed if the cost structure we negotiate with the third party software vendors changes in a manner that is less beneficial to us compared to our current cost structure with software vendors 
we cannot assure you that our services will continue to support the software of our third party vendors  or that we will be able to adapt our own offerings to changes in third party software 
in addition  if our vendors were to experience financial or other difficulties  it could adversely affect the availability of their software 
it is also possible that improvements in software by third parties with whom we have no relationship could render the software we offer to our customers less compelling or obsolete 
our licenses for the third party software we use to deliver our services contain limits on our ability to use them that could impair our growth and operating results 
the licenses we have for the third party software for which we provide hosting or application management services typically restrict our ability to sell our services in specified countries and to customers with revenue above or below specified revenue levels 
for example  some of our licenses restrict us from selling our services to customers with annual revenues greater than various levels such as billion  and some restrict our ability to sell to customers outside of north america 
in addition  some of these licenses contain limits on our ability to sell our services to certain types of customers 
our operating results and ability to grow could be harmed to the extent these licenses prohibit us from selling our services to customers to which we would otherwise sell our services  or in countries in which we would otherwise sell our services 
poor performance of the software we deliver to our customers or disruptions in our business critical services could harm our reputation  delay market acceptance of our services and subject us to liabilities 
our customers depend on our hosted software applications for their critical systems and business functions  including enterprise resource planning  customer relationship management and e commerce 
our customers businesses could be seriously harmed if the applications we provide to them work improperly or fail  even if only temporarily 
accordingly  if the software that we license from our vendors or our implementation or ongoing management of such software performs poorly  experiences errors or defects or is otherwise unreliable  our customers would likely be extremely dissatisfied  which could cause our reputation to suffer  force us to divert research and development and management resources  cause a loss of revenues or hinder market acceptance of our services 
it is also possible that any customer disruptions resulting from failures in our applications could force us to refund all or a portion of the fees customers have paid for our services or result in other significant liabilities to our customers 
we may fail to implement  host or manage enterprise software applications successfully due to the complicated nature of the services we provide and our limited experience in providing these services  which would harm our reputation and sales 
implementations of enterprise software applications can be complicated and we have limited experience to date completing implementations of software applications for our customers 
we cannot assure you that we will 
table of contents corio  inc 
form k develop the requisite expertise or that we can convince customers that we have the expertise required to implement  host or manage these applications 
our reputation will be harmed and sales of our services would decline significantly if we are not able to complete successfully repeated implementations of our enterprise software applications  including those applications with which we have limited or no implementation  hosting or management experience to date 
any inability to expand sufficiently our enterprise software implementation and systems consulting capabilities could harm our ability to service our customers effectively and could hinder our growth 
a failure to maintain and expand relationships with third party systems integrators that we use to implement our services could harm our ability to service our customers effectively 
as we seek to provide applications management services for larger  more established customers  they may frequently utilize the systems integration and consulting services of independent  third party systems integrators rather than corio 
in such cases  we may receive only modest revenue for implementation and integration services if any 
in addition  we frequently contract with our customers for implementation on a fixed price basis 
as a result  unexpected complexities in implementing software applications for our customers could result in unexpected losses for us or increases in losses 
our business and reputation could also be seriously harmed if third party systems integrators were unable to perform their services for our customers in a manner that meets customer expectations 
increased demand for customization of our services beyond what we currently provide or anticipate could reduce the scalability and profitability of our business 
companies may prefer more customized applications and services than our business model contemplates 
most of our customers have required some level of customization of our services  and our customers may continue to require customization in the future  perhaps to a greater extent than we currently provide or anticipate 
if we do not offer the desired customization  there may be less demand for our services 
conversely  providing customization of our services increases our costs and reduces our flexibility to provide similar services to many customers 
accordingly  increased demand for customization of our services could reduce the scalability and profitability of our business and increase risks associated with completing software upgrades 
growth could strain our operations and require us to incur costs to upgrade our infrastructure and expand our personnel 
if our customer base grows significantly  we cannot be sure that we will successfully manage our growth 
in order to manage any such growth successfully  we must expand our management team  financial and information systems and controls and operations team  maintain a high level of customer service and support  expand our implementation and consulting resources internally and with third parties  and expand  train  manage and retain our employee base effectively 
if our customer base grows significantly  there will be additional demands on our customer service support  research and development  sales and marketing and administrative resources as we try to increase our service offerings and expand our target markets 
any delay in the implementation of  or disruption in the transition to  new or enhanced systems and controls could harm our ability to accurately forecast demand for our services  manage our billing of customers  manage our sales cycle and implementation services and record and report management and financial information on a timely and accurate basis 
moreover  any inability to expand our service offerings and employee base commensurate with any increase in the demand for our services could cause our revenues to decline

form k we will need to perform software upgrades for our customers  and any inability to successfully perform these upgrades could cause interruptions or errors in our customers software applications  which could increase our costs and delay market acceptance of our services 
our software vendors from time to time will upgrade their software applications  and at such time we will be required to implement these software upgrades for certain of our customers 
implementing software upgrades can be a complicated and costly process  particularly implementation of an upgrade simultaneously across multiple customers  and we have not performed many software upgrades to date 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to perform these upgrades successfully or at a reasonable cost 
we may also experience difficulty implementing software upgrades to a large number of customers  particularly if different software vendors release upgrades simultaneously 
if we are unable to perform software upgrades successfully and to a large customer base  our customers could be subject to increased risk of interruptions or errors in their business critical software  our reputation and business would likely suffer and the market would likely delay the acceptance of our services 
it will also be difficult for us to predict the timing of these upgrades  the cost to us of these upgrades and the additional resources that we may need to implement these upgrades 
additionally  as we continue to evolve our business model to charge customers for the cost of software upgrades  we may lose prospective customers who choose not to pay for these upgrades 
therefore  any such upgrades could strain our development and engineering resources  require significant unexpected expenses and cause us to miss our financial forecasts or those of securities analysts 
any of these problems could impair our customer relations and our reputation and subject us to litigation 
security risks and concerns may decrease the demand for our services  and security breaches with respect to our systems may disrupt our services or make them inaccessible to our customers 
our services involve the storage and transmission of business critical  proprietary information  and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information  litigation and possible liability 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate business critical proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or operations 
in addition  computer hackers could introduce computer viruses into our systems or those of our customers  which could disrupt our services or make them inaccessible to customers 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  and our business and reputation would be harmed if we do not prevent them 
if we are unable to adapt our services to rapidly changing technology  our reputation and our ability to grow our revenues could be harmed 
the markets we serve are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  emerging competition and the frequent introduction of new services  software and other products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enhance existing or develop new services that meet changing customer needs in a timely and cost effective manner 
for example  as software application architecture changes  the software for which we provide services could become out of date or obsolete and we may be forced to upgrade or replace our technology 
for example  this is of particular concern with regard to our enterprise resource planning  or erp  software  including peoplesoft  oracle and sap 
the architecture of the software we currently use for erp applications is not designed to be hosted 
we believe that future software may be written to be hosted 
our existing software application providers may face competition from new vendors who have written hostable software 
it may be difficult for us to acquire hostable erp software from these new vendors and for our software application providers to develop this software quickly or successfully 
in either event  the services we offer would likely become less attractive to our customers  which could cause us to lose revenue and market share 
performing upgrades may also require substantial time and expense and even then we cannot be sure that we will succeed in adapting our business to these technological developments 
prolonged delays resulting from 
table of contents corio  inc 
form k our efforts to adapt to rapid technological change  even if ultimately successful  could harm our reputation within our industry and our ability to grow our revenues 
we may incur substantial accounting charges as a result of repurchasable common stock held by cap gemini ernst young which may result in significant operating losses over the next several years 
on september   cap gemini ernst young us  usc cgey  exercised its right to convert a portion of its initial warrant representing  shares into  shares of common stock through a cashless exercise 
even if we are able to generate revenues that exceed our operating costs  we may incur substantial accounting charges through may associated with these shares held by cgey 
these shares and other expenses related to our strategic alliance with cgey may result in expenses and operating losses for us over the term of our agreement with them 
because of the accounting policies applicable to these shares  any charges associated with these shares will be measured and recorded each fiscal quarter in part using the trading price of our common stock 
significant increases in our stock price could result in significant non cash accounting charges 
our application management agreements are typically long term  fixed price contracts  which may hinder our ability to become profitable 
we enter into agreements with our customers to provide application management services for long periods  typically two to three years 
most of these agreements are in the form of fixed price contracts that do not provide for price adjustments to reflect any cost overruns associated with providing our services  such as potential increases in the costs of software applications we license from third parties  the costs of upgrades or inflation 
as a result  unless we are able to provide our services in a more cost effective manner than we do today and unless the number of users at individual customers increases to provide us higher revenue levels per customer  we may never achieve profitability for a particular customer 
in addition  customers may not be able to pay us or may cancel our services before becoming profitable for us 
our long term  fixed price application management contracts may hinder our ability to evolve our business and to ultimately become profitable 
our business is relatively new and  accordingly  our business and financial models may evolve as the understanding of our business evolves 
we may be unable to adjust our pricing or cost structure with respect to our current customers in response to changes we make in our business or financial model due to the long term  fixed price nature of the application management agreements we have with our customers 
this potential inflexibility may result in our inability to become profitable as rapidly as we would like or at all 
if we do not meet the service levels provided for in our contracts with customers  we may be required to give our customers credit for free service  and our customers may be entitled to cancel their service contracts  which could adversely affect our reputation and hinder our ability to grow our revenues 
our application management services contracts contain service level guarantees that obligate us to provide our applications at a guaranteed level of performance 
if we fail to meet those service levels  we may be contractually obligated to provide our customers credit for free service 
if we were to continue to fail to meet these service levels  our customers would then have the right to cancel their contracts with us 
these credits or cancellations could harm our reputation and hinder our ability to grow our revenues 
if we cannot obtain additional software applications that meet the evolving business needs of our customers  the market for our services may not grow and may decline  and sales of our services may suffer

we have many competitors and expect new competitors to enter our market  which could adversely affect our ability to increase revenues  maintain our margins or grow our market share 
the market for our services is extremely competitive and the barriers to entry in our market are relatively low

our current and potential competitors primarily include application service providers and business process outsourcers  such as bluestar solutions  csc  electronic data systems  hewlett packard  ibm global services  surebridge and usinternetworking  systems integrators  such as accenture  bearing point  software vendors  such as oracle  peoplesoft  commerce one  sap and siebel systems  and major technology providers  such as microsoft 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  customer support  technical and marketing resources  larger customer bases  longer operating histories  greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do 
we cannot be sure that we will have the resources or expertise to compete successfully in the future 
our competitors may be able to develop and expand their network infrastructures and service offerings more quickly  adapt to new or emerging technologies and changing customer needs faster  take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily  negotiate more favorable agreements with software application vendors  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products  and address customers service related issues more effectively 
some of our competitors may also be able to provide customers with additional benefits at lower overall costs or to reduce their application service charges aggressively in an effort to increase market share 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to match cost reductions by our competitors 
our competitors and other companies may form strategic relationships with each other to compete with us 
these relationships may take the form of strategic investments  joint marketing agreements  licenses or other contractual arrangements  which arrangements may increase our competitors ability to address customer needs with their product and service offerings 
we believe that there is likely to be consolidation in our markets  which could lead to increased price competition and other forms of competition that could cause our business to suffer

in addition  if we were unable to list our common stock for trading on the nasdaq national market  many institutional investors would no longer be able to retain their interests in and or make further investments in our common stock because of their internal rules and protocols 
if institutional shareholders liquidated their holdings in our common stock and or did not continue to make investments in our common stock  this would decrease the trading volume of our shares and would likely result in a lower price for our common stock 
also  as mentioned above  to come into compliance with nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement  we may effect a reverse stock split which could adversely affect our stock price

form k risks related to our industry we cannot assure you that the asp market will become viable or grow at a rate that will allow us to achieve profitability 
growth in demand for and acceptance of asps and their hosted business software applications is highly uncertain 
this is especially true given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment 
companies in the asp industry  such as pandesic and red gorilla  have ceased operations 
other companies in the asp industry  such as usinternetworking  have filed for bankruptcy 
we cannot assure you that this market will become viable or  if it becomes viable  that it will grow at a rate that will allow us to achieve profitability 
the market for internet services  private network management solutions and widely distributed internet enabled application software has only recently begun to develop and is now evolving rapidly 
we believe that many of our potential customers are not fully aware of the benefits of hosted and managed solutions 
it is possible that these solutions will never achieve market acceptance 
it is also possible that potential customers will decide that the risks associated with hiring asps in general or smaller asps in particular to implement and manage their critical systems and business functions outweigh the efficiencies associated with the products and services we provide 
concerns over transaction security and user privacy  inadequate network infrastructure for the entire internet and inconsistent performance of the internet and the financial viability of asps could also limit the growth of internet based business software solutions 
increasing government regulation could limit the market for  or impose sales and other taxes on the sale of  our services  which could cause our revenues to decline or increase our expenses 
we offer our suite of software applications over networks  which subject us to government regulation concerning internet usage and electronic commerce 
we expect that state  federal and foreign agencies will adopt and modify regulations covering issues such as user and data privacy  pricing  taxation of goods and services provided over the internet  the use and export of cryptographic technology and content and quality of products and services 
it is possible that legislation could expose us and other companies involved in electronic commerce to liability or require permits or other authorizations  which could limit the growth of electronic commerce generally 
legislation could dampen the growth in internet usage and decrease its acceptance as a communications and commercial medium 
if enacted  these laws  rules or regulations could limit the market for or make it more difficult to offer our services 
the taxation of commerce activities in connection with the internet has not been established  may change in the future and may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
one or more states or countries may seek to impose sales or other taxes on companies that engage in or facilitate electronic commerce 
a number of proposals have been made at the local  state  national and international levels that would impose additional taxes on the sale of products and services over the internet 
these proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of electronic commerce and could subject us to taxation relating to our use of the internet as a means of delivering our services 
moreover  if any state or country were to assert successfully that we should collect sales or other taxes on the exchange of products and services over the internet  our customers may refuse to continue using our services  which could cause our revenues to decline significantly 
if we expand our business outside the united states we will be subject to unfavorable international conditions and regulations that could cause our international business to fail 
we have customers with international operations and may expand our business outside of the united states in the future 
conducting our business in international markets is subject to complexities associated with foreign operations and to additional risks related to our business  including the possibility that the scarcity of cost effective  high speed internet access and the slow pace of future improvements in access to the internet will limit the market for hosting software applications over the internet or adversely affect the delivery of our services to

the european union has adopted a privacy directive that regulates the collection and use of information 
this directive may inhibit or prohibit the collection and sharing of personal information in ways that could harm us 
the globalization of internet commerce may be harmed by these and similar regulations since the european union privacy directive prohibits transmission of personal information outside the european union unless the receiving country has enacted individual privacy protection laws at least as strong as those enacted by the european union privacy directive 
general political and economic conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our business 
because of the economic downturn and political environment  many industries have delayed or reduced technology expenditures 
if this trend continues  we may fall short of our revenue expectations  and ultimately may fail to achieve profitability 
moreover  weakness in the technology sector as a whole could negatively affect the cash flow of some of our customers  which in turn could impact their ability to meet their obligations to us as they come due 
this could increase our credit risk exposure and harm our overall financial position 
in addition  global and domestic political conditions  terrorist acts  or acts of war wherever located in the world may damage or disrupt global and domestic markets and negatively affect our business  employees  customers  and suppliers  which in turn could have an adverse effect on our operations and our overall profitability 
market prices of internet and technology companies have been highly volatile  and the market for our stock may be volatile as well 
the stock market has experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations  and the market prices of technology companies generally  and internet related software companies particularly  have been extremely volatile 
the market prices of technology companies generally  and technology service companies in particular have been subject to significant downward pressure 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a public company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such litigation could result in substantial costs to us and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
many significant corporate actions are controlled by our officers  directors and affiliated entities regardless of the opposition of other investors or the desire of other investors to pursue an alternative cause of action 
our executive officers  directors and entities affiliated with them  in the aggregate  beneficially own approximately of our common stock at december  if they were to act together  these stockholders would be able to exercise control over most matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company  which could cause our stock price to drop 
these actions may be taken even if they are opposed by the other investors  including those who purchased shares in the initial public offering 
delaware law and our charter  bylaws and contracts provide anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition of us  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of delaware law  our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and contracts could delay  defer or prevent an acquisition or change of control of us  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders  and this could adversely affect the price of our common stock

several members of our senior management have contracts with us that provide for the acceleration of the vesting of their stock options upon termination following a change of control 
our certificate of incorporation permits our board to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
in addition to delaying or preventing an acquisition  the issuance of a substantial number of shares of preferred stock could adversely affect the price of the common stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about financial market risk we develop and market our services primarily in the united states 
as we expand our operations outside of the united states  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
because all of our revenues are currently denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our services less competitive in international markets 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including government securities  commercial paper  corporate bonds and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
maturing in three months or less between three months and seventeen months december  in thousands  except percentages included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rate
