we also refer to trademarks of other corporations and organizations in this document 
overview incyte is a drug discovery company that develops proprietary genomic information and applies its expertise in medicinal chemistry and molecular  cellular and in vivo biology to the discovery of novel small molecule and protein therapeutics 
we believe we have created the largest commercial portfolio of issued united states patents covering human  full length genes and the proteins they encode  and license this intellectual property  as well as market our genomic and proteomic information  to many of the world s leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic research centers 
we have assembled an experienced and talented drug discovery team that is identifying potential new drug therapies for cancer  inflammatory diseases and other medical conditions 
we were incorporated in delaware in april and  until  devoted substantially all of our resources to the development  marketing and sales of genomics technologies and products to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries and research and academic institutions to aid in better and faster prevention  diagnosis and treatment of disease 
our products and services included databases  bioreagents  custom sequencing  gene expression  single nucleotide polymorphism  or snp  discovery  and other services 
over time  we also increased our investments in growing our intellectual property estate to protect our proprietary information as well as our internal and collaborative efforts to identify and validate drug targets 
during  we increased our focus on our therapeutic discovery and development program  and we exited the following activities microarray products and related services  genomic screening products and services  public domain clone products and related services  contract sequencing services  transgenic products and services and snp discovery services 
our business is now focused on our therapeutic discovery and development programs and our information products 
our current products include information databases  intellectual property licensing  and certain other products  such as full length clones 
the fees and the period of access to our database information are negotiated independently with each company 
in addition to providing access to pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers  we also provide access to our database to third parties who use the database to develop genomic tools  such as microarrays that require genomic content  which they in turn sell to pharmaceutical and biotechnology researchers 
fees payable by pharmaceutical and biotechnology collaborators for our information products also generally consist of non exclusive or exclusive fees corresponding to patent rights on proprietary genes and proteins 
we may also receive future milestone and royalty payments from collaborators from the development and sale of their products derived from our technology and database information 
we expect that the overall market for our information products will continue to be competitive based on softening of the market for genomic information  shrinking research budgets of our current and potential customers and industry consolidation 
revenue trends indicate that subscribers are being more cautious with their spending to focus more of their resources on late stage research and clinical products than in the past  and this has adversely impacted the pricing of and  in some cases  the length of the contractual commitment for  our information products 
we expect this trend to continue into and that revenues in will be lower than those recognized in the prior year 
we intend to manage our information products on a cash flow positive basis 
our ability to earn revenues and successfully manage our information products on a cash flow positive basis depends  in large part  on our ability to attract new customers and retain new and existing customers for our information products in an increasingly competitive market environment 
further  we have only received limited royalty revenues to date  and do not expect to receive significant royalty or other revenues from development and commercialization by our customers using our information products for several years  if at all 
revenues from our customers may be subject to significant fluctuation in both timing and amount and  therefore  our results of operations for any period may not be comparable to the results of operations for any other period 
in conjunction with the restructuring program  we expect to reduce certain annual expenses by over million beginning in  compared with  through a combination of decreased spending  job reductions and office consolidations 
the restructuring programs will have little impact on our therapeutic discovery and development programs as we intend to continue to invest in research and development for our therapeutic discovery and development efforts 
we expect these expenses to continue to increase in and that these increases will partially offset our expected expense reductions from the restructuring program 
we anticipate incurring additional losses for several years as we expand our therapeutic drug discovery and development programs 
we also expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
we do not expect to generate revenues from our therapeutic discovery and development efforts for several years  if at all 
if we are unable to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products over the next several years  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted 
our investment portfolio includes equity and debt investments in publicly traded and privately held companies 
may of these companies are still in the start up or development stage 
our investments in these companies are inherently risky because they technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never become successful 
the market values of many of these investments can fluctuate significantly 
current market conditions may cause us to write down the value of our investments which could result in future charges to our earnings 
the determination of investment impairment involves significant management judgement  and actual amounts realized for any specific investment may differ from recorded values 
because the market value of strategic investments that we hold can fluctuate significantly  and such fluctuations are highly variable and not within our control  any future gains or losses related to strategic investments have not been included in earnings estimates for during and  we reported charges of million and million  respectively  relating to restructuring programs and long lived asset write downs announced in the fourth quarter of each year 
a discussion of each of these restructuring programs follows during  we exited certain product lines and  as a result of exiting these activities  we closed certain of our facilities in fremont  california  palo alto  california  st 
louis  missouri and cambridge  united kingdom 
in addition to the product lines exited  we made infrastructure and other personnel reductions at our locations resulting in an aggregate workforce reduction of approximately employees 
a charge for the restructuring program and impairment of long lived assets of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of as a result of the change in focus 
this charge was comprised of the following items million goodwill and intangibles impairment  million restructuring charges including million in equipment and other assets impaired and million impairment of a long lived asset 
revenues from exited product lines for the years ended and were million and million  respectively 
additional charges for restructuring expenses of million were recorded in  primarily for contract related settlements  impairment of long lived assets and facilities lease expenses in excess of estimated amounts  offset by the release of other restructuring accruals in excess of actual expenses 
on november   we announced plans to reduce our expenditures  primarily in research and development  through a combination of spending reductions  workforce reductions and office consolidations 
the expense reduction plan included elimination of approximately of our workforce in palo alto  california  beverly  massachusetts  and cambridge  england and consolidation of our office and research facilities in palo alto  california 
as a result of these actions  we incurred a charge of million during the fourth quarter of in november  we entered into an agreement to acquire maxia pharmaceuticals  inc  a privately held company based in san diego  california 
maxia is a drug discovery and development company that specializes in small molecule drugs targeting diabetes and other metabolic disorders  cancer  inflammatory diseases and heart disease 
on february   one of our wholly owned subsidiaries was merged with and into maxia 
as a result of the merger maxia became a wholly owned subsidiary of incyte  each share of maxia common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive of a share of our common stock  each share of maxia series a preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive of a share of our common stock  and each share of maxia series b preferred stock and maxia series c preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive of a share of our common stock and in cash 
the former stockholders of maxia received  in the aggregate  approximately  shares of our common stock and approximately  in cash upon the consummation of the merger 
we also assumed outstanding third party indebtedness of approximately  million in cash and  shares of our common stock was paid to certain debt holders of maxia 
the cash portion of the purchase price was provided from our existing cash balances 
in addition  upon the consummation of the merger  all outstanding shares of maxia series a additional payments  maxia series b additional payments  maxia series c additional payments and maxia common additional payments were converted  in the aggregate  into the right to receive up to  shares of our common stock and  in cash on the second anniversary of the consummation of the merger  and up to  shares of our common stock and  in cash on the third anniversary of the consummation of the merger 
further  all outstanding shares of maxia series a earn out  maxia series b earn out  maxia series c earn out and maxia common earn out were converted  in the aggregate  into the right to receive certain earn out amounts of up to a potential aggregate amount of million upon the occurrence of certain milestones set forth in the merger agreement 
twenty percent of each earn out payment  if earned  will be paid in cash and the remaining eighty percent will be paid in shares of our common stock such that an aggregate of million in cash and million in our common stock could potentially be paid pursuant to the earn out milestones 
the milestones occur as maxia products enter various stages of human clinical trials and may be earned at any time prior to the tenth anniversary of the consummation of the merger 
prior to entering into the merger agreement  in august  we loaned maxia million in exchange for the right to negotiate with maxia exclusively regarding an acquisition or other strategic transaction 
in exchange for the loan  maxia issued a million senior convertible note to us 
interest on the note would have accrued at the rate of per year in the event the negotiations with maxia had terminated 
the note was convertible into shares of any class or series of maxia capital stock at a set conversion price 
this note was applied as a portion of the consideration in the transaction 
in addition  we loaned maxia an aggregate of million to cover their operating expenses during the period between the signing of the merger agreement and the consummation of the merger 
in exchange for the loan  maxia issued to us a second senior convertible note 
through december   we had funded million under this note  which was charged to research and development expense 
although our analysis of purchase price allocation remains incomplete  we expect to record a charge in the first quarter of to the extent our final analysis concludes that total purchase price should be allocated to in process research and development or other expenses 
frederick b 
craves  one of our directors  is a partner of bay city capital  which held shares of maxia stock 
the transaction with maxia was negotiated at arms length and  because dr 
craves is a director of both companies  a special committee of the board of directors  which did not include dr 
craves  was formed to consider and approve this related party transaction 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition valuation of long lived assets accounting for long term investments restructuring charges revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we enter into various types of agreements for access to our information databases  use of our intellectual property and sales of our custom products and services 
revenues are deferred for fees received before earned or until no further obligations exist 
revenues from ongoing database agreements are recognized evenly over the access period 
revenues from licenses to our intellectual property are recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements 
royalty revenues are recognized upon the sale of products or services to third parties by the licensee or other agreed upon terms 
revenues from custom products  such as clones and datasets  are recognized upon completion and delivery 
revenues from custom services are recognized upon completion of contract deliverables 
revenues from gene expression microarray services include technology access fees  which are recognized ratably over the access term  and progress payments  which are recognized at the completion of key stages in the performance of the service in proportion to the costs incurred 
revenues recognized from multiple element contracts are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of the elements 
the determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from historical sales of the individual element by us to other customers 
if such evidence of fair value for each element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 sab  when elements are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation associated with the element is completed 
when revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  they are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
when contracts include non monetary payments  the value of the non monetary transaction is determined using the fair value of the products and services involved  as applicable 
for non monetary payments involving the receipt of equity in a public entity  the fair value is based on the traded stock price on the date revenue is earned 
for non monetary payments involving the receipt of equity in a privately held company  fair value is determined either based on a current or recent arm s length financing by the issuer or upon an independent valuation of the issuer 
valuation of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  which includes property and equipment as well as intangible and other assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could indicate the need for an impairment review include the following significant changes in the strategy of our overall business  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  in accordance with sfas  we perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if impairment exists 
if impairment exists  we measure the impairment based on the difference between the asset s carrying amount and its fair value 
accounting for long term investments 
we monitor our investment portfolio for impairment on a periodic basis 
our investment portfolio includes equity and debt investments in publicly traded and privately held companies 
many of these companies are still in the start up or development stage 
our investments in these companies are inherently risky because the technologies or products they have under developement are typically in the early stages and may never become successful 
investments in publicly traded companies are classified as available for sale and are adjusted to their fair value each period based on their traded market price with any adjustments being recorded in other comprehensive income 
investments in privately held companies are carried at cost 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe that the investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
the determination of whether an impairment is other than temporary consists of a review of qualitative and quantitative factors by members of senior management 
generally  declines that persist for six months or more are considered other than temporary 
we use the best information available in these assessments  however  the information available may be limited 
these determinations involve significant management judgment  and actual amounts realized for any specific investment may differ from the recorded values 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional impairment charges 
restructuring charges 
the restructuring charges resulting from the and restructuring programs have been recorded in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges sab 
the restructuring charges are comprised primarily of costs to exit facilities  reduce our workforce  write off fixed assets  and costs of outside services incurred in the restructuring 
the workforce reduction charge was determined based on the estimated severance and fringe benefit charge for identified employees 
in calculating the cost to exit the facilities  we estimated for each location the amount to be paid in lease termination payments  the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the lease is terminated  the amount  if any  of sublease receipts and real estate broker fees 
this required us to estimate the timing and costs of each lease to be terminated  the amount of operating costs  and the timing and rate at which we might be able to sublease the site 
to form our estimates for these costs  we performed an assessment of the affected facilities and considered the current market conditions for each site 
estimates were also used in our calculation of the estimated realizable value on equipment that is being held for sale 
these estimates were formed based on recent history of sales of similar equipment and market conditions 
our assumptions on either the lease termination payments  operating costs until terminated  the offsetting sublease receipts and estimated realizable value of fixed assets held for sale may turn out to be incorrect and our actual cost may be materially different from our estimates 
results of operations we recorded net losses for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
on a basic and diluted per share basis  net loss was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues 
revenues for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
revenues are derived primarily from information products  which include licensing of our intellectual property  and custom genomics products 
information products include database subscriptions  licensing  and partner programs and represented  and of total net revenues in  and  respectively 
custom genomics includes microarray based gene expression products and services  genomic screening products and services  public domain clone products and related services  contract sequencing and snp discovery services and represented  and of total net revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in revenues in over reflects a softening in the market for genomic information  a reduction in research spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies due in part to consolidations within these industries  their efforts to reduce spending and the concomitant impact on the price of our information products  and the elimination of several lower margin product lines 
our database subscription and licensing revenues have been adversely impacted as subscribers are being more cautious with their spending than in the past 
revenues for the years ended and included million and million  respectively  of revenue associated with the exited custom genomics product lines that was announced in the fourth quarter of the increase in information product revenues in from is primarily due to an increase in licensing of our intellectual property 
for the years ended december   and  revenues from companies considered to be related parties  as defined by sfas were million  million  and million 
our related parties consist of companies in which members of our board of directors have invested  either directly or indirectly  or in which a member of our board of directors is an officer or holds a seat on the board of directors 
revenues received from agreements in which collaborators paid with equity or debt instruments in their company were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additionally  revenues received from agreements in which we concurrently invested funds in the collaborator s equity securities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
revenues recognized from agreements executed prior to in which a concurrent commitment was entered into to purchase goods or services from the other party for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
no transactions in which we had a concurrent commitment to purchase goods or services were entered into during the year ended december  of commitments made in prior periods  we expensed million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the above transactions were recorded at fair value in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
operating expenses 
total costs and expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
in conjunction with the restructuring program  we expect to reduce certain annual expenses by over million beginning in  compared with  through a combination of decreased spending  job reductions and office consolidations 
the restructuring programs will have little impact on our therapeutic discovery and development programs as we intend to continue to invest in research and development for our therapeutic discovery and development efforts 
we expect these expenses to continue to increase in  and that such increases will partially offset our expected expense reductions from the restructuring program 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in from was primarily the result of expenses eliminated in the exit of the custom genomics product lines  partially offset by increased therapeutic discovery and development expenses and certain write offs related to impaired research and development assets 
higher research and development expenses in  when compared with  were primarily the result of having a full year of activity in related to the proteome acquisition  which was completed in december  and an increase in the costs related to our therapeutic discovery and development efforts 
research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of pre clinical and clinical trial related activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in over resulted primarily from the exit of the custom genomics product lines  infrastructure reductions and decreased legal expenses  partially offset by general and administrative expenses incurred to support our therapeutic discovery and development efforts 
the increase in over resulted primarily from having a full year of activity related to the proteome acquisition  which was completed in december  and increased legal expenses related to our patent infringement cases 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include legal expenses of million and million in and  respectively  related to our patent infringement lawsuits with affymetrix and invitrogen  and million in related to our patent infringement lawsuits with affymetrix and genelogic 
regardless of the outcome  the invitrogen litigation is expected to result in future costs to us  which could be substantial 
loss on sale of assets 
loss on sales of assets for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the loss is due to routine disposition of assets in the normal course of business 
the loss in resulted from the divestiture of the transgenics product line and the sale of certain of those assets 
there were no significant sales of assets in other expenses 
other expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  represent charges recorded in connection with restructuring and long lived asset impairments 
in  these expenses consisted of million in workforce reduction  million in equipment and other asset write offs  million in lease commitments and other accruals related to the restructuring announced in the fourth quarter of  and million related to the increase in the restructuring charges 
in  these expenses  of which million were non cash charges  were comprised of the following items related to the restructuring in the fourth quarter of million goodwill and intangibles impairment and million nonrecurring restructuring charges and million impairment of long lived asset 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net  for the years ended december   and  was income of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in from was primarily due to a decrease in cash invested and lower interest rates in  and long term investment impairment charges deemed to be other than temporary  totaling million in  which were lower than impairment charges 
the decrease in from was primarily due to the impact of impairment charges recorded in totaling million on long term investments due to declines in values deemed to be other than temporary 
to a lesser degree  the decrease in the cash and marketable securities average balances for and lower interest rates also contributed to the lower interest income 
the activity on discrete investments within our portfolio  in any given period  may result in gains or losses on sales or impairment charges 
interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in from resulted primarily from the timing impact of the early retirement of million and million face value of our convertible subordinated notes in and  respectively 
the small decrease in from is due to a lower average outstanding balance of our convertible subordinated notes as a result of the timing of issuance in and subsequent repurchases of million face value in and  causing the interest thereon to decrease 
gain loss on certain derivative financial instruments  net 
loss on certain derivative financial instruments for the year ended december  of million and gain on certain derivative financial instruments for the year ended december  of million represents the change in fair value of certain long term investments  specifically warrants held in other companies  in accordance with sfas gain or loss on derivative financial instruments may fluctuate in any given period based upon current market conditions and is recognized during the period of change 
gain on repurchase of convertible subordinated notes 
in  and  we repurchased million  million and million face value of our convertible subordinated notes on the open market  respectively 
the repurchase resulted in a gain of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
losses from joint venture 
we incurred no losses from joint venture for the years ended december  and loss from joint venture was million for the year ended december  in september  we formed a joint venture  diadexus  llc diadexus with smithkline beecham corporation 
the loss represents our share of diadexus losses from operations 
on april   diadexus converted from an llc to a corporation and completed a private equity financing at which time we no longer had significant influence over diadexus 
accordingly  we began accounting for our investment in diadexus under the cost method of accounting as of the date of the financing  and therefore did not include diadexus results of operations in our statement of operations subsequent to that date 
provision for income taxes 
due to our net loss in  and  we had a minimal effective annual income tax rate 
the provisions for income taxes for  and are primarily attributable to foreign withholding taxes 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas supersedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
additionally  sfas establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of the statement on january  will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirement for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  fin 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including residual value guarantees issued in conjunction with operating lease agreements 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf issue no 

eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas to require more prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting apb to require disclosure about the net income effects in interim financial information 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the disclosure provisions of this statement have been included in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
the objective of fin is to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities by requiring the variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  we believe that none of our investments qualify as entities that require consolidation under fin and will adopt this interpretation in the third quarter of fiscal year liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  compared to million as of december  we have classified all of our marketable securities as short term  as we may choose not to hold our marketable securities until maturity in order to take advantage of favorable market conditions 
available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy s primary objectives of liquidity  safety of principal and diversity of investments 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the change in net cash used in as compared to was primarily due to the increase in net loss in  adjusted for non cash items such as restructuring charges and impairment of long lived assets  as well as the decrease in accrued and other liabilities and deferred revenue  offset by higher cash provided by the decrease in accounts receivable in as compared to the change in net cash used in as compared to was primarily due to the increase in net loss in  less non cash restructuring charges and impairment of long lived assets  as well as increases in cash usage for accounts receivable and accounts payable 
our investing activities  other than purchases  sales and maturities of marketable securities  have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures and net purchases of long term investments 
capital expenditures for the years ended december   and  were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures decreased in due to reduced operational needs given our exit of custom genomics product lines  partially offset by increased spending on our therapeutic discovery and development efforts 
capital expenditures decreased in from due to lower spending on computer equipment  laboratory equipment and minimal spending on leasehold improvements in cash used for long term investments in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in we sold a strategic equity investment  resulting in proceeds of million and a gain of million  and diadexus repaid its million note to us 
in  we paid million  net of cash received  in connection with the acquisition of proteome 
in the future  net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of strategic equity investments  acquisitions  including possible earn out payments to former maxia stockholders  capital expenditures and maturities sales and purchases of marketable securities 
net cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to amounts paid to repurchase shares of our common stock and to repurchase convertible subordinated notes  offset by proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
in october  we announced that our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions 
through december   we had purchased  and retired   shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  offset by amounts paid to repurchase convertible subordinated notes 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to our raising of additional funds in two financing transactions 
in february  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due in a private placement  resulting in net proceeds of million 
also in february  we issued  shares of our common stock in a private placement  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
net proceeds from the sale of those shares were million 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years over years convertible subordinated debt interest on convertible subordinated debt non cancelable operating lease obligations total contractual obligations we also have purchase commitments of million at december   the timing of which is dependent upon provision by the vendor of products or services 
additionally  we have committed to purchase equity in certain companies when certain events occur 
the total amount committed at december  was million 
these commitments are considered contingent commitments as a future event must occur in order to cause the commitment to be enforceable 
we expect to use net cash in as we invest in our therapeutic discovery and development programs  including continued expansion of our laboratory facilities  continue to invest in our intellectual property portfolio  make payments related to our restructuring programs  continue to seek access to technologies through investments  research and development and new alliances  license agreements and or acquisitions  make strategic investments  and continue to make improvements in existing facilities 
we believe that our existing resources will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including our ability to attract and retain collaborators for our databases and other products and services  expenditures in connection with alliances  license agreements and acquisitions of and investments in complementary technologies and businesses  expenditures in connection with our expansion of therapeutic discovery and development programs  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  capital expenditures required to expand our facilities  including facilities for our expanding therapeutic discovery and development programs  and costs associated with the integration of new operations assumed through mergers and acquisitions 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources 
in february  we completed our acquisition of maxia 
the former stockholders of maxia received  in the aggregate  approximately  shares of our common stock and approximately  in cash upon the consummation of the merger 
we also assumed outstanding third party indebtedness of approximately  million in cash and  shares of our common stock was paid to certain debt holders of maxia 
the cash portion of the purchase price was provided from our existing cash balances 
in addition  upon the consummation of the merger  all outstanding shares of maxia series a additional payments  maxia series b additional payments  maxia series c additional payments and maxia common additional payments were converted  in the aggregate  into the right to receive up to  shares of our common stock and  in cash on the second anniversary of the consummation of the merger  and up to  shares of our common stock and  in cash on the third anniversary of the consummation of the merger 
further  all outstanding shares of maxia series a earn out  maxia series b earn out  maxia series c earn out and maxia common earn out were converted  in the aggregate  into the right to receive certain earn out amounts of up to a potential aggregate amount of million upon the occurrence of certain milestones set forth in the merger agreement 
twenty percent of each earn out payment  if earned  will be paid in cash and the remaining eighty percent will be paid in shares of our common stock such that an aggregate of million in cash and million in our common stock could potentially be paid pursuant to the earn out milestones 
the milestones occur as maxia products enter various stages of human clinical trials and may be earned at any time prior to the tenth anniversary of the consummation of the merger 
prior to entering into the merger agreement  in august  we loaned maxia million in exchange for the right to negotiate with maxia exclusively regarding an acquisition or other strategic transaction 
in exchange for the loan  maxia issued a million senior convertible note to us 
interest on the note would have accrued at the rate of per year in the event the negotiations with maxia had terminated 
the note was convertible into shares of any class or series of maxia capital stock at a set conversion price 
this note was applied as a portion of the consideration in the transaction 
in addition  we loaned maxia an aggregate of million to cover their operating expenses during the period between the signing of the merger agreement and the consummation of the merger 
in exchange for the loan  maxia issued to us a second senior convertible note 
through december   we had funded million under this note  which was charged to research and development expense 
factors that may affect results risks relating to our financial results we have had only limited periods of profitability  we expect to incur losses in the future and we may not return to profitability 
we had net losses from inception in through and in through because of those losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we intend to continue to spend significant amounts on new product and technology development  including the expansion of our research and development efforts for therapeutic discovery and development  the determination of the sequence of genes and the filing of patent applications regarding those gene sequences  the determination of gene functions  and our research and development alliances 
as a result  we expect to incur losses in we expect to report net losses in future periods as well 
we expect that any cash flows from our information products  including our database products and our intellectual property licensing  will be more than offset by expenditures for our therapeutic discovery and development efforts 
we anticipate that these efforts will increase as we focus on the studies that are required before we can sell  or license to a third party  a drug product 
the development of therapeutic products will require significant expenses for research  development  testing and regulatory approvals 
unless we generate significant revenues to pay these costs  we will not return to profitability 
we cannot be certain whether or when we will again become profitable because of the significant uncertainties relating to our ability to generate commercially successful drug products that will generate significant revenues 
our operating results are difficult to predict  which may cause our stock price to decline and result in losses to investors 
our operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period  which may cause our stock price to decline and result in losses to investors 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include changes in the demand for our products  the timing of intellectual property licenses that we may grant  the introduction of competitive databases or services  including databases of publicly available  or public domain  genetic information  the nature  pricing and timing of products and services provided to our collaborators  our ability to compete effectively in our therapeutic discovery and development efforts against competitors that have greater financial or other resources or drug candidates that are in further stages of development  acquisition  licensing and other costs related to the expansion of our operations  including operating losses of acquired businesses  losses and expenses related to our investments  our ability to attract and retain key personnel  regulatory developments or changes in public perceptions relating to the use of genetic information and the diagnosis and treatment of disease based on genetic information  regulatory actions and changes related to the development of drugs  changes in intellectual property laws that affect our rights in genetic information that we license  payments of milestones  license fees or research payments under the terms of our external alliances and collaborations and our ability to monitor and enforce such payments  and expenses related to  and the results of  litigation and other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights  including the lawsuits filed by invitrogen and counterclaims filed by us 
we anticipate significant fixed expenses  due in part to our expansion of our therapeutic discovery and development programs  and our continuing investment in product development and extensive support for our database collaborators 
we may be unable to adjust our expenditures if revenues in a particular period fail to meet our expectations  which would harm our operating results for that period 
forecasting operating and integration expenses for acquired businesses may be particularly difficult  especially where the acquired business focuses on technologies that do not have an established market 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as an indication of our future performance 
if our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price will likely fall  possibly by a significant amount 
in addition  if market or other economic conditions impact the stock market generally  or impact other companies in our industry  our stock price may also decline  possibly significantly 
if our strategic investments incur losses or charges  our earnings may decline or our losses may increase 
we make strategic investments in entities that complement our business 
these investments may often be made in securities lacking a public trading market or subject to trading restrictions  either of which increases our risk and reduces the liquidity of our investment  require us to record losses and expenses related to our ownership interest  require us to record charges related to the impairment in the value of the securities underlying our investment  require us to record acquisition related charges  such as in process research and development  require us to record charges related to post acquisition impairment in the value of the acquired assets  such as goodwill or intangibles  and require us to invest greater amounts than anticipated or to devote substantial management time to the management of research and development or other relationships 
the market values of many of these investments can fluctuate significantly 
we evaluate our long term equity investments for impairment of their values on a quarterly basis 
the volatility of the equity markets and the uncertainty of the biotechnology industry may result in fluctuations in the value of our investments in public companies 
the value of our investments in private companies can also fluctuate significantly 
current market conditions may cause us to write down the value of our private company investments 
many private companies are encountering difficulties in raising capital in the current market  and even if they are successful  subsequent rounds of financing are often at lower valuations than previous rounds 
impairment could result in future charges to our earnings 
our strategic investments may cause our earnings to decline or our losses to increase 
our debt investments are impacted by the financial viability of the underlying companies 
we have a diversified portfolio of investments 
the ability for our debt investments to be repaid upon maturity or to have a viable resale market is dependent  in part  on the financial success of the underlying company 
should the underlying company suffer significant financial difficulty  the debt instrument could either be downgraded or  in the worst case  our investment could be worthless 
this would result in our losing the cash value of the investment and incurring a charge to our statement of operations 
because our sales cycle is lengthy  we may spend a lot of time and money trying to obtain new or renewed subscriptions to our products but may be unsuccessful  which could hurt our profitability 
our ability to obtain new customers for information products  to enter into license agreements for our intellectual property or to obtain renewals or additions to existing database product subscriptions  depends upon prospective subscribers perceptions that our products and services can help accelerate their drug discovery efforts 
our database and licensing sales cycle is typically lengthy because we need to educate our potential subscribers and sell the benefits of our products to a variety of constituencies within potential subscriber companies 
in addition  each agreement involves the negotiation of unique terms  and we may expend substantial funds and management effort with no assurance that a new  renewed or expanded agreement will result 
these expenditures  without increased revenues  will negatively impact our profitability 
consolidations of pharmaceutical companies involved in drug discovery and development as well as expenditure reductions and an increased focus by our current or potential subscribers on later stage development programs and clinical compounds have affected the timing  progress and relative success of our sales efforts 
we expect that any future consolidations and reductions in research budgets will have similar effects 
in addition  current or prospective subscribers may perceive us to be in competition with them given our therapeutic discovery and development efforts  which may adversely impact new sales or renewals 
we have a large amount of debt and our debt service obligations may prevent us from taking actions that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests 
as of december   we had total consolidated debt of million  stockholders equity of million  and a deficiency of earnings available to cover fixed charges of million for the year ended december  a variety of uncertainties and contingencies will affect our future performance  many of which are beyond our control 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow in the future to enable us to meet our anticipated fixed charges  including our debt service requirements with respect to our convertible subordinated notes due that we sold in february at december   million face value of those notes were outstanding 
the following table shows  as of december   the aggregate amount of our interest payments due in each of the next five calendar years listed year aggregate interest our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences for our future operations  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  or placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 
the capital markets may not permit us to raise additional capital at the time that we require it 
we believe that we have sufficient capital to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  our future funding requirements will depend on many factors and we anticipate that  at some future point  we will need to raise additional capital to fund our business plan and research and development efforts on a going forward basis 
if we require additional capital at a time when investment in biotechnology companies such as ours  or in the marketplace generally  is limited due to the then prevailing market or other conditions  we may not be able to raise such funds at the time that we desire or any time thereafter 
additional factors which may affect our future funding requirements include any changes in the breadth of our research and development programs  the results of research and development  preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted by us or our future collaborative partners or licensees  if any  the acquisition or licensing of businesses  technologies or compounds  if any  our ability to maintain and establish new corporate relationships and research collaborations  competing technological and market developments  the amount of revenues generated from our business activities  the time and costs involved in filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent and intellectual property claims  the receipt of contingent licensing or milestone fees from our current or future collaborative and license arrangements  if established  and the timing of regulatory approvals 
risks relating to our business and industry our workforce reduction announced in november may have an adverse impact on our ability to deliver our information products on time  and we may fail to meet the expectations of our customers  which could in turn negatively impact our operating results 
in november  we announced a reduction of approximately of our workforce  including significant personnel reductions in our information product operations  in order to reduce expenses 
many factors  such as the reallocation of responsibilities among remaining personnel  the planned consolidation of our facilities and employee morale issues  may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in accordance with our current plans or customer expectations  cause delays in the delivery of our products  or lead us to change our information product plans  which in turn may have a negative impact on our revenues and customer relationships 
in addition  the implementation of the expense reduction program may itself result in customer concerns regarding our future performance and our ability to meet their expectations for our products  the diversion of efforts of our executive management team and other key employees  and higher than anticipated costs  any of which may negatively impact our operating results 
further  our management has announced that if our information products activities are not cash flow positive in  further expense reductions may be necessary which  in turn  may also have a negative impact on our operating results 
difficulties we may encounter managing the growth of our therapeutic discovery and development efforts may divert resources and limit our ability to successfully expand our business 
our anticipated growth in the future of our therapeutic discovery and development programs  and our establishment of those operations places a strain on our infrastructure 
as those operations expand  we expect that we will need to manage multiple locations and additional relationships with various collaborative partners  suppliers and other third parties 
to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to improve our operational controls  reporting systems and procedures 
we may not be able to successfully implement improvements to our systems and procedures in an efficient or timely manner 
in addition  we are currently exploring permanent locations on the east coast of the united states for our therapeutic discovery and development operations 
if we are unable to locate facilities on a timely basis  if at all  the growth of our therapeutic discovery and development operations may be adversely impacted 
our industry is intensely competitive  and if we do not compete effectively  our revenues may decline and our losses may increase 
we compete in markets that are new  intensely competitive  rapidly changing  and fragmented 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  human and other resources than we do 
if we cannot respond quickly to changing customer requirements  secure intellectual property positions  or adapt quickly and obtain access to new and emerging technologies  our revenues may decline and commercial opportunities for any of our drug products may be reduced or eliminated 
our competitors include applera corporation  gene logic inc  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and universities and other research institutions 
the human genome contains a finite number of genes 
our competitors may seek to identify  sequence and determine the biological function of numerous genes in order to obtain a proprietary position with respect to new genes 
in addition  we face competition from companies who are developing and may seek to develop new technologies for discovering the functions of genes  gene expression information  including microarray technologies  discovery of variations among genes and related technologies 
also  if we are unable to obtain the technology we currently use or new advanced technology on acceptable terms  but other companies are  we will be unable to compete 
we also face competition from providers of software 
a number of companies have announced their intent to develop and market software to assist pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers in managing and analyzing their own genomic data and publicly available data 
if pharmaceutical companies and researchers are able to manage their own genomic data  or find software solutions for managing genomic data that they find preferable to those provided by us and our collaborators  they may not subscribe to our databases 
extensive research efforts resulting in rapid technological progress characterize the genomics industry 
to remain competitive  we must continue to expand our databases  improve our software  and invest in new technologies 
new developments will probably continue  and discoveries by others  or the availability of such new discoveries in the public domain  may render our services and potential products noncompetitive 
we face significant competition for our therapeutic discovery and development efforts  and if we do not compete effectively  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
our therapeutic discovery and development efforts may target diseases and conditions that are already subject to existing therapies or that are subject to the drug discovery efforts of other entities 
these competitors may develop products more rapidly or successfully than we or our collaborators are able to do 
our competitors might develop drugs that are more effective or less costly than any that are being developed by us or that would render our products obsolete and noncompetitive 
in addition  our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly 
also  our competitors may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would limit our rights 
any drugs resulting from our research and development efforts  or from our joint efforts with any future collaborators  might not be able to compete successfully with competitors existing and future products or obtain regulatory approval in the united states or elsewhere 
we depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel  and the loss of the services of any of our key employees would affect our ability to achieve our objectives 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management  operations and scientific staff 
our product development  operations and marketing efforts could be delayed or curtailed if we lose the services of any of these people 
our future success also will depend in part on the continued service of our executive management team  key scientific  bioinformatics and management personnel and our ability to identify  hire  train and retain additional personnel for our therapeutic drug discovery and development programs 
we experience intense competition for qualified personnel 
if we are unable to continue to attract  train and retain these personnel  we may be unable to expand our business 
we rely on a small number of suppliers of certain products we need for our business and strategic collaborations with software providers for our information products  and if we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies  or maintain such strategic relationships  we will be unable to compete effectively 
currently  we use gene sequencing machines supplied by molecular dynamics  a subsidiary of amersham pharmacia biotech  ltd  and chemicals used in the sequencing process  called reagents  supplied by roche bioscience and amersham pharmacia biotech  ltd 
in our gene sequencing operations 
if we are not able to obtain an adequate supply of reagents or other materials at commercially reasonable rates  our ability to identify genes or genetic variations would be slower and more expensive 
in addition  we rely primarily on a strategic collaboration with one software provider to provide important functionality for our products 
if this collaborator suffers business difficulties  or provides functionality that does not satisfy our customers needs  or that our customers can find less expensively elsewhere  we may spend time and money to replace the functionality  we may not be able to deliver on customer commitments  and we may be otherwise adversely affected or our customer relationships and revenues may suffer 
if the information we obtain from third party data sources is corrupt or violates the law  our revenues and operating results could decline 
we rely on and include in our databases scientific and other data supplied by others  including publicly available information from sources such as the human genome project 
this data could contain errors or other defects  which could corrupt our databases 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that our data sources acquired this information in compliance with legal requirements 
if this data caused database corruption or violated legal requirements  we would be unable to sell subscriptions to our databases 
these lost sales would harm our revenue and operating results 
security risks in electronic commerce  unfavorable internet regulations  or business difficulties suffered by our collaborators may deter future use of our products  which could result in a loss of revenues 
we offer several products through our website on the internet and may offer additional products in the future 
our ability to provide secure transmissions of confidential information over the internet may limit online use of our products and services by our database collaborators as we may be limited by our inability to provide secure transmissions of confidential information over the internet 
advances in computer capabilities and new discoveries in the field of cryptography may compromise the security measures we use to protect our website  access to our databases  and transmissions to and from our website 
if our security measures are breached  our proprietary information or confidential information about our collaborators could be misappropriated 
also  a security breach could result in interruptions in our operations 
the security measures we adopt may not be sufficient to prevent breaches  and we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
further  if the security of our website  or the website of another company  is breached  our collaborators may no longer use the internet when the transmission of confidential information is involved 
for example  recent attacks by computer hackers on major e commerce websites and other internet service providers have heightened concerns regarding the security and reliability of the internet 
because of the growth in electronic commerce  the united states congress has held hearings on whether to further regulate providers of services and transactions in the electronic commerce market 
the federal government could enact laws  rules and regulations that would affect our business and operations 
individual states could also enact laws regulating the use of the internet 
if enacted  these federal and state laws  rules and regulations could require us to change our online business and operations  which could limit our growth and our development of our online products 
because our revenues are derived primarily from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  our revenues may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures 
we expect that our revenues in the foreseeable future will be derived primarily from products and services provided to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries as well as to the academic community 
accordingly  our success will depend in large part upon the success of the companies within these industries and their demand for our products and services 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by companies in these industries or by the academic community 
these reductions and delays may result from factors such as changes in economic conditions  consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  changes in the regulatory environment  including governmental pricing controls  affecting health care and health care providers  pricing pressures  market driven pressures on companies to consolidate and reduce costs  and other factors affecting research and development spending 
these factors are not within our control 
we are at the early stage of our therapeutic discovery and development efforts and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts 
we are in the early stage of building our therapeutic discovery and development operations 
our ability to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products based on proteins  antibodies and other compounds will depend on our ability to hire and retain key scientific employees  identify high quality therapeutic targets  identify potential therapeutic candidates  develop products internally  complete laboratory testing and human studies  obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property rights to our products  obtain and maintain necessary regulatory approvals related to the efficiency and safety of our products  enter into arrangements with third parties to provide services or manufacture our products on our behalf or develop efficient production facilities meeting all regulatory requirements  deploy sales and marketing resources effectively or enter into arrangements with third parties to provide these functions  lease facilities at reasonable rates to support our growth  and enter into arrangements with third parties to license and commercialize our products 
we have limited corporate experience with these activities and may not be successful in developing or commercializing drug products 
if we choose to outsource some of these activities  we may be unable to enter into outsourcing or licensing agreements on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  if we  in the future  elect to manufacture our products in our own manufacturing facilities  those facilities will require substantial additional capital resources  and we will need to attract and retain qualified personnel to build or lease or operate any such facilities 
the success of our therapeutic discovery and development efforts may depend on our ability to find collaborators or other service providers to leverage our capabilities  and if we are unable to establish future collaborations or if these future collaborations are unsuccessful  our research and development efforts could be negatively affected 
our strategy may depend in part upon the formation and sustainability of multiple collaborative arrangements and license agreements with third parties in the future 
we may rely on these arrangements for not only financial resources  but also for expertise or economies of scale that we expect to need in the future relating to clinical trials  manufacturing  sales and marketing  and for licenses to technology rights 
in order for any future collaboration efforts to be successful  we must first identify potential collaborators whose capabilities complement and integrate well with ours 
our collaborators may prove difficult to work with or less skilled than we originally expected 
it is likely that we will not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our future corporate collaborators devote to our programs or potential products 
we do not know whether our future collaborators  if any  might pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors  as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by collaborative arrangements with us 
conflicts also might arise with future collaborative partners concerning proprietary rights to particular compounds 
we might not be able to commercialize our therapeutic product candidates successfully  and we may spend significant time and money attempting to do so 
at the present time  we have only begun to identify potential therapeutic compounds and have yet to put them into clinical testing 
of the compounds we identify as potential therapeutic candidates  at most  only a few are statistically likely to lead to successful therapeutic development efforts 
we expect drugs that result from our research will not be commercially available for a number of years  if at all 
commercialization of any product candidates that we identify and develop depends on successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials 
preclinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes  and we do not know whether we  or any of our future collaborators  will be permitted to undertake clinical trials of any potential products 
it may take us or any of our future collaborators several years to complete any such testing  and failure can occur at any stage of testing 
interim results of trial do not necessarily predict final results  and acceptable results in early trials may not be repeated in later trials 
data obtained from tests are susceptible to varying interpretation  which may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
regulatory authorities may refuse or delay approval as a result of many other factors  including changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry  including biotechnology companies  have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after achieving promising results in earlier trials 
moreover  if and when our products reach clinical trials  we  or our future collaborators  may decide to discontinue development of any or all of these products at any time for commercial  scientific or other reasons 
there is also a risk that competitors and third parties may develop similar or superior products or have proprietary rights that preclude us from ultimately marketing our products  as well as the potential risk that our products may not be accepted by the marketplace 
completion of clinical trials may take many years 
the length of time required varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product candidate 
our rate of commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors  including our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials  variability in the number and types of patients available for each study  difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment  resulting in incomplete data  unforeseen safety issues or side effects  poor or unanticipated effectiveness of products during the clinical trials  or government or regulatory delays 
an important element of our business strategy is entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties under which we license our therapeutic product candidates to those third parties for development and commercialization 
we face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators 
also  these arrangements are complex to negotiate and time consuming to document 
we may not be successful in our attempts to establish these arrangements 
the terms of any such arrangements that we establish may not be favorable to us 
further  any such arrangements may be unsuccessful 
we may encounter difficulties in integrating companies we acquire  and our operations and financial results could be harmed 
as part of our business strategy we acquire assets  technologies  compounds and businesses 
our past acquisitions  including our recent acquisition of maxia pharmaceuticals  inc  have involved  and our future acquisitions may involve risks such as the following we may be exposed to unknown liabilities of acquired companies  our acquisition and integration costs may be higher than we anticipated and may cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate  we may experience difficulty and expense in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  disrupting our business and diverting management s time and attention  we may be unable to integrate or complete the development and application of acquired technology  or compounds  we may experience difficulties in establishing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  our relationships with key customers of acquired businesses may be impaired  due to changes in management and ownership of the acquired businesses  we may be unable to retain key employees of the acquired businesses  we may incur amortization or impairment expenses if an acquisition results in significant goodwill or other intangible assets  or our stockholders may be diluted if we pay for the acquisition with equity securities 
in addition  if we acquire additional businesses that are not located near existing sites  we may experience more difficulty integrating and managing the acquired businesses operations 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we could face substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products 
the testing and marketing of medical products entails an inherent risk of product liability 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products 
although we intend to obtain product liability insurance  this insurance may be prohibitively expensive  or may not fully cover our potential liabilities 
our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop  alone or with our future collaborators 
we  or our future collaborators  might not be able to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if a natural disaster occurs  we may have to cease or limit our business operations 
we conduct our database and a significant portion of our other activities at our facilities in palo alto  california and san diego  california  which are in seismically active areas 
although we maintain business interruption insurance  we do not have and do not plan to obtain earthquake insurance 
a major catastrophe  such as an earthquake or other natural disaster  could result in a prolonged interruption of our business 
risks relating to customers and collaborators to generate significant revenues  we must obtain additional database customers and retain existing customers 
if we are unable to enter into additional agreements  or if our current database customers choose not to renew their agreements upon expiration or choose to renew their agreements at lower prices or for shorter durations  we may not generate additional revenues or maintain our current revenues 
our database revenues are also affected by the extent to which existing customers expand their agreements include our new database products and the extent to which existing customers reduce the number of products for which they subscribe  the impact of which will vary based upon our pricing of those products  as well as the pricing of new information product offerings 
if the market for genomic information continues to soften  we may be required to lower prices further or restructure our product offerings to continue to meet customer demands which  in turn  may adversely impact our revenues 
some of our database agreements require us to meet performance obligations  some or all of which we may not be successful in attaining 
a database customer can terminate its agreement before the end of its scheduled term if we breach the agreement and fail to cure the breach within a specified period 
in addition  it is likely that database revenues will decrease if we are successful in entering into co development arrangements with some of our current database subscribers to develop new therapeutic products 
licensing our gene related intellectual property may not contribute to revenues for several years  and may never result in revenues 
part of our strategy is to license to database customers and to some of our other customers our know how and patent rights associated with the genetic information in our proprietary databases  for use in the discovery and development of potential pharmaceutical  diagnostic or other products 
any potential product that is the subject of such a license will require several years of further development  clinical testing and regulatory approval before commercialization 
therefore  milestone or royalty payments from these collaborations may not contribute to revenues for several years  if at all 
if conflicts arise between our future collaborators or advisors and us  they may act in their self interest  which may be adverse to our interests or to the interests of our stockholders 
if conflicts arise between us and our future corporate collaborators or future scientific advisors  the other party may act in its self interest and not in the interest of our stockholders 
it is likely that many of our future collaborators will be conducting multiple product development efforts within each disease area that is the subject of the collaboration with us 
our future corporate collaborators may develop  either alone or with others  products in related fields that are competitive with the products or potential products that are the subject of these collaborations 
competing products  either developed by our future collaborators or to which our future collaborators have rights  may result in their withdrawal of support for our product candidates 
if we fail to enter into future collaborative arrangements or if these arrangements are unsuccessful  our business and operations would be negatively impacted 
we do not know if we will be able to establish collaborative arrangements  or whether any such future collaborative arrangements will ultimately be successful 
for example  there have been  and may continue to be  a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted  and may continue to result  in a reduced number of potential future corporate collaborators 
this consolidation may limit our ability to find partners who will work with us in developing and commercializing drugs 
if business combinations involving our existing corporate collaborators were to occur  the effect could be to diminish  terminate or cause delays in one or more of our corporate collaborations or agreements 
if we are unable to enter into collaborative arrangements or if those arrangements are unsuccessful  our research and development efforts could be negatively impacted and we may need to seek additional capital resources during times when those resources may not be available or are available on less favorable terms 
risks relating to intellectual property our database revenues could decline due to sequences becoming publicly available 
our competitors may discover and establish patent positions with respect to the genes in our databases 
our competitors and other entities who engage in gene discovery may make the results of their sequencing efforts publicly available 
currently  academic institutions and other laboratories participating in the human genome project make their gene sequence information available through a number of publicly available databases  including the genbank database 
the public availability of these discoveries or resulting patent positions covering substantial portions of the human genome could reduce the potential value of our databases to our collaborators 
public availability of sequences could also impair our ability to realize royalties or other revenue from any commercialized products based on genetic information made public prior to our patent filings 
we are involved in patent litigation  which if not resolved favorably  could require us to pay damages 
we are currently involved in patent litigation 
in october  invitrogen corporation filed an action against us in federal court  alleging infringement of three patents that relate to the use of reverse transcriptase with no rnase h activity in preparing complimentary dna from rna 
the complaint seeks unspecified money damages and injunctive relief 
in november  we filed our answers to invitrogen s patent infringement claims  and asserted seven counterclaims against invitrogen seeking declaratory relief with respect to the patents at issue  implied license  estoppel  laches  and patent misuse 
we are also seeking our fees  costs and expenses 
in november  we filed a complaint against invitrogen in federal court alleging infringement of of our patents relating to genes  rna amplification and gene expression  and methods of fabricating microarrays of biological samples 
the complaint seeks a permanent injunction enjoining invitrogen from further infringement of the patents at issue  damages for invitrogen s conduct  as well as our fees  costs  and interest 
we are further seeking triple damages from the infringement claim based on invitrogen s willful infringement of our patents 
in april  invitrogen filed answers to our patent infringement claims 
we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend the suit brought by invitrogen vigorously 
however  our defenses may be unsuccessful 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate the possible range of any loss or damages resulting from these suits and counterclaims due to uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome 
in addition  regardless of the outcome  we expect that the invitrogen litigation will result in future costs to us  which could be substantial 
further  there can be no assurance that any license that may be required as a result of this litigation will be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are subject to additional litigation and infringement claims  they could be costly and disrupt our business 
the technology that we use to develop our products  and the technology that we incorporate in our products  may be subject to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others 
the risk of this occurring will tend to increase as the genomics  biotechnology and software industries expand  more patents are issued and other companies attempt to discover genes and snps and engage in other genomic related businesses 
the success of our therapeutic discovery and development efforts will also depend  in part  on our ability to operate without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others 
as is typical in the genomics  biotechnology and software industries  we have received  and we will probably receive in the future  notices from third parties alleging patent infringement 
except for invitrogen  no third party has a current filed patent lawsuit against us 
we may  however  be involved in future lawsuits alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to assert claims of infringement  enforce our patents  protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
we may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits 
regardless of the outcome  litigation can be very costly and can divert management s efforts 
an adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us or our future collaborators to seek licenses to other parties patents or proprietary rights 
we or our future collaborators may also be restricted or prevented from manufacturing or selling our products and services 
further  we  or our future collaborators may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary information  which may result in its unauthorized use and a loss of revenue 
our business and competitive position depend upon our ability to protect our proprietary database information and software technology 
despite our efforts to protect this information and technology  unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
although our database subscription agreements require our subscribers to control access to our databases  policing unauthorized use of our databases and software may be difficult  both domestically and internationally 
we pursue a policy of having our employees  consultants and advisors execute proprietary information and invention agreements when they begin working for us 
however  these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate  and our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques  otherwise gain access to our proprietary information  or design around patents issued to us or our other intellectual property 
if the inventions described in our patent applications on full length or partial genes  proteins and antibodies are found to be unpatentable  our issued patents are not enforced or our patent applications conflict with patent applications filed by others  our revenues may decline 
one of our strategies is to file patent applications on what we believe to be novel full length and partial genes  proteins  antibodies and snps obtained through our efforts to discover the order  or sequence  of the molecules  or bases  of genes 
we have filed us patent applications in which we claimed partial genes 
we have also applied for patents in the us and other countries claiming full length genes associated with cells and tissues involved in our gene sequencing program 
we hold a number of issued us patents on full length genes  the proteins they encode and antibodies directed against them and one issued us patent claiming multiple partial genes 
while the united states patent and trademark office has issued patents covering full length genes  partial genes and snps  the patent and trademark office may choose to interpret new guidelines for the issuance of patents in a more restrictive manner in the future  which could affect the issuance of our pending patent applications 
we also do not know whether or how courts may enforce our issued patents  if that becomes necessary 
if a court finds these types of inventions to be unpatentable  or interprets them narrowly  the value of our patent portfolio and possibly our revenues could be diminished 
we believe that some of our patent applications claim genes and partial genes that may also be claimed in patent applications filed by others 
in some or all of these applications  a determination of priority of inventorship may need to be decided in an interference before the united states patent and trademark office  before a patent is issued 
if a full length or partial length genes for which we seek a patent is issued to one of our competitors  we may be unable to include that full length or partial length gene in a library of bioreagents 
this could result in a loss of revenues 
if the effective term of our patents is decreased due to changes in the united states patent laws or if we need to refile some of our patent applications  the value of our patent portfolio and the revenues we derive from it may be decreased 
the value of our patents depends in part on their duration 
a shorter period of patent protection could lessen the value of our rights under any patents that we obtain and may decrease the revenues we derive from our patents 
the us patent laws were amended in to change the term of patent protection from years from patent issuance to years from the earliest effective filing date of the application 
because the average time from filing to issuance of biotechnology applications is at least one year and may be more than three years depending on the subject matter  a year patent term from the filing date may result in substantially shorter patent protection 
also  we may need to refile some of our applications claiming large numbers of genes and  in these situations  the patent term will be measured from the date of the earliest priority application 
this would shorten our period of patent exclusivity and may decrease the revenues that we might obtain from the patents 
if patent application filing fees are significantly increased  our expenses related to intellectual property or our intellectual property strategy may be adversely affected 
our ability to license proprietary genes may be dependent on our ability to obtain patents 
we believe we have the largest commercial portfolio of issued united states patents covering human full length genes  the proteins they encode and the antibodies directed against them 
if legislation currently proposed by the united states patent and trademark office is adopted  fees associated with filing and prosecuting patent applications would increase significantly 
if such fees are significantly increased  we would incur higher expenses and our intellectual property strategy could be adversely affected 
international patent protection is particularly uncertain  and if we are involved in opposition proceedings in foreign countries  we may have to expend substantial sums and management resources 
biotechnology patent law outside the united states is even more uncertain than in the united states and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries 
further  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
we may participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our foreign patents or our competitors foreign patents  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts 
regulatory risks if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to develop and market products in the united states and foreign jurisdictions  we or our future collaborators might not be permitted to commercialize products from our research 
before commencing clinical trials in humans  we  or our future collaborators  will need to submit and receive approval from the fda of an investigational new drug application  or ind 
the regulatory process also requires preclinical testing 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review 
any failure to obtain regulatory approval could delay or prevent us from commercializing products 
due  in part  to the early stage of our drug candidate research and development process  we cannot predict whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any product we  or our future collaborators  hope to develop 
significant research and development efforts will be necessary before any products can be commercialized 
satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years  is dependent upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
if regulatory approval of a product is granted  this approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is demonstrated through clinical trials to be safe and efficacious 
we cannot ensure that any compound developed by us  alone or with others  will prove to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials and will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive marketing approval 
outside the united states  our ability  or that of our future collaborative partners  to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
this foreign regulatory approval process typically includes all of the risks associated with fda approval described above and may also include additional risks 
because our activities involve the use of hazardous materials  we may be subject to claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials that could be time consuming and costly 
our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste 
our operations produce hazardous waste products 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and waste products 
we may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials  and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research  development and production efforts 
future changes to environmental  health and safety laws could cause us to incur additional expense or restrict our operations 
in addition  our future collaborators may use hazardous materials in connection with our collaborative efforts 
to our knowledge  their work is performed in accordance with applicable biosafety regulations 
in the event of a lawsuit or investigation  however  we could be held responsible for any injury caused to persons or property by exposure to  or release of  these hazardous materials used by these parties 
further  we may be required to indemnify our collaborators against all damages and other liabilities arising out of our development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations
