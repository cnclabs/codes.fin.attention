item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations and trends for the future should be read together with selected financial data and our audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis regarding trends in our future financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  as more fully identified in forward looking statements and risk factors 
our actual future financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
overview our revenue is derived from three primary sources license fees and royalties from licensing our patented surface modification technologies to customers  the sale of reagent chemicals to licensees  stabilization products to the diagnostics industry and coated glass slides to the genomics market  and research and development fees generated on projects for commercial customers and government grants 
revenue should be expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors our customers success in selling medical devices incorporating our coating technologies  the timing of introductions of coated products by customers  the timing of introductions of coated products that compete with our customers  the number and size of development projects that are entered into  the number of new license agreements that are finalized  and the value of reagent chemicals sold to licensees 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are based in part on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following are the critical areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
royalty revenue is generated when a licensed customer sells products incorporating our technologies 
royalty revenue is recognized as our licensees report it to us  and payment is typically submitted concurrently with the report 
we recognize initial license fees over the term of the related agreement 
effective october   we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
as a result of adopting sab  we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to license fees recognized in prior years in the amount of  net of tax of  or 
per diluted share 
revenue related to a performance milestone is recognized upon the achievement of the milestone  as defined in the respective agreements 
revenue on sales of the company s products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
generally  these criteria are met at the time our product is shipped 
revenue for research and development is recorded as performance progresses under the applicable contract 
valuation of long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of long lived assets  such as property and equipment and our investment in novocell  inc if such events or circumstances were to indicate that the carrying amount of these assets would not be recoverable  we 
table of contents would estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges or other measure of fair value was less than the carrying amount of the assets  we would recognize an impairment loss 
investments 
investments consist principally of us government and government agency obligations and mortgage backed securities and are classified as available for sale 
available for sale investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from operations and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  except for other than temporary impairments  which are reported as a charge to current operations and result in a new cost basis for the investment 
results of operations years ended september  and revenue 
the company s total revenue was million in fiscal  an increase of over fiscal the revenue components were as follows increase increase dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal decrease decrease revenue royalties and license fees product sales development total revenue substantially all of the total revenue increase in fiscal reflects the growth in royalties and license fees 
the growth resulted primarily from the royalty obligations of cordis corporation on its cypher stent  an increase in minimum royalties from amersham plc on its coated glass slide  and a one time royalty payment of million on product sales by a single licensee recorded in the third quarter of on april   cordis received us food and drug administration fda approval to begin marketing its cypher stent in the us the cypher stent incorporates a proprietary surmodics coating that delivers a therapeutic drug that is designed to reduce the occurrence of restenosis in coronary artery lesions 
license fees totaled million in fiscal  up from  last year 
substantially all of the increase was attributable to a  milestone payment from amersham for a product that it introduced to the market during the third quarter of and a non performing license we cancelled in the first quarter of fiscal that resulted in the recognition of approximately  of deferred license fee revenue 
taking into account the one time nature of the cancelled license and the milestone payment  management expects current year license fee results to be a good indication of licensing activity for fiscal the uncertainty surrounding when the fda will grant approval for a drug eluting stent in competition with cordis cypher stent  from which a significant portion of our royalty revenue was derived in fiscal  and the subsequent dynamics that will play out in the us marketplace when a competing stent is available constrains management s ability to project with confidence how such competition will affect royalty revenue for fiscal product sales increased to million compared to million last year 
sales of reagent chemicals chemicals that we manufacture and sell to licensees for coating their medical devices made up million of product sales  up from million last year 
a substantial majority of product sales 
table of contents growth over fiscal reflects increased demand by cordis in support of their cypher stent manufacturing 
in addition  cordis purchased a substantial majority of reagents sold in fiscal management anticipates reduced reagent sales to cordis in fiscal as their manufacturing process becomes more efficient 
however  management expects cordis to continue to purchase a substantial percentage of the reagents sold in fiscal year  in addition to being a significant source of royalty revenue 
in fiscal  cordis corporation represented of our total revenue  up from in fiscal commercial development revenue decreased to million 
substantially all of the decrease results from a lower level of clinical coating work performed on the cypher stent project since cordis received fda approval 
despite this decrease  the cordis cypher stent project accounted for a substantial majority of the development work we performed during fiscal year however  when cordis results are excluded from both fiscal and  development revenue from work on all other customers increased over fiscal we continue to perform other development work for cordis and for other customers  but on a smaller scale because in many cases the projects are at earlier stages of development 
since the cordis cypher stent project accounted for a substantial majority of the development work we performed during fiscal year  but the product received fda approval in fiscal year  we expect total development revenue to decrease in fiscal as well 
product costs 
the company s product costs were million for fiscal  a slight decrease of  from the million recorded in fiscal overall product margins averaged  a significant increase from the margins in fiscal attributable in part to reduced scrap costs but mostly to the fact that higher margin reagent product sales constituted an even greater percentage of total product sales than in fiscal during fiscal and  we plan to move portions of our manufacturing operations to our newly completed manufacturing addition in bloomington  minnesota 
much of the activity related to the move will also revolve around qualifying the facility and newly installed equipment 
management anticipates increased reagent production costs while we optimize our manufacturing operations at the new location and until we can discontinue manufacturing activities at our eden prairie facility 
research and development expense 
research and development expense for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  compared with the same period in fiscal the change was primarily a result of compensation and benefits associated with technical personnel we added during the past year and increased depreciation and facilities expenses 
we moved segments of our research and development activities to a portion of the renovated bloomington facility early in fiscal year management expects research and development expenses to increase in as we complete more renovations and move additional research and development and manufacturing activity to the bloomington facility 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense was million for fiscal  an increase of  or  from fiscal the increase reflects higher promotional costs  increased compensation  benefits  and business travel related to marketing personnel added in the first quarter of fiscal and licensing costs 
management expects sales and marketing expenses to increase throughout fiscal  although at a lower rate of growth 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  over fiscal the increase was primarily a result of costs associated with contract negotiations and a increase in directors and officers insurance 

table of contents other income  net 
the company s other income was million for fiscal  an increase of  or  from fiscal interest earned on our investments decreased to million mostly because of lower yields 
income tax expense 
the company s income tax provision was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal the effective tax rate was in fiscal  a slight increase from in fiscal years ended september  and revenue 
the company s revenue was million in fiscal  an increase of over fiscal the revenue components were as follows increase increase dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal decrease decrease revenue royalties and license fees product sales development total revenue the revenue growth in fiscal was primarily because of strong increases in product sales and development revenue 
within product sales  reagent chemicals chemicals that we manufacture and sell to licensees for coating their medical devices increased over last year due mostly to increased demand by cordis corporation 
during fiscal  cordis began manufacturing stents utilizing a surmodics coating for sale in europe and in anticipation of us fda approval 
as cordis demand grew  internal manufacturing efficiencies were passed on to cordis in the form of lower reagent prices 
cordis also largely influenced the growth in development revenue 
cordis represented a significant majority of the company s development revenue as we coated stents in support of their various clinical trials and performed other development projects 
additionally  cordis corporation represented of the company s total revenue in fiscal  up from in fiscal overall royalties and license fees decreased 
within this category  royalty revenue from coatings licenses ended the year above fiscal revenue from license fees declined to  in fiscal from nearly million in fiscal included in fiscal results was a million milestone payment from motorola life sciences motorola life sciences was sold to amersham plc during fiscal 
no similar milestone payment was received in excluding this payment  license fee revenue would have ended fiscal down 
finally  diagnostic royalties decreased from fiscal revenue in the prior year included proceeds from patent infringement settlements that offset an overall trend of decreasing revenue 
the sole licensee of these diagnostic patents has been subject to regulatory issues that have prevented it from manufacturing certain royalty generating products resulting in decreased revenue 
product costs 
the company s product costs were million for fiscal  an increase of  or  from fiscal overall product margins averaged  a significant increase from the margins in fiscal the significant increase in relatively higher margin reagent sales boosted overall product margins despite a slight decrease in margins from stabilization and slide products 

table of contents research and development expense 
research and development expense was million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from fiscal most of this increase was because of compensation and benefit expenses associated with the technical personnel hired by the company during the last two years 
in addition  the company incurred increased depreciation related to new equipment purchased during the same time period 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense was million for fiscal  a decrease of  or  from fiscal increased recruiting costs were partially offset by a decrease in business travel and promotional expense 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  over fiscal the increase was primarily because of operating costs associated with the bloomington property acquired in early while the property was undergoing improvements  the holding cost was allocated to corporate general and administrative expense 
the balance of the increase was attributed to higher bonus expenses  benefit costs  employer taxes on stock option exercises and increased professional fees and legal costs 
other income  net 
the company s other income was million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal interest earned on the company s investments decreased to million 
approximately  of the decrease was due to lower yields and smaller investment balances related to capital expenditures made during the year 
the remaining decrease was the result of lower capital gains on investment sales 
in fiscal  the company sold investments to generate  of gains to utilize fully a tax capital loss carryforward before it expired 
income tax expense 
the company s income tax provision was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal the effective tax rate was in fiscal  a slight increase from in fiscal because the company entered a higher federal tax bracket and utilization of the capital loss carryforward discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company had working capital of million and cash  cash equivalents and investments marketable securities totaling million 
the company generated positive cash flows from operating activities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase in cash flows in fiscal primarily reflects the increased net income generated during the year  with the accrued income tax provision more than offsetting a decrease in the income tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options 
during the last several years  a significant source of cash provided by operating activities included the result of income tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options 
management expects the impact of income tax benefits from option exercise activity to be less significant in fiscal  therefore management expects the cash outlay for income taxes to increase next year 
in october  the company purchased a facility in bloomington  minnesota  situated on acres of land  for approximately million and expended an additional million throughout fiscal on capital improvements 
during fiscal  the company invested approximately million to construct additional manufacturing capacity at this location 
with construction completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company intends to move its reagent manufacturing to the bloomington site from its current location in eden prairie  minnesota over the next twelve to eighteen months 
during 
table of contents fiscal  with the planned expansion into the bloomington facility  the company sold property located in orono  minnesota  for million 
terms of the sale included a  cash down payment and a note for million 
the note receivable was paid in its entirety on october  in the first quarter of fiscal  the company invested million in novocell  inc  a privately held irvine  california based biotech firm that is developing a potential treatment for diabetes 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company invested an additional  in novocell 
the total million investment  which is accounted for under the cost basis  is included in other assets and represents an ownership interest of less than 
information with respect to our general investment policies regarding debt and certain securities with debt features is located in item a of this report 
as of september   the company had no debt  nor did it have any credit agreements 
the company believes that its existing capital resources will be adequate to fund its operations into the foreseeable future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment policy generally requires investments with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
our investments principally consist of us government and government agency obligations and investment grade  interest bearing corporate debt securities with varying maturity dates  the majority of which are five years or less 
because of the credit criteria of our investment policies  the primary market risk associated with these investments is interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our available for sale securities as of september   but no material impact on the results of operations or cash flows 
management believes that a reasonable change in raw material prices would not have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows because our inventory exposure is not material 
although we conduct business in foreign countries  our international operations consist primarily of sales of reagent and stabilization chemicals 
additionally  all sales transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not expect to be subject to material foreign currency risk with respect to future costs or cash flows from our foreign sales 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
