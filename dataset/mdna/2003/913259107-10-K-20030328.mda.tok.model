item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview unitil corporation unitil or the company is nearing the completion of an unprecedented restructuring process brought about by the deregulation of the natural gas and electric industries in new hampshire and massachusetts 
as a result  by the middle of  the company expects to have divested its entire generation and power supply portfolio  thus transforming the company s vertically integrated utility operations into principally a pipes and wires business providing gas and electric delivery services 
in the process  unitil s distribution subsidiaries secured regulatory approval for the recovery of approximately a quarter billion dollars for all power supply related stranded costs  implemented comprehensive customer and financial information systems to accommodate the transition to competitive energy markets  and adjusted all utility delivery rates to reflect the overall cost of service as a restructured gas and electric energy delivery company 
during this restructuring process  management s focus has been to ensure fair and reasonable treatment of the investments made to meet the needs of unitil s customers  while at the same time making sure that the company is properly structured from both a financial and an operational perspective to continue to provide high quality and competitively priced electric and gas delivery services 
highlights of year on january   the company s new hampshire electric utility subsidiaries concord electric company ceco  exeter hampton electric company e h and unitil power corp 
unitil power filed a comprehensive electric restructuring proposal with the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc 
this proposal included the introduction of customer choice  the divestiture of unitil power s power supply portfolio  the recovery of stranded costs  the combination of ceco and e h into a single electric distribution utility  and new distribution rates for the combined entity 
on october   the nhpuc approved a multi party settlement on all the major issues in the proceeding 
a key result of the new hampshire restructuring settlement was the formation of unitil energy systems  inc ues on december  ues is the new hampshire distribution electric utility formed by the combination of ceco and e h  and is a wholly owned subsidiary of unitil 
ues received an increase of approximately million in annual distribution revenue to cover current operating costs  depreciation and amortization  and investments in utility plant 
these rates became effective december  on may   the company s massachusetts distribution utility subsidiary  fitchburg gas and electric light company fg e  filed revised rates with the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy mdte designed to increase annual base distribution revenues for both electric and gas operations to cover increases in operating expenses  depreciation and the cost of invested capital 
on december   the mdte authorized base rate changes to increase annual distribution revenues by million for electric operations and million for gas operations 
in addition  increases for rising gas supply costs were incorporated into the final gas rates  effective december  on october   the mdte issued an order approving a settlement agreement that resolved and secured the recovery of fg e s restructuring related stranded costs 
the settlement resolves issues concerning fg e s compliance with the massachusetts electric restructuring act of and related mdte orders 
under the settlement  fg e agreed to reduce the carrying charge on deferred transition costs and to pass along the benefit of lower interest costs to customers 
unitil eliminated a major environmental liability associated with a former electric generating station in fitchburg  massachusetts 
under a consent order voluntarily initiated by unitil with the us environmental protection agency epa  a remedial project to clean up and remove asbestos and related hazardous materials from a building formerly owned by the company is underway 
site remediation is expected to be completed at the end of funds from an insurance settlement related to this issue are believed to be sufficient to complete the remediation work  such that this matter will not have a material effect on the company s financial position 
in december  fg e and ues received regulatory approval to account for certain pension obligations as regulatory assets  avoiding a reduction in equity that would have been triggered by the substantial decline in the capital markets 
these regulatory orders do not pre approve the amount of pension expense to be recovered in future rates 
such recovery will be subject to review and approval in future rate proceedings 
unitil s non regulated business  usource  nearly doubled its revenues in  as its electric and gas energy brokerage business continues to expand into new regions where large commercial and industrial customers are able to choose their energy suppliers 
in december  unitil committed to a formal management transition and reorganization plan to streamline its management structure and to improve efficiency to meet ongoing business requirements 
the company estimates this reorganization will result in an annual cash savings of approximately million in operating expenses and construction project overheads in future periods 
earnings per share earnings per share non recurring items  net of tax restructuring charge investment write down extraordinary item earnings before non recurring items earnings in were million  or per common share on a diluted basis  compared to million  or in results for both years included significant non recurring charges that affected earnings 
in the fourth quarter of  unitil recorded a non recurring restructuring charge of million  or per share  associated with the reorganization and reduction of management and administrative positions 
the company estimates that the result of this management restructuring process will be an annual cash savings in future periods of approximately million in operating expenses and construction project overheads 
in  as a result of industry restructuring related regulatory orders  unitil recognized an extraordinary item to reduce regulatory assets by million after tax  or per share 
unitil also recorded an investment write down of million after tax  or per share  to recognize a decrease in the fair value of a non utility energy technology investment 
unitil subsequently sold its remaining interest in this non utility investment in and realized million in cash 
as a result of this sale  the company will also realize approximately million in current tax refunds from the carryback of this capital loss 
this sale transaction did not have a material impact on unitil s operating results 
excluding the effect of these and non recurring items  comparable earnings per share were in and in this decrease in earnings was mainly the result of increases in certain operating expenses  including higher pension and health care costs  higher depreciation expense associated with increased investments in utility plant  and accelerated amortization of certain regulatory assets 
these impacts were partially offset by higher distribution base revenues

extraordinary item  net of tax in november  the massachusetts legislature enacted the massachusetts electric restructuring act of the restructuring act 
the restructuring act required all electric utilities to file a restructuring plan with the mdte by december  among other things  the restructuring act required all massachusetts electric utilities to sell all of their electric generation assets and to restructure their utility operations to provide direct retail access to their customers by all qualified generation suppliers 
the mdte conditionally approved fg e s restructuring plan the plan in february  and started an investigation and evidentiary hearings into fg e s proposed recovery of regulatory assets related to stranded generation asset costs and expenses related to the formulation and implementation of its plan 
in january  the mdte approved fg e s plan  which included provisions for the recovery of stranded costs through a transition charge in fg e s electric rates 
in september  fg e filed its first annual reconciliation of stranded generation asset costs and expenses and associated transition charge revenues and the mdte initiated a lengthy investigation and hearing process 
on october and   the mdte issued a series of regulatory orders in several pending cases involving fg e  including a final order on fg e s initial reconciliation filing 
those orders included the review and disposition of issues related to fg e s recovery of transition costs due to the restructuring of the electric industry in massachusetts  as well as certain costs associated with gas industry restructuring and preparation and litigation of performance based rate proceedings initiated by the mdte 
the orders determined the final treatment of regulatory assets that fg e had sought to recover from its massachusetts electric customers over a multi year transition period that began in as a result of the industry restructuring related orders  fg e recorded a non cash adjustment to regulatory assets of million  which resulted in the recognition of an extraordinary charge of million  net of taxes 
the company recognized the extraordinary charge of per share  as of september as a result of all of these orders  the company has been allowed recovery of its massachusetts industry restructuring transition costs  estimated at million after reconciliation  including the above market or stranded generation and power supply related costs via a non bypassable uniform transition charge 
fg e has been  and will continue to be  subject to annual mdte investigation and review in order to reconcile the costs and revenues associated with the collection of transition charges from its customers over the next eight to ten years 
capital requirements and liquidity unitil requires capital to fund the addition of property  plant and equipment to improve  protect  maintain and expand its electric and gas distribution systems and for working capital and other timing differences related to the collection of revenues in rates 
the capital necessary to meet these requirements is derived primarily from internally generated funds  which consist of cash flows from operating activities  excluding payments of dividends 
the company supplements internally generated funds  as needed  primarily through bank borrowings under unsecured short term bank lines 
as of december   the company had unsecured bank lines for short term debt in the aggregate amount of million with three banks 
the amount of short term borrowings that may be incurred by unitil and its subsidiaries is subject to periodic approval either by the securities and exchange commission sec under the public utility holding company act of act or by state regulators 
in  the company received sec authorization to allow unitil to incur total short term borrowings up to a maximum of million 
the company periodically repays its short term debt borrowings through the issuance of permanent long term debt financing 
the company expects to continue to be able to satisfy its external financing needs by issuing additional short term and long term debt 
the continued availability of these methods of financing will be dependent on many factors  including security market conditions  economic conditions  regulatory approvals and the level of the company s income and cash flow 
in addition to the significant contractual obligations listed in the table below  the company also provides limited guarantees on certain energy contracts entered into by its regulated subsidiary companies 
the company s policy is to limit these guarantees to two years or less 
as of december   there are million of guarantees outstanding and these guarantees extend through october  significant contractual obligations s total as of december  beyond long term debt     capital lease     power supply buyout ma      purchased power contract      gas supply contract     total contractual cash obligations      cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities decreased by million in  compared to  mainly due to changes in accrued revenues and accounts receivable and accounts payable related to energy costs 
there is an inherent ratemaking lag between the period when energy costs increase and the period when the company collects those higher energy costs from customers 
this timing difference is recorded as accrued revenue 
during the collection lag period  as occurred in  the company s cash flow is negatively impacted and additional working capital related short term borrowings are necessary 
the balance of the decrease in was due to higher working capital needs  principally resulting from year end timing differences on energy supply contract payments 
in  cash flows from operating activities increased by million compared to  mainly due to decreased accrued revenues and accounts receivable related to energy costs 
during  the company collected revenue from rate reconciling mechanisms for higher energy costs incurred in  and used this cash  in part  to pay down short term debt borrowings 
operating activities s cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased million in  compared to the prior year  primarily reflecting a million increase in capital expenditures on distribution system additions and improvements  offset by the receipt of million of proceeds from the sale of the company s ownership interest in its non utility investment 
in addition  in  unitil received million in proceeds from the sale of its interest in millstone nuclear generating station unit no 
millstone 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased approximately million in  primarily reflecting a million reduction in capital expenditures on distribution system additions and improvements  the receipt of million of proceeds from the sale of the company s ownership interest in millstone  and the reduction of unregulated investment activities 
capital expenditures are projected to increase in to approximately million  primarily reflecting increased expenditures for utility distribution system improvements 
investing activities s cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities increased by million in compared to this increase primarily reflects increased short term borrowings used to fund a significant portion of the company s additions to gas and electric plant and equipment  as well as increased working capital requirements associated with recoverable deferred charges relating to industry restructuring 
cash flows from financing activities decreased by million in compared to this decrease primarily reflects repayment of short and long term borrowings  offset by proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt 
during  three of the company s utility subsidiaries issued long term debt totaling million 
the proceeds were used to reduce short term debt aggregating million and to provide long term funding for a portion of its additions to gas and electric distribution plant and equipment 
as a result of rising and volatile wholesale gas and electric energy prices in and early  the company filed and obtained authorization from the sec under the act to increase its maximum short term borrowing level to million 
the company also negotiated with its banks to increase its lines of credit to meet its borrowing obligations 
the company periodically files rate adjustments to its reconciling cost recovery mechanisms to reflect changes in wholesale energy prices 
during the company raised million of additional common equity capital through the issuance of  shares of common stock in connection with the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan drp 
during  the company moved to open market purchases to meet its share issuance obligations under the drp 
as a result  the company did not issue new original shares of common stock in connection with the drp during  and does not anticipate doing so in in conjunction with the sec emergency orders of september and   which suspended the applicability of certain of the conditions contained in its rule b  the company implemented an interim common stock repurchase program 
under this program  in  the company repurchased  canceled and retired  shares of its outstanding common stock at a total cost of  the sec has since lifted its suspension of the aforementioned conditions and accordingly  the company s interim common stock repurchase program is no longer in effect 
unitil s annual common stock dividend in was per share 
this annual dividend resulted in a payout ratio of for the year  before the non recurring restructuring charge 
excluding the loss from non regulated operations  the payout ratio was based on utility operations  before the restructuring charge 
at its january meeting  the unitil board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend on the company s common stock of per share 
this quarterly dividend reflects the current annual dividend rate of per share 
financing activities s interest rate risk as discussed above  the company meets it external financing needs by issuing short term and long term debt 
the majority of the company s debt outstanding represents long term notes bearing fixed rates of interest 
changes in market interest rates do not affect interest expense resulting from these outstanding long term debt securities 
however  the company periodically repays its short term debt borrowings through the issuance of new long term debt securities 
changes in market interest rates may affect the interest rate and corresponding interest expense on any new long term debt securities issued by the company 
in addition  the company s short term debt borrowings bear a variable rate of interest 
as a result  changes in short term interest rates will increase or decrease the company s interest expense in future periods 
for example  if the company had an average amount of short term debt outstanding of million for the period of one year  a change in interest rates of would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately  the average interest rate on the company s short term borrowings was and during and  respectively 
market risk although until s utility operating companies are subject to commodity price risk as part of their traditional operations  the current regulatory framework within which these companies operate allows for full collection of purchased power and gas costs in rates 
consequently  there is limited commodity price risk after consideration of the related rate making 
regulatory matters the unitil companies are regulated by various federal and state agencies  including the sec  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  and state regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over public utilities  including the nhpuc and the mdte 
in recent years  there has been significant legislative and regulatory activity to restructure the utility industry in order to introduce greater competition in the supply and sale of electricity and gas  while continuing to regulate the distribution operations of unitil s utility operating subsidiaries 
unitil implemented the restructuring of its electric operations in massachusetts in and is implementing a restructuring settlement for its new hampshire electric operations that is expected to be on may  massachusetts electric operations restructuring beginning march   fg e implemented its restructuring plan under the massachusetts restructuring act 
fg e completed the divestiture of its entire regulated power supply business in in accordance with the restructuring plan 
all fg e distribution customers must pay a transition charge that provides for the recovery of costs associated with fg e s power portfolio which were stranded as a result of the divestiture of those assets 
the plant and regulatory asset balances that will be recovered through the transition charge have been approved by the mdte as part of fg e s annual reconciliation filings 
the restructuring act also requires fg e to obtain power for retail customers who choose not to buy energy from a competitive supplier through either standard offer service sos or default service 
fg e must provide sos through february at rate levels which guarantee rate reductions required by the restructuring act 
new distribution customers and customers no longer eligible for sos are eligible to receive default service at prices set periodically based on market solicitations as approved by regulators 
as of december   competitive suppliers were serving approximately of fg e s load  mainly for large industrial customers 
as a result of the restructuring and divestiture of fg e s entire generation and purchased power portfolio  fg e has accelerated the amortization of its stranded electric generation assets and its abandoned investment in seabrook station  a nuclear generating unit 
fg e earns an authorized rate of return on the unamortized balance of these regulatory assets 
in addition  as a result of the rate reduction and rate cap requirements of the restructuring act  fg e has been authorized to defer the recovery of a portion of its transition costs and sos costs 
these unrecovered amounts are also recorded as regulatory assets and earn authorized carrying charges until their subsequent recovery in future periods 
in  unitil s earnings derived from these generation related regulatory assets  including carrying charges earned on deferred transition costs and sos costs  represented approximately of net income 
the value of fg e s regulatory assets is approximately million at december   and is expected to be amortized and recovered over the next three to nine years 
earnings from this segment of fg e s utility business will continue to decline and ultimately cease 
fg e made a total of four reconciliation filings in   and rate adjustments were approved for effect during the subsequent year  subject to further investigation 
in october  the mdte issued a final order on fg e s reconciliation filing which determined the final treatment of regulatory assets attributable to stranded generation costs  purchased power costs  and related expenses for the  and future  reconciliation filings 
fg e s reconciliation filing  submitted on december   recast its rates from through in compliance with the mdte s final order on its filing 
on october   the mdte issued an order approving a settlement agreement regarding the company s filing 
under the approved settlement  fg e agreed to reduce the carrying charge on deferred transition costs that will be recovered from customers in future years 
this change does not affect current electric rates  but will reduce the total amount of transition costs  including carrying costs  in future years 
the mdte s october order and associated settlement resolve many of the issues which otherwise might have been contested in fg e s future reconciliation filings 
fg e submitted its reconciliation filing on december  rate adjustments were approved for effect on january   subject to investigation  resulting in a rate reduction of approximately for residential sos customers 
the reduction is due to a decrease in the sos fuel adjustment  which is not subject to the rate cap  and does not affect net income 
massachusetts gas operations restructuring following a three year state wide collaborative process on the unbundling  or separation  of discrete services offered by natural gas local distribution companies ldcs  the mdte approved regulations and tariffs for fg e and other ldcs to provide full customer choice effective november  the mdte ruled that ldcs would continue to have an obligation to provide gas supply and delivery services for a five year transition period  with a review after three years 
this review is expected to be initiated in late the mdte also required mandatory assignment of ldcs pipeline capacity to competitive marketers supplying customers during the transition period 
this mandatory capacity assignment protects ldcs from exposure to certain stranded gas supply costs during the transition period 
new hampshire restructuring on january   the company s new hampshire electric utility subsidiaries  ceco  e h and unitil power  filed a comprehensive restructuring proposal with the nhpuc 
this proposal included the introduction of customer choice consistent with new hampshire s electric utility industry restructuring law  the divestiture of unitil power s power supply portfolio  the recovery of stranded costs  the merger of ceco and e h into one distribution company and new distribution rates for the combined company 
on october   the nhpuc approved a multi party settlement on all major issues in the proceeding  including stranded cost recovery for purchased power contracts 
the company estimates that these recoverable stranded costs are approximately million and these were recorded as power supply buyout obligations and regulatory assets at december  under unitil s approved restructuring plan  unitil agreed to divest its existing power supply portfolio and conduct a solicitation for new power supplies from which to meet its ongoing transition and default service energy obligations 
on february   unitil filed for final nhpuc approval of the executed agreements resulting from these divestiture and solicitation processes  including final tariffs for stranded cost recovery and transition and default services 
the filing proposed a recovery period of approximately eight years for stranded costs 
the implementation of customer choice for ues customers is targeted for may  unitil s restructuring plan is also designed to resolve the pending litigation on this matter 
in june  unitil and other new hampshire utilities intervened as plaintiffs in a suit filed in us district court by northeast utilities affiliate public service company of new hampshire for protection from the nhpuc s final plan to restructure the new hampshire electric utility industry 
although the nhpuc found that ceco and e h were entitled to full interim stranded cost recovery  the nhpuc also made certain legal rulings  that  if implemented  could affect ues s long term ability to recover all of its stranded costs 
the unitil settlement  approved in october  otherwise resolves all of the issues in the federal court action 
upon the expiration of all periods of appeal with respect to the restructuring proceeding by the nhpuc thereto  ues will implement retail choice and unitil will withdraw its intervention in this federal court action  with prejudice 
wholesale power market restructuring unitil has also been a participant in the restructuring of the wholesale power market and transmission system in new england  which is subject to ferc jurisdiction 
new wholesale markets structured pursuant to ferc s standard market design are expected to be implemented in the new england power pool during the first half of under the general supervision of an independent system operator and the regulatory oversight of the ferc 
rate proceedings prior to  the last formal regulatory filings initiated by the company to increase base rates for unitil s retail electric operating subsidiaries occurred in for ceco  for fg e  and for e h 
the last distribution base rate increase request for fg e s retail gas operations occurred in in  fg e s electric base rates were investigated by the mdte  which resulted in an electric base rate decrease 
a majority of the company s electric and gas operating revenues are collected under various periodic rate adjustment mechanisms including fuel  purchased power  energy efficiency  and restructuring related cost recovery mechanisms 
industry restructuring will continue to change the methods of how certain costs are recovered through the company s regulated rates and tariffs 
on the gas side  fg e continues to provide a multi year refund through its cost of gas adjustment clause in compliance with the mdte s may order finding that fg e had over collected fuel inventory finance charges 
at december   the unamortized balance of this refund was million 
fg e believes a refund is not justified or warranted and has appealed the mdte s ruling to the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc 
on a preliminary motion  a single justice of the sjc declined to stay the mdte s order based on a finding that refunds made by fg e may be recouped if fg e prevails on the merits of its claims 
the review of the mdte order by the sjc is pending 
on october   as part of the electric restructuring settlement for unitil s new hampshire utility operations described above  the company received approval from the nhpuc for an increase of approximately million in annual distribution revenues for ues  effective december  on december   the mdte issued an order resulting in distribution rate increases of million for fg e s electric operations and million for fg e s gas operations 
increases for rising gas costs were incorporated into the final gas rates 
fg e s new rates became effective on december  on april   fg e filed performance based regulation pbr plans with the mdte for both electric and gas operations 
pbr is a method of setting regulated distribution rates that provides incentives to control costs while maintaining a high level of service quality 
under pbr  a company s earnings are tied to performance targets  and penalties can be imposed for deterioration of service quality 
fg e s pbr plans were filed in conjunction with fg e s distribution rate filings  consistent with mdte policy to implement pbr in the context of base rate cases 
the mdte did not initiate investigations of the filings 
on january   the mdte issued orders closing the cases 
accordingly  fg e s pbr plans have no scheduled date of implementation  and conventional cost based regulation continues to apply 
in december  fg e and ues filed requests with their respective state regulatory commissions for approval of an accounting order to mitigate certain accounting requirements related to pension plan assets  which have been triggered by the substantial decline in the capital markets 
these requests were granted by the respective state regulatory commissions in december these approvals allow fg e and ues to treat the additional minimum pension liability and prepaid pension costs as regulatory assets and avoid the reduction in equity that would otherwise be required 
these regulatory orders do not pre approve the amount of pension expense to be recovered in future rates 
such recovery will be subject to review and approval in future rate proceedings 
based on these approvals  unitil has included the amount of the additional minimum pension liabilities and prepaid pension costs of million in regulatory assets on its balance sheet 
environmental matters the company s past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulations 
sawyer passway mgp site the company continues to work with environmental regulatory agencies to identify and assess environmental issues at the former manufactured gas plant mgp site at sawyer passway  located in fitchburg  massachusetts 
fg e proceeded with site remediation work as specified on the tier b permit issued by the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep  which allows the company to work towards temporary remediation of the site 
work performed in was associated with the five year review of the temporary solution submittal class c response action outcome under the massachusetts contingency plan that was filed for the site in completion of this work has confirmed the temporary solution status of the site for an additional five years 
a status of temporary closure requires fg e to monitor the site until a feasible permanent remediation alternative can be developed and completed 
since  fg e has recovered the environmental response costs incurred at this former mgp site pursuant to a mdte approved settlement agreement agreement 
the agreement allows fg e to amortize and recover from gas customers over succeeding seven year periods the environmental response costs incurred each year 
environmental response costs are defined to include liabilities related to manufactured gas sites  waste disposal sites or other sites onto which hazardous material may have migrated as a result of the operation or decommissioning of massachusetts gas manufacturing facilities from through in addition  any recovery that fg e receives from insurance or third parties with respect to environmental response costs  net of the unrecovered costs associated therewith  are split equally between fg e and its gas customers 
the total annual charge for such costs assessed to gas customers cannot exceed five percent of fg e s total revenue for firm gas sales during the preceding year 
costs in excess of five percent will be deferred for recovery in subsequent years 
former electric generating station the company is remediating environmental conditions at a former electric generating station located at sawyer passway  which fg e sold to wrw  a general partnership  in rockware international corporation rockware  an affiliate of wrw  acquired rights to the electric equipment in the building and intended to remove  recondition and sell this equipment 
during  rockware demolished several exterior walls of the generating station in order to facilitate removal of certain equipment 
the demolition of the walls and the removal of generating equipment resulted in damage to asbestos containing insulation materials inside the building  which had been intact and encapsulated at the time of the sale of the structure to wrw

those surveys revealed continued deterioration of the asbestos containing insulation materials in the building

critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies  which are defined as those policies where judgments or uncertainties could materially affect the application of those policies 
for a complete discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to the attached financial statements and note summary of significant accounting policies 
regulatory accounting the company is a regulated utility and its principal business is the distribution of electricity and natural gas 
accordingly  the company uses the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company has recorded regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities which will be recovered in future electric and gas retail rates 
the company also has commitments under long term contracts for the purchase of electricity from various suppliers 
the annual costs under these contracts are included in fuel and purchased power and gas purchased for resale in the consolidated statements of earnings and these costs are recoverable in current and future rates under various orders issued by state and federal regulators 
if the company  or a portion of its assets or operations  were to cease meeting the criteria for application of these accounting rules  accounting standards for businesses in general would become applicable and immediate recognition of any previously deferred costs  or a portion of deferred costs  would be required in the year in which the criteria are no longer met  if such deferred costs are not recoverable in the portion of the business that continues to meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
commitments and contingencies the company s accounting policy is to record and or disclose commitments and contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
for example  in the company resolved a long standing contingency related to an environmental matter by entering into a fixed price contract to remediate the site while also settling on the funding of the project to be provided by the company s insurance carrier 
as a result  management estimates that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position
