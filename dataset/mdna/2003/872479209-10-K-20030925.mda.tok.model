business tii network technologies  inc and subsidiary  formerly named tii industries  inc  collectively the company or tii  designs  produces and markets lightning and surge protection products  network interface devices nids  station electronic and other products 
the company has been a leading supplier of overvoltage surge protectors to us telephone operating companies telcos for over years 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments tii s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments 
the company believes that the determination of the carrying value of the company s inventories and long lived assets are the most critical areas where management s judgments and estimates most affect the company s reported results 
while the company believes its estimates are reasonable  misinterpretation of the conditions that effect the valuation of these assets could result in actual results varying from reported results  which are based on the company s estimates  assumptions and judgments as of the balance sheet date 
inventories are required to be stated at net realizable value at the lower of cost or market 
in establishing the appropriate inventory allowances  management assesses the ultimate recoverability of the inventory considering such factors as technological advancements in products as required by the company s customers  average selling prices for finished goods inventory  changes within the marketplace  quantities of inventory items on hand  historical usage or sales of each inventory item  forecasted usage or sales of inventory and general economic conditions 
the company reviews long lived assets  such as fixed assets to be held and used or disposed of  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
results of operations overview over the last several years  in response to the telecommunications industry wide slowdown  the company has restructured and downsized its operations to reduce its cost structure 
these actions enabled the company to operate profitably for the first quarter of fiscal however  during the second and third quarters of fiscal  the continuation of the telecommunications industry wide slowdown and a work slowdown at the company s principal customer were primarily responsible for a decline in sales from the first quarter levels resulting in losses for the second and third quarters 
in response to this sales decline  the company took additional steps to lower its cost structure  including a workforce reduction in the second quarter of fiscal the company s efforts to reduce its cost structure  together with increased sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulted in the company s return to profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company further downsized its puerto rico operations with the objective of creating a quick response  low cost assembly and specialty gas tube manufacturing operation and further expanded the company s outsourcing strategy 
these steps  together with the consolidation of certain functional departments and management responsibilities into the company s new york headquarters  resulted in additional workforce reductions and the reevaluation of the company s property  plant and equipment requirements  whereby the company retained only those assets consistent with this strategy 
management also reevaluated its home networking strategy and made the decision to discontinue the digital closet product line  which  despite receiving several industry awards  did not achieve expected results 
further  as a result of the continuing telecommunications industry wide slowdown  the company also reevaluated its inventories 
as a result  the company recorded charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million that consisted of million for the write down of inventories determined to be excess or obsolete  million for the impairment of long lived assets and million for severance and other costs 
in the third quarter of fiscal  as part of management s continuing strategy to improve profit margins by finding more cost effective alternative ways of producing its products  and also as a result of the successes under a fiscal re alignment plan  management committed to a plan to further re align its operations 
a key element of the plan was the expansion of the company s outsourcing strategy with contract manufacturers to produce a substantial portion of the remaining components and subassemblies that the company was still manufacturing 
included in this plan were workforce and production facility reductions  the write down of certain inventories and manufacturing machinery  equipment and leasehold improvements related to manufacturing activities conducted in puerto rico that were outsourced or were used for products that were eliminated  and other cost saving measures 
accordingly  during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a net re alignment of operations charge of approximately million  including an inventory write down of approximately million net of a reversal of a remaining allowance of  from a fiscal re alignment charge  million for the write down of net fixed assets  a charge of  for employee termination benefits for a workforce reduction of employees and  for a lease commitment for excess manufacturing space

 which became effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   applies to costs associated with an exit activity  including restructurings  or with a disposal of long lived assets 
those activities can include eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
sfas no 
requires that exit or disposal costs be recorded as an operating expense when the liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
commitment to an exit plan or a plan of disposal by itself will not meet the requirement for recognizing a liability and the related expense under sfas no 
sfas no 
grandfathers the accounting for liabilities that were previously recorded under eitf issue therefore  the accounting for the costs associated with the company s pre january  exit and disposal activities was unaffected upon adoption of sfas no 
the company had no exit or disposal activities that were initiated after december  in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as originally provided by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
additionally  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosure in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transitional requirements of sfas no 
are effective for all financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted the disclosure portion of this statement in the fiscal quarter ended march  the application of the disclosure portion of this standard had no impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the fasb recently indicated that it would require stock based employee compensation to be recorded as a charge to earnings beginning in in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify certain financial instruments as a liability or as an asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the company must adopt the provisions of sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have any impact on the company s financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
and applies immediately to any variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an interest is obtained after that date 
this interpretation is applicable to the company in the quarter ending september   for interests acquired in variable interest entities prior to february  this interpretation requires variable interest entities to be consolidated if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit an entity to finance its activities without support from other parties or the equity investors lack specified characteristics 
the company does not currently have any variable interest entities and  therefore  the adoption of fin will not affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates 
the interest payable under the company s credit facility is based on prime plus and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
historically  the effects of movements in the market interest rates have been immaterial to the consolidated operating results of the company 
the company requires foreign sales to be paid for in us currency and is billed by its contract manufacturers in us currency 
therefore  the company is not subject to foreign currency risk 
however  since the company s pacific rim suppliers are based principally in china  the cost of the company s products could be affected by changes in the valuation of the chinese yuan 
historically  the company has not purchased or entered into interest rate swaps or future  forward  option or other instruments designed to hedge against changes in interest rates  the price of materials it purchases or the value of foreign currencies
