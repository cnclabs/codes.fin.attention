item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company is a leading worldwide oil and gas drilling contractor  owning or operating a high quality  technologically advanced fleet of over marine and land drilling rigs 
the company s fleet currently includes floating rigs  cantilevered jackup rigs  land rigs and one platform rig 
in addition  the company or its affiliates operate platform rigs for third parties and it participates in a joint venture that operates two semisubmersible rigs for third parties 
the company provides offshore oil and gas contract drilling services to the oil and gas industry worldwide on a daily rate dayrate basis 
the company also provides offshore oil and gas drilling management services on either a dayrate or completed project  fixed price turnkey basis  as well as drilling engineering and drilling project management services  and it participates in oil and gas exploration and production activities 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
the following is a discussion of the company s most significant accounting policies as well as the use of estimates 
properties and depreciation rigs and drilling equipment 
capitalized costs of rigs and drilling equipment include all costs incurred in the acquisition of capital assets including allocations of interest costs incurred during periods that assets are under construction 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of property sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  resulting gains or losses are included in income 
jackup drilling rigs and semisubmersibles are depreciated over lives ranging from to years  with salvage values of million and million  respectively  per rig 
all land drilling rigs are depreciated over year lives with no salvage value 
drillships  with the exception of the glomar explorer  are depreciated over year lives  with salvage values of million per rig 
the glomar explorer is being depreciated over approximately years  which represents the time that remained on its year lease as of the date it entered service following its conversion to a drillship  with no salvage value 
the company reviews its long term assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
 among other things  requires that long lived assets and certain intangibles to be held and used be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value and establishes criteria to determine when a long lived asset is classified as available for sale 
assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to the company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
oil and gas properties 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development costs 
under this method of accounting  the company capitalizes all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of oil and gas properties and amortizes such costs  together with estimated future development and dismantlement costs  using the units of production method 
revenue recognition the company s contract drilling business provides crewed rigs to customers on a dayrate basis 
dayrate contracts can be for a specified period of time or the time required to drill a specified well or number of wells 
revenues and expenses from dayrate drilling operations  which are classified under contract drilling services  are recognized on a per day basis as the work progresses 
lump sum fees received as compensation for the cost of relocating drilling rigs from one major operating area to another  whether received up front or upon termination of the drilling contract  are recognized as earned  which is generally over the term of the related drilling contract 
the company also designs and executes specific offshore drilling or well completion programs for customers at fixed prices under short term turnkey contracts 
revenues and expenses from turnkey contracts  which are classified under drilling management services  are earned and recognized upon completion of each contract using the completed contract method of accounting 
income taxes the company is a cayman islands company 
the cayman islands does not impose corporate income taxes 
consequently  income taxes have been provided based on the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income taxes in these jurisdictions vary substantially 
the company s effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as the company s operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions 
the company s ability to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets requires that the company achieve certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of its net operating loss nol carryforwards 
the company has not provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of its us subsidiaries and their controlled foreign corporations us subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested 
should the company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of its us subsidiaries  the company would be required to record additional us deferred taxes 
in certain circumstances  management expects that  due to the changing demands of the offshore drilling markets  the company s mobile assets are more likely than not to be redeployed to other locations before those assets operate in certain jurisdictions long enough to give rise to future tax consequences 
as a result  no deferred tax liability has been recognized on the earnings from these assets 
in addition  the company has not provided for us deferred taxes on foreign earnings that could be taxed in the united states upon the occurrence of certain events in a future period 
the company plans  subject to approval by its board of directors  to implement a business restructuring that will better integrate the operations of the company 
this integration will change the us tax classification of certain of its subsidiaries before the occurrence of any events that could give rise to a tax liability 
should management s expectations change regarding the length of time a mobile asset will be operating in a given location  or should the company choose not to implement the planned business restructuring  the company would be required to record additional deferred taxes that could have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
goodwill the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company has defined reporting units within its contract drilling segment based upon economic and market characteristics of these units 
all of the goodwill recorded in connection with the merger has been allocated to the jackup drilling fleet reporting unit  as these rigs were the primary source of value in the merger discussions and negotiations 
the estimated fair value of this reporting unit for purposes of the company s annual goodwill impairment testing is based upon the present value of its estimated future net cash flows  utilizing a discount rate based upon the company s cost of capital 
stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock option and stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accordingly  the company computes compensation cost for each employee stock option granted as the amount by which the quoted market price of the company s common stock on the date of grant exceeds the amount the employee must pay to acquire the stock 
the amount of compensation cost  if any  is charged to income over the vesting period 
no compensation cost has been recognized for any of the company s outstanding stock options  all of which have exercise prices equal to the market price of the stock on the date of grant 
pension cost and other postretirement benefits the company s pension costs and liabilities are actuarially determined based on certain assumptions including expected long term rates of return on plan assets  rate of increase in future compensation levels and the discount rate used to compute future benefit obligations 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to compute pension cost was for  and the assumed rate of increase in future compensation levels was for and  and for the discount rate used to compute the projected benefit obligation was for  for and for the company s policy is to use a discount rate comparable to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the company s pension benefits 
actuarial gains and losses resulting from experience different from these assumptions or from changes in these assumptions are amortized over the remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans 
actual results could differ materially from estimated amounts 
for a discussion of the components of the company s net periodic pension cost and the funded status of the company s pension plans  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company had an unrecognized net actuarial loss of million 
this loss will be recognized in net periodic pension cost over the estimated remaining service lives of the active participants in the plans 
approximately million of this loss is expected to be recognized in the calculation of other postretirement benefits costs and liabilities includes the weighted average annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits 
these assumptions are based on data available to management at the time these assumptions are made 
actual results could differ materially from estimated amounts 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the period 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
key estimates used by management in this report include allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts based on analysis of historical collection activity 
factors that may affect this estimate include changes in the financial position of a major customer or significant changes in the prices of oil or natural gas 
depreciation and amortization 
the company depreciates its rigs and equipment over their remaining estimated useful lives 
the company s estimates of these remaining useful lives may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
tax estimates 
the company s ability to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets requires that the company achieve certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of its nol carryforwards 
the company has established a valuation allowance against the future tax benefit of a portion of its nol carryforwards and could be required to record an additional valuation allowance if market conditions deteriorate and future earnings are below  or are projected to be below  its current estimates 
turnkey drilling estimates 
the company typically relies on detailed cost estimates created by project engineering staff to compute and book profits on turnkey drilling projects based on known revenues 
these cost estimates are adjusted when final actual project costs have been determined  which may result in adjustments to previously recorded amounts 
accrued claims and liabilities 
the company estimates its accrued claims and liabilities based on the facts and circumstances specific to the claims and past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of litigated claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts 
fair values of financial instruments 
the company estimates the fair values of its financial instruments based on available third party market quotes for its financial instruments or market quotes based on financial instruments with similar characteristics 
where market quotes are unavailable  the company bases its estimates of fair values on the net present value of estimated future cash flows 
cash flow estimates 
the company s estimates of future cash flows are based on the most recent currently available market and operating data for the applicable asset or reporting unit at the time the estimate is made 
in addition to fair value calculations discussed above  cash flow estimates are also used to determine certain tax related valuations and for asset impairment analyses 
actual results could differ materially from these estimated amounts 
merger with santa fe international on november   global marine merged with a subsidiary of santa fe international and became a wholly owned subsidiary of santa fe international  which was renamed globalsantafe corporation at the time of the merger 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as the stockholders of global marine owned slightly over of globalsantafe after the merger  global marine was considered the acquiring entity for accounting purposes 
accordingly  the historical basis of global marine in its assets and liabilities has been carried forward to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the assets and liabilities of santa fe international were recorded at estimated fair market value at the date of the merger in the consolidated financial statements of the company  with the excess of the purchase price over the sum of such fair values recorded as goodwill 
in connection with the merger  the company implemented a restructuring program that included the consolidation of santa fe international s administrative office in dallas  texas  global marine s administrative office in lafayette  louisiana  and global marine s administrative office in houston  texas  into a single administrative office in houston  the consolidation of santa fe international s and global marine s north sea administrative offices in aberdeen  scotland and the separation of employees from the company 
the employee functions affected were primarily corporate support in nature and included accounting  information technology  and employee benefits  among others 
approximately of the affected positions were located in dallas  were located in houston and lafayette  and the remaining were located in aberdeen 
estimated restructuring costs associated with global marine were recorded as a pretax charge in the fourth quarter of changes in estimated costs  consisting mainly of refinements of cost estimates  and payments related to these restructuring costs for the year ended december   are summarized as follows office closures directors employee and consolidation separation and restructuring costs severance costs of facilities other costs total in millions houston and lafayette offices number of employees liability at changes in estimated costs payments liability at aberdeen office number of employees liability at changes in estimated costs payments liability at total number of employees liability at changes in estimated costs payments liability at the liability at december   included million of special termination costs related to certain retirement plans  which were included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
estimated costs associated with santa fe international s employee severance and closure of its dallas and aberdeen offices were recognized as a liability assumed in the purchase business combination and included in the cost of acquisition in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations 
changes in estimated costs  consisting primarily of costs associated with employee terminations and further employee relocation costs  and payments related to this liability for the year ended december   are summarized as follows office closures directors employee employee and consolidation separation and purchase price separation costs relocation costs of facilities other costs total in millions number of employees liability at changes in estimated costs payments liability at the liability at december   included million related to the dallas office lease obligation  which was included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the amounts in the above table  santa fe international paid million in to sfic holdings in consideration for sfic holdings consent to the merger 
this consent was required pursuant to an intercompany agreement with kuwait petroleum corporation and sfic holdings that required the consent of sfic holdings to  among other things  significant corporate actions by santa fe international  including the issuance of equity securities  sale of significant assets or a change in the corporate domicile of santa fe international or any of its subsidiaries 
operating results the company s operating results for represent the first full year of operations of the combined company  while the company s results of operations for include global marine s operations for the full year and santa fe international s operations from november  days 
the company s results of operations for represent the operations of global marine only 
as a result  year to year comparisons may not be meaningful 
in april  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus on issue  income statement characterization of reimbursement received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
the eitf consensus requires that all reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred be characterized as revenue in the income statement 
the company previously recorded certain reimbursements received from customers as a reduction of the related expenses incurred 
in connection with the implementation of the consensus on this issue  the company has reclassified certain reimbursements received from customers for the years ended december  and  as revenues and related operating expenses to conform to the presentation 
operating income and net income for all periods presented were not affected by this reclassification 
amounts classified as revenues and expenses for pursuant to this consensus and the amounts of revenues and expenses reclassified by segment for each prior period presented are as follows in millions year ended december  contract drilling drilling management services summary data relating to the company s operations by business segment follows increase increase decrease decrease in millions revenues contract drilling  drilling management oil and gas less intersegment revenues operating income contract drilling drilling management oil and gas restructuring costs corporate expenses operating income in increased by million to million from million in  due primarily to the inclusion of million attributable to the full year operations of the santa fe international drilling fleet 
excluding the contribution from the santa fe fleet  operating income decreased by million due primarily to lower dayrates and utilization in the us gulf of mexico  increases in repair and maintenance expenses  reduced turnkey drilling activity  lower average oil and gas prices and an increase in corporate expenses 
operating income for included million of transition expenses  which are costs incurred in connection with the merger and subsequent integration of global marine and santa fe international 
such costs are not considered to be indicative of the company s ongoing operations 
operating income for included a million charge in connection with a restructuring program related to the merger 
operating income in increased by million to million from million in approximately million of this increase was attributable to global marine s operating results  and million was attributable to santa fe international s operating results from the date of the merger 
the increase in global marine s operating income in as compared to was primarily attributable to the full year results of the glomar cr luigs and glomar jack ryan drillships  which were added to the company s fleet in april and december  respectively  along with increases in average dayrates and rig utilization 
these increases were offset in part by the million restructuring charge related to the merger noted above 
in august  the existing drilling contract for the glomar jack ryan ultra deepwater drillship was assigned by the company s customer to their australian subsidiary to drill a series of deepwater wells on the western and southern coasts of australia 
to facilitate the assignment of this contract  the company was paid million  which is being amortized over the remaining contract term expiring august  in february  the company sold the key bermuda jackup drilling rig to nabors drilling international limited for approximately million  less selling costs of approximately million 
the carrying value of the key bermuda was adjusted to its estimated market value in the consolidated financial statements of the company at the time of the merger and  therefore  no gain or loss was recorded as a result of this sale 
in june  the company completed the sale of the glomar beaufort sea i concrete island drilling system to exxon neftegas limited for million  resulting in a pretax gain in the amount of million 
pro forma financial information the following unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma results for the years ended december  and  has been prepared as if the merger had occurred on january  revenues for both periods have been reclassified pursuant to eitf issue discussed above 
if global marine and santa fe international had merged on this date  globalsantafe might have performed differently 
the pro forma financial information should not be relied on as an indication of the financial position or results of operations that the company would have achieved had the merger taken place at a different date or of the future results that the company will achieve 
year ended december  in millions  except per share data revenues   operating income income before income taxes net income earnings per ordinary share basic diluted the pro forma information includes adjustments for additional revenue based on the fair market value of certain drilling contracts acquired  elimination of goodwill amortization  additional depreciation based on the fair market value of drilling rigs and other property and equipment acquired and related adjustments for income taxes  reflecting the incremental benefit attributable to the effect of the company s tax structure on the earnings of the combined companies 
backlog the company s contract drilling backlog at december   totaled approximately billion  of which approximately million is expected to be realized in contract drilling backlog at december  was billion 
market conditions the drilling business has historically been cyclical  marked by periods of low demand  excess rig supply and low dayrates  followed by periods of high demand  short rig supply and increasing dayrates 
these cycles are highly volatile and are traditionally influenced by a number of factors  including oil and gas prices  the spending plans of the company s customers and the highly competitive nature of the offshore drilling industry 
even when rig markets appear to have stabilized at a certain level of utilization and dayrates  these markets can change swiftly  making it difficult to predict trends or conditions in the market 
the relocation of rigs from weak markets to stable or strong markets may also have a significant impact on utilization and dayrates in the affected markets 
a summary of current market conditions in the company s areas of operations follows north sea 
the company currently operates three semisubmersibles  five cantilevered heavy duty harsh environment jackups  three cantilevered jackups and a platform rig in the north sea market 
utilization and dayrates for both jackups and semisubmersibles have declined in this market following the announcement of tax law changes in the united kingdom  the recent period of reorganization and asset sales among our clients  and the reassessment of production targets by our clients 
the company expects continued weakness in this market and anticipates that several of its rigs currently under contract in this area will either continue to receive low dayrates  or be idle when their current contracts expire 
the company also expects jackup dayrates to soften in the first quarter of  and anticipates semisubmersible and jackup market weakness to continue throughout  likely resulting in intermittent periods of idle time for a portion of its rigs 
in the fourth quarter of  the company mobilized one of its semisubmersibles that had previously been operating in this market to a shipyard in poland for painting and other maintenance  after which it will be cold stacked in scotland 
us gulf of mexico 
the company currently operates two semisubmersibles and ten cantilevered jackups in the us gulf of mexico market  which is characterized by short term contracts 
although the us gulf of mexico jackup market has historically reacted to changes in natural gas prices  recent high natural gas prices have thus far had little effect on utilization  and this market is currently experiencing significant idle capacity for both jackups and semisubmersibles 
one of the company s semisubmersibles in this market is currently committed until june  and the other is operating under a contract that expires in the first quarter of dayrates for jackup rigs marginally improved during the first half of but have weakened slightly since that time 
despite this market weakness  the company s ten jackups in the us gulf of mexico experienced utilization in the fourth quarter of while generally maintaining market dayrates 
ultra deepwater drillship market 
the company currently operates three drillships in the ultra deepwater markets in the us gulf of mexico two units and australia one unit 
the worldwide ultra deepwater market is currently oversupplied  and the contracts of numerous units in this class worldwide are expected to expire in and there are presently fewer oil companies pursuing operations in ultra deepwater  and several oil companies with these types of rigs under contract have offered them to other oil companies at subsidized dayrates 
while the company s ultra deepwater drillships have been operating under long term contracts  one contract will expire in april  to be followed by a day contract at a significantly reduced dayrate  and the contracts of the other two drillships will expire in the third quarter of the company currently has no long term commitments for its drillships following these expirations 
west africa 
the company currently operates two semisubmersibles and nine cantilevered jackups in this market 
one of the company s semisubmersibles in this market is contracted through  while the other is contracted through a substantial portion of while jackup dayrates and utilization remained firm in this market throughout most of  recent jackup contract early terminations in nigeria and possible rig relocations into this market may cause dayrates and utilization to decline in the west africa market 
although the company is facing the potential for lower dayrates and utilization for its nine jackups  four of its jackups in this market are contracted through middle east and mediterranean 
the company currently operates six cantilevered jackups in the middle east region and two cantilevered jackups in the mediterranean region offshore north africa  with one additional cantilevered jackup being mobilized to the mediterranean 
although both markets appear to be stable  contracts on two of these rigs expire in the first quarter of and the current contract on an additional rig expires in the second quarter of the company s moored drillship is cold stacked in malta 
southeast asia 
the company currently operates six cantilevered jackups in southeast asia 
four of these jackups are contracted beyond the end of  with a fifth jackup rig contracted until the fourth quarter of the remaining jackup concluded a contract in the first quarter of and will undergo modifications and upgrades in a singapore shipyard  with no contract commitment thereafter 
although the market is generally balanced in this region and utilization remains high  the company has observed a reduction in dayrates in recent contract placements 
other 
in northeast canada  the company currently operates one semisubmersible and one heavy duty harsh environment jackup 
the semisubmersible is undergoing upgrades and modifications during the first quarter of prior to the mid commencement of a two year contract 
the jackup is under contract until the fourth quarter of in trinidad and tobago  the company currently operates one cantilevered jackup under a contract expiring in the second quarter of land drilling fleet 
the company owns land drilling rigs  with of these located in the middle east rig  located in the middle east  is held for sale  four in north africa and eight in venezuela 
all but three of the active rigs in the middle east were under contract at the start of  but the company anticipates that utilization and dayrates for the middle east and north africa land rig markets may experience some softening in the first and second quarters of in march  the company suspended drilling operations and evacuated its employees from kuwait in response to the threat of war in iraq 
although the suspension of drilling operations is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations for the first quarter of  the company estimates  based on current contracts and commitments  that its results of operations for each subsequent quarter will be negatively impacted by approximately per diluted ordinary share for each full quarter that operations are suspended 
should the threat of war continue  or if hostilities break out  the company may be forced to evacuate employees in other countries in the region  possibly resulting in the termination of some contracts 
venezuela has been experiencing labor strikes and demonstrations and in experienced an attempt to overthrow the government 
the implications and results of the political  economic and social instability in venezuela are uncertain at this time  but the instability has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on this market 
none of the company s land rigs located in venezuela are currently operating 
future market for newbuilds the gsf constellation i  the first of the company s two high performance jackups currently under construction  is scheduled for delivery during the second quarter of  while the gsf development driller i  the first of two ultra deepwater semisubmersibles also under construction  and the gsf constellation ii are scheduled for delivery around the end of the first quarter of although the company has options for construction of additional jackup and ultra deepwater semisubmersible units beyond these four  it does not intend to exercise these options 
the company s ability to obtain contracts for its newbuild rigs and the terms of such contracts will depend on market conditions at the time these rigs are available for contract 
the company is actively marketing the gsf constellation i and the gsf development driller i 
while the company believes that its newbuild rigs will have substantial advantages in efficiency and capability over competitive equipment in the industry  it can provide no assurance that it will be able to obtain contracts for all of its new rigs or that the contract terms will be similar to those for similar equipment in current market conditions

see note under item selected financial data 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  contract drilling revenues increased by million to  million in compared to million in due primarily to million from the addition of the santa fe international rigs to the company s drilling fleet  partially offset by lower dayrates and utilization in the us gulf of mexico 
for  and  respectively  the company s average offshore utilization for its drilling rigs in the us gulf of mexico was  and 
the average utilization for rigs located in the north sea was  and  respectively  for  and for the same periods  rigs located offshore west africa averaged  and  respectively  and rigs in south america averaged  and  respectively 
the company s utilization rate for averaged in southeast asia and in the middle east 
global marine s offshore fleet did not operate in southeast asia or the middle east during or the company s land drilling utilization rates averaged for and for the days in the company s operating profit margin for contract drilling operations decreased to in  from in due primarily to the addition of land drilling operations  which have historically operated at substantially lower margins than the company s offshore fleet  and lower average dayrates in the us gulf of mexico  along with an increase in depreciation expense due to the adjustment of the carrying values of the santa fe international rigs to their estimated market value in connection with the merger 
in addition  the company s contract drilling operating results for were impacted by accelerated repair and maintenance expenditures on several rigs that were relocating  undergoing upgrades or idle  as well as a painting and maintenance project on one of its semisubmersibles 
in accordance with its normal practice  the company is taking advantage of idle rig time in the north sea and elsewhere to perform repair  maintenance and upgrade work on several of its idle rigs  which will result in a continuation of this increased level of repair and maintenance costs in the first quarter of the company recorded approximately million of merger related transition expenses in its contract drilling operations during  which represent costs incurred as part of the integration of the operations of global marine and santa fe international 
such costs are not considered to be indicative of the company s ongoing operations 
along with the addition of the santa fe international drilling fleet  the mobilization of rigs between geographic areas also affected each area s revenues over the periods indicated 
subsequent to the merger  the company s mobilization of rigs was as follows one jackup from the us gulf of mexico to trinidad in december and back to the us gulf of mexico in august  one drillship from the us gulf of mexico to trinidad in march  back to the us gulf of mexico in may and to australia in september  one jackup from trinidad to the north sea in may  one jackup from trinidad to west africa in july  one semisubmersible from the north sea to the east coast of canada in july  and one jackup from the north sea to west africa in november prior to the merger  global marine mobilized one drillship from offshore peru to west africa in april  one drillship from west africa to the us gulf of mexico in june  one jackup from west africa to the us gulf of mexico in february  one drillship from trinidad to the us gulf of mexico in may  one semisubmersible from canada to the north sea in may  one jackup from the us gulf of mexico to west africa in july and one jackup from the us gulf of mexico to trinidad in september as of january   of the company s offshore drilling rigs were located in the us gulf of mexico  rigs  including its platform rig  were located in the north sea  were offshore west africa  six were in the middle east  six were in southeast asia  two were offshore north africa with one en route  two were off the northeast coast of canada  one was offshore trinidad and tobago  one was off the western coast of australia  one was cold stacked in malta and one was undergoing a painting and maintenance project in a shipyard in poland  after which it will be cold stacked in scotland 
as of january   of the company s land rigs were located in the middle east  eight were in south america and four were in north africa 
as of january   of the company s offshore rigs were either committed or under contract  and of the company s land rigs were under contract 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  contract drilling revenues increased by million in to million compared to million in approximately million of this increase was attributable to global marine s fleet  and million was attributable to santa fe international s fleet from the merger date 
of the million increase in global marine s contract drilling revenues in as compared to  million was attributable to the addition of the glomar cr luigs drillship in april and the glomar jack ryan drillship in december  million was attributable to an increase in average dayrates  million was attributable to an increase in average rig utilization and million was attributable to an increase in reimbursable revenues 
the increase in average dayrates in as compared to was primarily due to operations in west africa and the us gulf of mexico  and the increase in average rig utilization was primarily due to operations in west africa and the north sea 
of the million in contract drilling revenues attributable to santa fe international s fleet  million was attributable to marine rigs and million was attributable to land rigs 
operating income and operating margin increased to million and  respectively  for compared to million and  respectively  for operating expenses increased by million to million in from million in approximately million of this increase was attributable to global marine s fleet  and million was attributable to santa fe international s fleet from the merger date 
the increase in global marine s contract drilling operating expenses in as compared to was primarily due to higher operating costs in connection with the full year operations of the glomar cr luigs and the glomar jack ryan drillships  an increase in rig utilization and full year crewed operations of the gsf arctic ii formerly the maersk jutlander  which was being leased from the company under a bareboat charter for most of under this bareboat charter  the company provided the customer with the rig  and the customer used its own crews to operate the rig 
drilling management services year ended december   compared to year ended december  drilling management services revenues decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease in revenues consisted of a million decrease attributable to fewer turnkey projects completed  partly offset by a million increase attributable to higher average revenues per turnkey project and a million increase in daywork  reimbursable and other revenues 
the company completed turnkey projects in wells drilled and well completions as compared to turnkey projects in wells drilled and well completions 
drilling management services operating income decreased by million to million in from million in  and operating margin decreased to in from in these decreases were due primarily to the deferral of turnkey profit totaling million and million for and  respectively  related to wells in which cmi was either the operator or held a working interest 
excluding the deferral of this profit  drilling management services operating income increased by million to million for from million in  due primarily to improved turnkey drilling performance in as compared to the company incurred losses totaling million on five of the turnkey projects completed in compared to losses totaling million on of the turnkey projects completed in the company also recognized million of estimated losses in the fourth quarter of related to a well in progress at december   that the company completed at a loss in the first quarter of year ended december   compared to year ended december  drilling management services revenues decreased by million to million in from million in approximately million of this decrease was attributable to global marine s operations  offset by a million increase attributable to operations of santa fe international after the merger 
the decrease in global marine s revenues consisted of a million decrease attributable to a decrease in the number of turnkey projects  partly offset by a million increase attributable to higher average revenues per turnkey project and an million increase attributable to daywork  reimbursable and other revenues 
the company completed turnkey projects in wells drilled and well completions as compared to projects in wells drilled and well completions 
operating income for drilling management services increased by million to million in from million in  and operating profit margin increased to in from in of the million increase in drilling management services operating income for as compared to  million was attributable to global marine  and million was attributable to the operations of santa fe international from the merger date 
the increase in operating margin in as compared to was due in part to the company incurring fewer loss wells in as compared to the company incurred losses totaling million on of the turnkey projects in as compared to losses totaling million incurred on of the turnkey projects during also contributing to the increase in the company s operating margin in as compared to was a turnkey well drilled in the north sea in december the turnkey drilling contract guaranteed the company recovery of its turnkey drilling costs upon completion of the well and included a provision for additional revenue based on production from the well 
the company received million of additional revenue from this well in the fourth quarter of  all of which was operating profit 
results of operations from the company s drilling management services may be limited by certain factors  in particular the ability of the company to find and retain qualified personnel  to hire suitable rigs at acceptable rates  and to obtain and successfully perform turnkey drilling contracts based on competitive bids 
the company s ability to obtain turnkey drilling contracts is largely dependent on the number of such contracts available for bid  which in turn is influenced by market prices for oil and gas  among other factors 
accordingly  results of the company s drilling management service operations may vary widely from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
other income and expense general and administrative expenses increased to million in as compared to million in due primarily to increases in personnel from the inclusion of santa fe international operations as a result of the merger  transition expenses and an increase in pension expense 
transition expenses included in general and administrative expenses totaled approximately million in transition expenses for were not material 
transition expenses  which represent costs incurred as part of the integration of the operations of global marine and santa fe international  are not considered to be indicative of the company s ongoing operations 
pension expense included in general and administrative expenses increased to million in as compared to million in due primarily to the inclusion of expenses related to legacy santa fe international plans  lower returns on plan assets and plan changes to conform benefits under the legacy pension plans as a result of the merger 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in from million in approximately million of this increase was attributable to the operations of santa fe international after the merger  and million was attributable to global marine 
the increase in global marine s general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in information systems costs and professional fees  partly offset by lower compensation expense 
interest expense was million for  million for and million for interest expense was essentially flat in as compared to the decrease in interest expense from to reflects lower effective interest rates for the year due to the issuance of the zero coupon convertible debentures in june as well as lower average debt balances 
the company capitalized approximately million of interest costs in in connection with the company s rig expansion program discussed in liquidity and capital resources financing and investing activities 
the company capitalized interest costs of million in in connection with the construction of these rigs 
global marine capitalized interest costs of million in in connection with the construction of the glomar cr luigs and glomar jack ryan drillships 
interest income increased to million in from million in due to increased average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  primarily as a result of the merger  and cash generated from operations  offset in part by lower interest rates earned in on the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 
interest income increased to million in from million in primarily due to higher average cash balances and short term investments in as compared to in june  the company completed the sale of the glomar beaufort sea i concrete island drilling system to exxon neftegas limited for million  resulting in a pretax gain in the amount of million 
other income totaled million in  due primarily to net gains totaling million recorded on embedded derivative financial instruments associated with two year variable dayrate contracts for two of the company s cantilevered jackups 
see discussion in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
the net gains in were offset in part by a million loss on the sale of long term marketable securities related to one of the company s retirement plans 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was approximately for the year ended december   as compared to in global marine s effective tax rate was in the lower effective tax rate for was due in part to the addition of the santa fe international operations  which increased earnings in international jurisdictions that are taxed at generally lower rates 
the effective tax rate was further lowered by approximately million of reduced annual tax costs related to intercompany debt incurred in connection with the merger 
in  the company recorded a valuation allowance against the nol carryforwards of global marine and its subsidiaries 
the effect of that valuation allowance was to increase tax expense by million 
the company s ability to realize the benefit of global marine s us nol carryforwards requires that the company achieve a certain level of future earnings in the united states prior to the expiration of its nol carryforwards 
reduced activity levels in the us gulf of mexico in contributed to a decrease in the expected future earnings of the company s us subsidiaries 
also  as a result of the merger  the expiration dates of the company s nol carryforwards were accelerated by one year  decreasing the number of years available to fully utilize the nol carryforwards before they expire 
based upon currently anticipated market conditions in the united states  the company did not adjust the valuation allowance against the us nol carryforwards of global marine in the company is a cayman islands company 
the cayman islands does not impose corporate income taxes 
consequently  income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income taxes imposed in these jurisdictions vary substantially 
the company s effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as the company s operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions 
in certain circumstances  management expects that  due to the changing demands of the offshore drilling markets  the company s mobile assets are more likely than not to be redeployed to other locations before those assets operate in certain jurisdictions long enough to give rise to future tax consequences 
as a result  no deferred tax liability has been recognized on the earnings from these assets 
in addition  the company has not provided for us deferred taxes on foreign earnings that could be taxed in the united states upon the occurrence of certain events in a future period 
the company plans  subject to approval by its board of directors  to implement a business restructuring that will better integrate the operations of the company 
this integration will change the us tax classification of certain of its subsidiaries before the occurrence of any events that could give rise to a tax liability 
should management s expectations change regarding the length of time a mobile asset will be operating in a given location  or should the company choose not to implement the planned business restructuring  the company would be required to record additional deferred taxes that could have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company intends to permanently reinvest all of the unremitted earnings of its us subsidiaries in their businesses 
as a result  the company has not provided for deferred taxes on billion of cumulative unremitted earnings at december  should the company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of its us subsidiaries  the company would be required to record additional us deferred taxes that could have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company believes the positions taken on its tax returns with regard to the taxability of its subsidiaries are reasonable  however  it can provide no assurance that its positions will not be challenged or that  if challenged  it would prevail 
in and  various changes to the us federal income tax code were proposed that  if enacted  could adversely affect the company s united states federal income tax position 
many of the proposed changes target united states corporations that have expatriated to a foreign jurisdiction and would in certain cases treat such corporations as united states corporations for united states federal income tax purposes 
several of the proposals would have retroactive application and would treat the company as a united states corporation 
some of the proposals would impose additional limitations on the deductibility for united states federal income tax purposes of certain intercompany transactions  including intercompany interest expense 
at this time  it is impossible to predict what changes  if any  may be enacted  and if enacted  what effect it may have on the company 
however  there is a risk that changes to us tax laws could substantially increase the income tax costs of the company 
if this were to occur  such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and future results of operations 
transactions with affiliates in connection with the initial public offering of santa fe international  santa fe international entered into an intercompany agreement with kuwait petroleum corporation and sfic holdings  which agreement was amended in connection with the merger 
the intercompany agreement  as amended  provides that  as long as kuwait petroleum corporation and its affiliates  in the aggregate  own at least of the company  the consent of sfic holdings is required to change the jurisdiction of any existing subsidiary of the company or incorporate a new subsidiary in any jurisdiction in a manner materially adversely affecting the rights or interests of kuwait petroleum corporation and its affiliates or reincorporate the company in another jurisdiction

in relation to its drilling business in kuwait  the company has an agency agreement with a subsidiary of kuwait petroleum corporation that obligates the company to pay an agency fee based on a percentage of revenues 
the company believes the terms of this agreement are more favorable than those which could be obtained with an unrelated third party in an arm s length negotiation  but the value of such terms is currently immaterial to the company s results of operations

none of the four vessels that the company has under construction or has firm commitments to build has secured a contract for deployment upon completion 
while the company believes that its newbuild rigs will have substantial advantages in efficiency and capability over competitive equipment in the industry  it can provide no assurance that it will be able to obtain contracts for all of its new rigs or that the contract terms will be similar to those for similar equipment in current market conditions 
the company is actively marketing the gsf constellation i and the gsf development driller i

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
effective january  sfas no 
primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
the key provisions of sfas no 
eliminate the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired  and require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
at december   goodwill in the company s condensed consolidated balance sheet totaled approximately million  substantially all of which was recorded in connection with the merger 
the company has defined reporting units within its contract drilling segment based upon economic and market characteristics of these units 
all of the goodwill recorded in connection with the merger has been allocated to the jackup drilling fleet reporting unit  as these rigs were the primary source of value in the merger discussions and negotiations 
the estimated fair value of this reporting unit for purposes of the company s annual goodwill impairment testing is based upon the present value of its estimated future net cash flows  utilizing a discount rate based upon the company s cost of capital 
the company has completed its goodwill impairment testing for and was not required to record a goodwill impairment loss 
the amortization of goodwill existing before the merger was immaterial

 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
provides three alternative methods of transition and disclosure requirements for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the three alternative methods available are the prospective method  the modified prospective method  and the retroactive restatement method 
under the prospective method  which is available only for companies converting to sfas no 
prior to december   compensation cost is recognized for awards granted  modified or settled after the beginning of the year of adoption 
the modified prospective method recognizes compensation costs from the beginning of the year of adoption as if the fair value method had been used for all grants awarded  modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  the retroactive restatement method provides that all periods presented are restated to reflect compensation costs as if the fair value method had been used for all grants awarded  modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  in addition to providing compensation cost recognition methods  sfas no 
also requires certain disclosures  including the accounting method used for each period presented  a description of the method used to report the change in accounting principle and continuing tabular presentation of proforma net income and earnings per share effects for any awards outstanding under the intrinsic method of accounting principles board opinion no 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company has adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no

this interpretation provides disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued and clarifies that a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing certain guarantees shall be recognized at inception of the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the company believes that it has no material guarantees within the scope of fin other than the fully defeased financing leases for two of its drillships

fin is effective for public entities with vies created before february   at the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period starting after june  for vies created after january   fin is effective immediately 
upon the applicable effective date  fin will become the guidance that determines whether consolidation is required and whether the variable interest accounting model must be used to account for existing and new entities 
the company does not believe that it currently has any vies within the scope of fin item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk two of the company s cantilevered jackup rigs are currently operating under similar dayrate contracts that expose the company to commodity price risk 
these two year agreements  expiring in may and october  respectively  each contain a variable dayrate formula linked to crude oil prices  whereby dayrates earned under these contracts increase or decrease in response to increases or decreases in oil prices 
dayrates under these agreements are calculated using a sliding scale formula based on the arithmetic average of the daily closing price of light sweet crude on the new york mercantile exchange nymex  subject to a maximum of per barrel and a minimum of per barrel 
the variable dayrate formula contained in these agreements is comprised of multiple embedded derivative financial instruments as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the fair value of these embedded derivatives fluctuate in response to changes in oil prices 
the company has performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of these risks based on a hypothetical ten percent increase or decrease in nymex light sweet crude futures prices over the remaining lives of these agreements at december  oil prices are dependent on many factors that are impossible to forecast  and actual oil price increases or decreases could be greater than the hypothetical ten percent change 
the company estimates that if average oil prices over the remaining lives of these agreements increase by ten percent  undiscounted cash flows received for these agreements over their respective lives would increase by approximately million and million  respectively 
conversely  a ten percent decrease in oil prices over the life of the agreements would decrease cash flows over their respective lives by approximately million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical ten percent increase in nymex oil prices over the lives of these agreements would increase the net fair values of the embedded derivatives contained in these contracts by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a ten percent decrease in oil prices over the lives of these agreements would decrease the net fair value of the embedded derivatives by approximately million and million  respectively 
an discount rate was applied to the future cash flows of the contracts to determine the net fair values discussed above 
the net fair value  based upon market price  of the embedded derivatives in each of these contracts was an asset of approximately million at december   or million in the aggregate 
as part of the company s overall risk management strategy  the company has entered into a number of commodity caps  swaps and floors designed to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in fair values of the embedded derivatives in these contracts resulting from changes in oil prices 
the net fair values of these derivative financial instruments represented a total obligation of million at december  interest rate risk in the company entered into fixed price contracts with harland and wolff shipbuilding and heavy industries limited totaling million for the construction of two dynamically positioned  ultra deepwater drillships  the glomar cr luigs and the glomar jack ryan 
pursuant to two year  capital lease agreements  the company subsequently novated the construction contracts for the drillships to two financial institutions the lessors  which now own the drillships and lease them to the company 
the company has deposited with three large foreign banks the payment banks amounts equal to the progress payments that the lessors were required to make under the construction contracts  less a lease benefit of approximately million the defeasance payment 
in exchange for the deposits  the payment banks have assumed liability for making rental payments required under the leases and the lessors have legally released the company as the primary obligor of such rental payments 
accordingly  the company has recorded no capital lease obligations on its balance sheet with respect to the two drillships 
the glomar cr luigs and the glomar jack ryan began operating under contract in april and december  respectively 
the company has interest rate risk in connection with its fully defeased financing leases for the glomar jack ryan and glomar cr luigs 
the defeasance payment earns interest based on the british pound sterling three month libor  which approximated at the time of the agreement 
should the defeasance payment earn less than the assumed rate of interest  the company will be required to make additional payments as necessary to augment the annual payments made by the payment banks pursuant to the agreements 
if the december   libor rate of were to continue over the next ten years  the company would be required to fund an additional estimated million during that period 
any additional payments made by the company pursuant to the financing leases would increase the carrying value of its leasehold interest in the rigs and therefore be reflected in higher depreciation expense over their then remaining useful lives 
the company does not expect that  if required  any additional payments made under these leases would be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
the company does not consider its exposure to interest rate fluctuations to be material to its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fair value risk the objectives of the company s short term investment strategy are safety of principal  liquidity maintenance  yield maximization and full investment of all available funds 
as a result  the company s investment portfolio at december   consists primarily of high credit quality commercial paper  eurodollar debt securities and money market funds  all with original maturities of less than nine months 
the company believes that the carrying value of these investments approximates market value at december   due to the short term nature of these instruments 
the company manages its fair value risk related to its long term debt by using interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its fixed rate debt into variable rate debt 
under these interest rate swaps  the company agrees with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between the fixed rate and floating rate amounts  calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount 
in october  the company entered into a fixed for floating interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  effective october through september this interest rate swap is intended to manage a portion of the fair value risk related to the company s notes due under the terms of this swap  the company has agreed to pay the counterparty an interest rate equal to the six month libor rate plus basis points on the notional amount  and the company will receive the fixed rate 
the estimated fair value of this swap was an asset of approximately million at december  the company has designated this swap as a fair value hedge 
the estimated fair value of the company s million principal amount notes due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december   compared to the carrying amount of million 
the estimated fair value of the company s million principal amount notes due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december   compared to the carrying amount of million 
the estimated fair value of the company s million zero coupon convertible debentures due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december   compared to the carrying amount of million 
the company s long term debt is subject to fair value risk due to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the fair value of the company s zero coupon convertible debt is subject to changes in the market price of the company s ordinary shares 
the company has performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of these changes in interest rates and share prices on the fair values of its long term debt based on a hypothetical ten percent increase in market interest rates and a hypothetical ten percent decrease in the price of its ordinary shares 
market interest rate and share price volatility are dependent on many factors that are impossible to forecast  and actual interest rate increases and share price decreases could be more severe than the hypothetical ten percent change 
the company estimates that if prevailing market interest rates had been ten percent higher at december   and all other factors affecting the company s debt remained the same  the fair value of the company s notes due  as determined on a present value basis using prevailing market interest rates  would have decreased by million or  the fair value of the company s notes due would have decreased by million or  and the fair value of the company s zero coupon convertible debt would have decreased by million or 
with respect to the company s zero coupon convertible debt  if the market price of the company s ordinary shares had been ten percent lower at december   and all other factors remained the same  the decrease in the fair value of the zero coupon convertible debt would have been less than one percent 
with respect to the company s fixed for floating interest rate swap  if prevailing market interest rates had been ten percent higher at december   and all other factors had remained the same  the fair value of the company s million notional amount fixed for floating interest rate swap  as determined on a present value basis  would have decreased by million or foreign currency risk the company  through its international operations  is subject to foreign currency risk 
this risk arises from holding net monetary assets cash and receivables in excess of payables denominated in foreign currencies during periods of a strengthening us dollar 
the company attempts to minimize this currency risk by seeking international drilling contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to its estimated local currency based operating costs and in us dollars for the balance of the contract 
due to this strategy  the company has minimized its net asset or liability positions denominated in local currencies and has not experienced significant gains or losses associated with changes in currency exchange rates
