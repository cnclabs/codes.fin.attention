this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto presented under item restructuring on february   a corporate restructuring was completed and everest re group  ltd 
group became the new parent holding company of everest reinsurance holdings  inc holdings  which remains the holding company for group s us based operations 
the company means group and its subsidiaries  except when referring to periods prior to february   when it means holdings and its subsidiaries 
acquisitions on september   holdings completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of gibraltar casualty company gibraltar from the prudential insurance company of america the prudential for million  which approximated book value 
as a result of the acquisition  gibraltar became a wholly owned subsidiary of holdings and  immediately following the acquisition  its name was changed to mt 
mckinley insurance company mt 
mckinley 
in connection with the acquisition of mt 
mckinley  which has significant exposure to asbestos and environmental claims  prudential property and casualty insurance company prupac  a subsidiary of the prudential  provided reinsurance to mt 
mckinley covering million of the first million of any adverse development of mt 
mckinley s reserves as of september  in addition  the prudential guaranteed prupac s obligation to mt 
mckinley 
there were million of cessions under this reinsurance at december   reducing the limit available under this contract to million 
in connection with the mt 
mckinley acquisition  prupac also provided excess of loss reinsurance for of the first million of loss with respect to certain of mt 
mckinley s retrocessions and potentially uncollectible reinsurance coverage 
there were million and million of cessions under this reinsurance during the periods ending december  and  respectively  reducing the limit available under the contract to million 
mt 
mckinley  a run off property and casualty insurer in the united states  has had a long relationship with holdings and its principal operating company  everest reinsurance company everest re 
mt 
mckinley was formed in by everest re and wrote insurance until  when it was placed in run off 
in  mt 
mckinley became a subsidiary of the prudential 
mt 
mckinley is also a reinsurer of everest re 
under a series of transactions dating to  mt 
mckinley reinsured several components of everest re s business 
in particular  mt 
mckinley provided stop loss reinsurance protection  in connection with the company s october  initial public offering  for any adverse loss development on everest re s june  december  for catastrophe losses reserves  with million in limits  of which million remains available the stop loss agreement 
the stop loss agreement and other reinsurance contracts between mt 
mckinley and everest re remain in effect following the acquisition 
however  these contracts became transactions with affiliates effective on the date of the mt 
mckinley acquisition  and their financial impact is thereafter eliminated in consolidation 
effective september   mt 
mckinley and bermuda re entered into a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance agreement  whereby mt 
mckinley transferred  for what management believes to be arm s length consideration  all of its net insurance exposures and reserves to bermuda re 
during  the company completed two additional acquisitions  everest security insurance company everest security  formerly known as southeastern security insurance company  a united states property and casualty company whose primary business is non standard automobile insurance  and everest international reinsurance  ltd 
everest international  formerly known as afc re  ltd  a bermuda based life and annuity reinsurer 
industry conditions the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive  yet cyclical by product and market 
the terrorist attacks on september  the september attacks resulted in losses which reduced industry capacity and were of sufficient magnitude to cause most companies to reassess their capital position  tolerance for risk  exposure control mechanisms and the pricing terms and conditions at which they are willing to take on risk 
the gradual and variable improving trend that had been apparent through and earlier in firmed significantly after the september attacks 
this firming generally took the form of immediate and significant upward pressure on prices  more restrictive terms and conditions and a reduction of coverage limits and capacity availability 
such pressures were widespread  with variability depending on the product and markets involved  but mainly depending on the characteristics of the underlying risk exposures 
the magnitude of the changes was sufficient to create temporary disequilibrium in some markets as individual buyers and sellers adapted to changes in both their internal and market dynamics 
during  the reinsurance and insurance markets continued to firm 
this firming reflects the losses arising from the september attacks as well as reactions to broad and growing recognition that competition in the late s reached extremes in many classes and markets  which ultimately led to inadequate pricing and overly broad terms  conditions and coverages 
the effect of these extremes  which is becoming apparent through excessive loss emergence  varies widely by company depending on product offerings  markets accessed  underwriting and operating practices  competitive strategies and business volumes 
across all market participants however  the aggregate effect has been impaired financial results and erosion of the industry capital base 
coupled with deteriorating investment market conditions and results  and renewed concerns regarding longer term industry specific issues  including asbestos exposure and sub par capital returns  these financial impacts have introduced substantial  and in some cases extreme  pressure for the initiation and or strengthening of corrective action by individual market participants 
these pressures have resulted in firming prices  more restrictive terms and conditions and tightened coverage availability across most classes and markets 
these changes reflect a clear reversal of the general trend from through toward increasingly competitive global market conditions across most lines of business as reflected by decreasing prices and broadening contract terms 
the earlier trend resulted from a number of factors  including the emergence of significant reinsurance capacity in bermuda  changes in the lloyd s market  consolidation and increased capital levels in the insurance and reinsurance industries  as well as the emergence of new reinsurance and financial products addressing traditional exposures in alternative fashions 
many of these factors continue to exist and have taken on additional importance as the result of the firming conditions which have emerged 
as a result  although the company is encouraged by the recent improvements and  more generally  by current market conditions  the company cannot predict with any reasonable certainty whether and to what extent these improvements will persist 
segment information the company  through its subsidiaries  operates in five segments us reinsurance  us insurance  specialty underwriting  international and bermuda 
the us reinsurance operation writes property and casualty reinsurance on both a treaty and facultative basis through reinsurance brokers as well as directly with ceding companies within the united states 
the us insurance operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agent relationships and surplus lines brokers within the united states 
the specialty underwriting operation writes accident and health a h  marine  aviation and surety business within the united states and worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies 
the international operation writes property and casualty reinsurance through the company s branches in london  canada  and singapore  in addition to foreign business written through the company s new jersey headquarters and miami office 
the bermuda operation writes property  casualty  life and annuity business through brokers and directly with ceding companies 
these segments are managed in a carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control  including with respect to capital  investments and support operations 
as a result  management monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments principally based upon their underwriting results 
the company utilizes inter affiliate reinsurance but such reinsurance does not impact segment results  since business is generally reported within the segment in which the business was first produced 
results of operations unusual loss events in as a result of the september attacks  the company incurred pre tax losses  based on an estimate of ultimate exposure developed through a review of its coverages  which totaled million gross of reinsurance and million net of reinsurance 
associated with this reinsurance were million of pre tax charges  predominantly from adjustment premiums  resulting in a total pre tax loss from the september attacks of million 
after tax recoveries relating specifically to this unusual loss event  the net loss from the september attacks totaled million 
over of the losses ceded by the company were pursuant to treaties  where the reinsurers obligations are secured  which the company believes eliminates material reinsurance collection risk 
as a result of the enron bankruptcy in  the company incurred losses  after tax and net of reinsurance  amounting to million 
this unusual loss reflects all of the company s exposures to this event  including underwriting  credit and investment 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums 
gross premiums written increased to  million in from  million in  as the company took advantage of selected growth opportunities and improving pricing in many classes of business  while continuing to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach 
premium growth areas included a million increase in the bermuda operation  which continues to expand its product line offerings  a million increase in the international operation  mainly attributable to growth in the london  canadian and latin american markets  a million increase in the us insurance operation  principally attributable to growth in worker s compensation insurance  a million increase in the us reinsurance operation  primarily reflecting growth across property and casualty lines  and an million increase in the specialty underwriting operation  mainly attributable to growth in marine  aviation and surety business 
the company continued to decline business that did not meet its objectives regarding underwriting profitability 
ceded premiums decreased to million in from million in this decrease was principally attributable to a reduction in cessions made under the company s corporate retrocessional program and to a decrease in ceded premiums in the us insurance operation as a result of changes in this segment s specific reinsurance programs 
ceded premiums in included million and million in adjustment premiums relating to claims made under the and accident year aggregate excess of loss elements of the company s corporate retrocessional programs  respectively 
ceded premiums in included million and million in adjustment premiums relating to claims made under the and accident year aggregate excess of loss elements of the company s corporate retrocessional programs  respectively  with the accident year cessions principally relating to losses incurred as a result of the september attacks and enron bankruptcy 
net premiums written increased by to  million in from  million in this increase was a result of the increase in gross premiums written and the decrease in ceded premiums 
premium revenues 
net premiums earned increased by to  million in from  million in contributing to this increase were a million increase in the bermuda operation  a million increase in the us insurance operation  a million increase in the international operation  a million increase in the us reinsurance operation and a million increase in the specialty underwriting operation 
all of these changes reflect period to period variability in gross written and ceded premiums and business mix  together with normal variability in earnings patterns 
business mix changes occur not only as the company shifts emphasis between products  lines of business  distribution channels and markets but also as individual contracts renew or non renew  almost always with changes in coverage  structure  prices and or terms  and as new contracts are accepted with coverages  structures  prices and or terms different from those of expiring contracts 
as premium reporting and earnings and loss and commission characteristics derive from the provisions of individual contracts  the continuous turnover of individual contracts  arising from both strategic shifts and day to day underwriting  can and does introduce appreciable background variability in various underwriting line items 
expenses 
incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses lae increased by to  million in from  million in the increase in incurred losses and lae was principally attributable to the increase in net premiums earned and modest reserve strengthening in select areas  most notably in directors and officers liability  surety and workers compensation lines  and with respect to asbestos exposures  partially offset by lower catastrophe losses and improvements in rates  terms and conditions in many classes of business  as well as the impact of changes in the company s mix of business 
incurred losses and lae include catastrophe losses  which reflect the impact both of current period events and favorable and unfavorable development on prior period events and are net of reinsurance 
a catastrophe is an event that causes a pre tax loss on property exposures of at least million and has an event date of january  or later 
catastrophe losses  net of contract specific cessions but before cessions under the corporate retrocessional program  were million in  principally relating to european flood losses and hurricanes isidore and kenna  compared to net catastrophe losses of million in  which was principally related to the september attacks

the ceded losses and lae in included million and million of losses ceded under the and accident year aggregate excess of loss components of the company s corporate retrocessional program  respectively 
the ceded losses and lae in included million and million of losses ceded under the and accident year aggregate excess of loss components of the company s corporate retrocessional program  respectively  with the accident year cessions relating principally to losses incurred as the result of the september attacks 
contributing to the increase in incurred losses and lae in from were a million increase in the bermuda operation  principally reflecting reserve strengthening with respect to mt 
mckinley asbestos exposures and increased premium volume  a million increase in the us insurance operation  principally reflecting increased premium volume coupled with changes in this segment s specific reinsurance programs  a million increase in the international operation  principally reflecting increased premium volume and a million increase in the us reinsurance operation  principally due to increased premium volume  partially offset by decreased catastrophe losses 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in the specialty underwriting operation  principally attributable to decreased catastrophe losses

critical accounting policies loss and lae reserves 
the company s most critical accounting policy is the determination of its loss and lae reserves 
the company maintains reserves to cover its estimated ultimate liability for losses and lae with respect to reported and unreported claims 
because reserves are estimates of ultimate losses and lae  management monitors reserve adequacy over time  evaluating new information as it becomes known and adjusting reserves as necessary 
management considers many factors when setting reserves  including its exposure base  generally its earned premiums  its expected loss ratios on current year writings as determined through extensive interaction between its underwriters and actuaries by product and class categories internal actuarial methodologies which analyze the company s experience with similar cases  information from ceding companies and historical trends  such as reserving patterns  loss payments  pending levels of unpaid claims and product mix  current legal interpretations of coverage and liability  economic conditions  and the uncertainties discussed below regarding reserve requirements for asbestos and environmental claims 
based on these considerations  management believes that adequate provision has been made for the company s loss and lae reserves 
actual losses and lae ultimately paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from such reserves  impacting income in the period in which the change is made 
see also footnote to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
asbestos and environmental exposures 
the company continues to receive claims under expired contracts which assert alleged injuries and or damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances  including asbestos 
the company s asbestos claims typically involve potential liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products containing asbestos 
the company s environmental claims typically involve potential liability for a the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or b bodily injury or property damage caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land  air or water 
the company s reserves include an estimate of the company s ultimate liability for asbestos and environmental a e claims for which ultimate value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques 
there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company s potential losses from a e claims 
among the complications are a potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage  b difficulty in identifying sources of a e contamination  c difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and or liability for a e damage  d changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws  e potential for an a e claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods  f long reporting delays  both from insureds to insurance companies and ceding companies to reinsurers  g historical data on a e losses  which is more limited and variable than historical information on other types of casualty claims  h questions concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage  and i uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential a e exposure 
with respect to asbestos claims in particular  several additional factors have emerged recently that further compound the difficulty in estimating the company s liability 
these developments include a continued growth in the number of claims filed  in part reflecting a much more aggressive plaintiff bar  b a disproportionate percentage of claims filed by individuals with no functional injury from asbestos  claims with little to no financial value but that have increasingly been considered in jury verdicts and settlements  c the growth in the number and significance of bankruptcy filings by companies as a result of asbestos claims  d the growth in claim filings against defendants formerly regarded as peripheral  e the concentration of claims in a small number of states that favor plaintiffs  f the growth in the number of claims that might impact the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than the product liability portion  g responses in which specific courts have adopted measures to ameliorate the worst procedural abuses  and h the potential that the u 
s 
congress or state legislatures may consider legislation to address the asbestos litigation issue 
these uncertainties and factors continue to render reserves for a e losses significantly less subject to traditional actuarial analysis than are reserves for other types of losses 
as a result  management believes that no meaningful range for such ultimate losses can be established 
the company establishes reserves to the extent that  in the judgment of management  the facts and prevailing law reflect an exposure for the company or its ceding companies 
in connection with the acquisition of mt 
mckinley  which has significant exposure to a e claims  prupac  a subsidiary of the prudential  provided reinsurance to mt 
mckinley covering million of the first million of any adverse development of mt 
mckinley s reserves as of september  in addition  the prudential guaranteed prupac s obligations to mt 
mckinley 
through december   cessions under this reinsurance agreement have reduced the available remaining limits to million net of coinsurance 
due to the uncertainties discussed above  the ultimate losses may vary materially from current loss reserves and  depending on coverage under the company s various reinsurance arrangements  could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
see also footnote and to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
reinsurance receivable 
the company utilizes reinsurance agreements to reduce its exposure to large claims and catastrophic loss occurrences 
these agreements provide for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses and loss expenses under certain circumstances without relieving the insurer of its obligation to the policyholder 
in the event reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under these reinsurance agreements  the company would not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance recoverable balance 
in some cases  the company may hold partial collateral  including letters of credit and funds held arrangements  for these agreements 
the company establishes reserves for uncollectible balances based on management s assessment of the collectibility of the outstanding balances 
to minimize exposure from uncollectible reinsurance receivables  the company has a reinsurance credit security committee that generally evaluates the financial strength of a reinsurer prior to entering into a reinsurance arrangement 
additionally  creditworthy foreign reinsurers of business written in the united states are generally required to secure their obligations 
management believes that adequate provision has been made for the company s uncollectible balances 
actual uncollectible amounts may vary  perhaps substantially  from such reserves  impacting income in the period in which the change is made 
see also footnote to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
premiums written and earned 
premiums written by the company are earned ratably over the periods of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts or policies 
unearned premium reserves are established to cover the remainder of the unexpired contract period 
such reserves are established based upon reports received from ceding companies or computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data 
written and earned premiums  and the related costs  which have not yet been reported to the company are estimated and accrued 
as earned premium generally correlates with the company s estimate of its exposure base  variations in premium earnings are to a large degree offset by related variability in incurred losses and commission expense 
see also footnote to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
investment valuation 
the company s investment portfolio consists of investments available for sale and accordingly these securities are marked to market on a quarterly basis 
most securities are traded on national exchanges where market values are readily available 
the company holds some privately placed securities that are either valued by an investment advisor or by the company using cash flow projections 
unrealized gains and losses from market fluctuations are reflected as comprehensive income  while market value declines that are considered other than temporary are reflected in the income statement as realized capital losses 
the company considerers many factors when determining whether a market value decline is other than temporary  including the length of time the market value has been below book value  the credit strength of the issuer  the issuer s market sector and the length of time to maturity 
due to the uncertainty of these factors  investment losses may arise and could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

aggregate invested assets  including cash and short term investments  were  million at december    million at december  and  million at december  the increase in cash and invested assets from to resulted primarily from million in cash flows from operations generated in  million of net proceeds from the offering of common shares in february  million of net proceeds from capital trust s issuance of trust preferred securities in november and million in net unrealized appreciation of the company s investments 
these increases were partially offset by million in net payments on holdings credit facility and million in share repurchases 
the increase in cash and invested assets from to resulted primarily from million in cash flows from operations generated in and million in net unrealized appreciation of the company s investments 
these increases were partially offset by million in net payments on holdings credit facility 
loss and lae reserves 
gross loss and lae reserves totaled  million at december    million at december  and  million at december  the increase in was primarily attributable to increased premiums earned  modest reserve strengthening in select areas and normal variability in claim settlements 
the increase in was primarily attributable to increased catastrophe losses resulting from the september attacks  together with increased earned premiums and normal variability in claim settlements 
reinsurance receivables totaled  million at december   million at december  and million at december   with the changes in principally reflecting losses ceded under the accident year aggregate excess of loss element of the company s corporate retrocessional program and losses ceded as part of a reinsurance agreement between mt 
mckinley and prupac 
at december   million  or  was receivable from subsidiaries of london reinsurance group london life 
these receivables are effectively secured by a combination of letters of credit and funds held arrangements under which the company has retained the premium payments due the retrocessionaires  recognized liabilities for such amounts and reduced such liabilities as payments are due from the retrocessionaire 
in addition  million  or  was receivable from continental insurance company continental  which is partially secured by funds held arrangements  and million or  was receivable from prupac  whose obligations are guaranteed by the prudential 
no other retrocessionaire accounted for more than of the company s receivables 
the company generally has exposure to a e losses through its mt 
mckinley operation with respect to insurance policies and through everest re with respect to reinsurance contracts 
in each case  the company s management and analysis of its exposures takes into account a number of features of its business that differentiate the company s exposures from many other insurers and reinsurers that have significant a e exposures 
mt 
mckinley began writing small amounts of a e exposed insurance in and increased the volume of its writings in these writings ceased in  giving mt 
mckinley an approximate year window of potential a e exposure  which is appreciably shorter than is the case for many companies with significant a e exposure 
additionally  due to changes in and standardization of policy forms  it is rare for policies in the s and s to have been issued without aggregate limits on at least the product liability coverage offered  policies issued in earlier decades are generally more at risk of not having aggregate limits 
the vast majority of mt 
mckinley s a e exposed insurance policies are excess casualty policies  with aggregate coverage limits  which by definition also have protection afforded by underlying coverage 
mt 
mckinley s attachment points vary but usually are protected by millions  often tens of millions  of dollars of underlying coverage 
the excess nature of most of mt 
mckinley s policies also offers protection against non product claims for example  claims arising under general liability coverage 
although under some circumstances an excess policy could be exposed to non product claims  such claims generally pose more of a risk to primary policies because non product claims are generally less likely to aggregate 
in addition  environmental claims arise under general liability coverage  and generally do not aggregate 
thus  these claims tend to create exposure for primary policies to a greater extent than excess policies 
virtually all of the mt 
mckinley policies that are still potentially exposed to claims have policy language providing that expenses were paid within limits rather than in addition to limits 
this is a substantial difference from primary coverage  which would most often cover expenses in addition to limits 
everest re was formed in but was not fully engaged in underwriting casualty business under which a e exposures generally arise until  and it effectively eliminated a e exposures through contract exclusions effected in therefore  everest re has an approximate year window of a e exposure  much shorter than that of many reinsurance companies that have significant a e exposures 
in the earlier years of its existence  everest re was not as heavily involved in casualty business as in property business  which generally is not exposed to asbestos claims 
everest re generally took smaller lines of exposure per contract than many other reinsurers operating in the casualty reinsurance market and those lines were generally also smaller than the excess limits provided by mt 
mckinley policies 
this means that the potential adverse development on everest re s reinsurance business would not be subject to the same level of volatility as would be the case for companies having greater exposures per risk 
everest re reinsured both primary and excess policies 
however  its claim experience to date indicates that the majority of its reinsurance supported excess policies 
as a result  most of everest re s exposure derives from excess policies similar to those written by mt 
mckinley 
with respect to both the mt 
mckinley and everest re operations  the company was not a member of the asbestos claims facility wellington or the center for claims resolution ccr claim settlement facilities 
insurers supporting those facilities made broad commitments concerning the application of insurance coverage to asbestos claims 
with respect to its direct insurance exposures  the fact that the company has not made those commitments may allow it to resolve insurance exposure to wellington ccr insureds more economically than if it had joined these facilities 
with respect to its reinsurance exposures  although the company was not a signatory to the wellington or ccr facilities  it has  within the bounds of its reinsurance contracts  generally supported ceding companies that were signatories 
because the insurers supporting these facilities have generally paid their exposures more quickly than non signatory insurers  the company believes that this has generally meant that it has paid its reinsurance exposure more quickly than it likely would have if it had not been subject to wellington ccr payments 
the company believes that its a e exposures are unique and differentiated from those insurers and reinsurers with appreciable a e exposure by the points noted above  but there can be no assurance that such factors will protect the company from adverse development  perhaps material  or allow it to secure advantages in the settlement of its claims obligations 
additional losses  including those relating to currently unrecognized latent injuries  the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by the company  or the reinsurance and insurance industry generally  may emerge in the future 
such future emergence  to the extent not covered by existing retrocessional contracts  could have material adverse effects on the company s future financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the table below summarizes the company s overall reserves and claim activity for asbestos and environmental claims  on both a gross and net of ceded reinsurance basis  for the periods indicated asbestos and environmental reserves years ended december  dollars in millions gross basis beginning of period reserves incurred losses and lae reported losses change in ibnr total incurred losses and lae paid losses end of period reserves net basis beginning of period reserves incurred losses and lae reported losses change in ibnr total incurred losses and lae paid losses end of period reserves reported losses and paid losses for are net of million and million  respectively  reflecting the establishment of mt 
mckinley s reserves at the acquisition date 
net paid losses  excluding the impact of the mt 
mckinley acquisition transaction  were million 
the gross reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures increased in  principally due to an increase in management s estimate of the ultimate asbestos and environmental exposures  the effect of which was partially offset by paid losses 
the net reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures decreased in  principally due to an increase in losses ceded as part of a reinsurance agreement between mt 
mckinley and prupac  the effect of which was partially offset by paid losses 
the gross and net reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures in include holdings acquisition of mt 
mckinley 
industry analysts have developed a measurement  known as the survival ratio  to compare the asbestos and environmental reserves among companies with such liabilities 
the survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a company s current reserves by the three year average of paid losses  and therefore measures the number of years that it would take to exhaust the current reserves based on historical payment patterns 
using this measurement  the company s net three year asbestos and environmental survival ratio was years at december  adjusting these ratios to include the effect of the remaining limits of reinsurance available under the reinsurance agreement with prupac  the measures rise to the equivalent of years at december  because the survival ratio was developed as a comparative measure of reserve strength and not of absolute reserve adequacy  the company considers  but does not rely on  the survival ratio when evaluating its reserves 
as noted earlier  there were developments in affecting asbestos exposures in general and the company s asbestos exposures in particular 
these developments together with enhancements in the company s claim management and analytical processes resulted in the reserve strengthening noted earlier 
these developments and actions have increased the emphasis on asbestos exposures as a separate component of the company s a e exposures 
despite the company s approach of handling a e exposures on a combined basis  management believes additional disclosure of the asbestos element of its a e exposures is appropriate 
the following tables summarize reserves and claim activity for asbestos claims  on both a gross and net of ceded reinsurance basis  for the periods indicated with particular emphasis on the differentiation of insured categories within the mt

during the year ended december   the company repurchased million of its common shares at an average price of per share with all such repurchases occurring in the three months ended september  at december   million shares remained under the existing repurchase authorization 
as part of the company s restructuring  the treasury shares held by the company prior to february  were retired  resulting in a reduction to treasury shares with a corresponding reduction of paid in capital and common shares 
liquidity and capital resources capital 
the company s business operations are in part dependent on the company s financial strength  and the market s perception thereof  as measured by shareholders equity  which was  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the company has flexibility with respect to capitalization as the result of its perceived financial strength  including its financial strength ratings as assigned by independent rating agencies  and its access to the debt and equity markets 
the company continuously monitors its capital and financial position  as well as investment and security market conditions  both in general and with respect to the company s securities  and responds accordingly 
on july   the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  providing for the issuance of up to million of securities 
generally  under this shelf registration statement  group may issue common shares  preferred shares  debt  warrants and hybrid securities  holdings may issue debt securities and warrants and capital trust may issue trust preferred securities 
in november  pursuant to a trust agreement between holdings and jpmorgan chase bank  the property trustee  and chase manhattan bank usa  the delaware trustee  capital trust completed a public offering of million of trust preferred securities  resulting in net proceeds of million 
the proceeds of the issuance were used to purchase million of junior subordinated debt securities of holdings that will be held in trust by the property trustee for the benefit of the holders of the preferred securities 
holdings used the proceeds from the sale of the junior subordinated debt for general corporate purposes and made capital contributions to its operating subsidiaries 
capital trust will redeem all of the outstanding trust preferred securities when the junior subordinated debt securities are paid at maturity on november  holdings may elect to redeem the junior subordinated debt securities  in whole or in part  at any time after november  if such an early redemption occurs  the outstanding trust preferred securities will also be proportionately redeemed 
distributions on the trust preferred securities are cumulative and are paid quarterly in arrears 
disbributions relating to the trust preferred securities for the year ended december  were million 
on november   the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  providing for the issuance of up to million of common equity 
on february   the company completed an offering of  of its common shares at a price of per share  which resulted in million of proceeds before expenses of approximately million related to the offering 
the company has used the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes 
on october   the company filed a post effective amendment to this registration statement that removed the remaining securities from registration 
on march   holdings completed public offerings of million principal amount of senior notes due march  and million principal amount of senior notes due march  during  the net proceeds of these offerings and additional funds were distributed by holdings to group 
interest expense incurred in connection with these senior notes was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
liquidity 
the company s liquidity requirements are met on a short term and long term basis by funds provided by premiums collected  investment income and collected reinsurance receivables balances  and by the sale and maturity of investments  together with the availability of funds under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company s net cash flows from operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following table shows cash flows from operating activities  as well as the impact of select transactions on those cash flows  for the years ended december   and cash flow from operations catastrophe loss payments stop loss agreement recoveries derivative settlement payments net tax payments non recurring receipt of shares cash flow from operations  net of adjustments recoveries under the stop loss agreement with mt 
mckinley prior to the acquisition of mt 
mckinley 
net tax payments for include a million payment to the internal revenue service in connection with the company s tax year liabilities 
this one time payment effectively settled a deferred tax liability relating to the tax basis losses incurred in the tax year 
this payment  which related to a timing item  had no impact on the company s results of operations for the period 
non recurring receipt of shares in a demutualized insurer 
the growth in net cash flows from operating activities reflects improvements in product pricing  together with growth in the company s invested asset base  and is generally consistent with expectations  given the company s investment strategies and mix of business and the normal variability of premium collections and the payout of loss reserves 
the company s current investment strategy seeks to maximize after tax income through a high quality  diversified  taxable bond and tax preferenced fixed maturity portfolio  while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity 
the company s mix of taxable and tax preferenced investments is adjusted continuously  consistent with the company s current and projected operating results  market conditions and the company s tax position 
proceeds from sales  calls and maturities and investment asset acquisitions were  million and  million  respectively  in compared to  million and  million  respectively  in and  million and  million  respectively  in on december   holdings entered into a three year senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders the credit facility 
on november   the maturity date of the credit facility was extended to december  wachovia bank  national association formerly first union national bank is the administrative agent for the credit facility 
the credit facility is used for liquidity and general corporate purposes 
the credit facility provides for the borrowing of up to million with interest at a rate selected by holdings equal to either the base rate as defined below or an adjusted london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin 
the base rate is the higher of the rate of interest established by wachovia bank from time to time as its prime rate or the federal funds rate plus per annum 
on december   the credit facility was amended to extend the borrowing limit to million for a period of days 
this day period expired during the three months ended march  and the limit reverted to million 
the amount of margin and the fees payable for the credit facility depend upon holding s senior unsecured debt rating 
group has guaranteed holdings obligations under the credit facility 
the credit facility requires the company to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than to  holdings to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of to and everest re to maintain its statutory surplus at million plus of future aggregate net income and of future aggregate capital contributions 
as of december   the company was in compliance with these requirements 
during the years ended december   and  holdings made payments on the credit facility of million  million and million  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  holdings had new credit facility borrowings of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december  and  holdings had outstanding credit facility borrowings of million and million  respectively 
interest expense incurred in connection with these borrowings was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the cash flow activity in included million of new cash resulting from the offering of common shares in february and million of new cash from the issuance of trust preferred securities in november 
the cash flow activity in included million of new cash resulting from the acquisitions of mt 
mckinley and everest international and million in proceeds from holdings offering of senior notes 
the company has arrangements available for the issue of letters of credit  which letters are generally collateralized by the company s cash or investments 
at december   million of letters of credit were issued and outstanding under these arrangements 
exposure to catastrophes 
as with other reinsurers  the company s operating results and financial condition can be adversely affected by volatile and unpredictable natural and other disasters  such as hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  floods  fires and explosions 
any such catastrophic event could generate insured losses in one or many of the company s treaties or lines of business  including property and or casualty exposures 
although the company attempts to limit its exposure to acceptable levels  including through the purchase of reinsurance when considered to be cost effective  it is possible that an actual catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
the company employs various techniques  including licensed software modeling  to assess its accumulated exposure 
such techniques are inherently more difficult to apply to non property exposures 
accumulated exposures with respect to catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss pml 
the company defines pml as its anticipated maximum loss  taking into account contract limits  caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area  such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake of such a magnitude that it is expected to occur once in every years 
management believes that the company s greatest catastrophe exposure worldwide from any single event is to an earthquake affecting the west coast of the united states where the company estimates it has a pml exposure of million  including workers compensation exposures 
the company further estimates that its pml exposure with respect to its greatest windstorm exposure  which relates to a hurricane affecting the east coast of the united states  is million and that its single event international pml exposure is million 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses from one or more catastrophic events that exceed  perhaps by a substantial amount  its estimated pml 
the company employs a retrocessional approach under which the company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or exposure accumulations or as a corporate level retrocessional program covering the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of the company s operations 
all reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions with respect to the pricing  terms  conditions and availability of such coverage  with the aim of securing cost effective protection 
the level of reinsurance coverage varies over time  reflecting the underwriter s and or company s view of the changing dynamics of both the underlying exposure and the reinsurance markets 
if a single catastrophe were to occur in the united states that resulted in million of gross losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses alae in an amount equivalent to the company s pml including its property and workers compensation exposures  management estimates that the effect on the company s income before and after taxes would be approximately million and million  respectively 
such impact represents approximately of the company s beginning of year capital 
for and initially in  the company has chosen not to purchase corporate retrocessional protection and to generally de emphasize the purchase of specific reinsurance by its underwriters reflecting the company s view that its exposures in the context of its capital and financial position do not warrant reinsurance purchases at current price levels 
for both and  the company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession coverage  which provides up to million of recoveries if everest re s consolidated statutory basis accident year loss ratio exceeds a loss ratio attachment point provided in the contract for the respective accident years 
each arrangement provides for an adjustment premium  which reduces the net benefit by approximately  in the event that the coverage is used 
the remaining limit available under these coverages is million and million  respectively 
see item risk management and retrocession arrangements for further details 
dividends during  and  the company declared and paid shareholder dividends of million  million and million  respectively 
as an insurance holding company  the company is partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to its shareholders 
the payment of dividends to group by holdings and to holdings by everest re is subject to delaware regulatory restrictions and the payment of dividends to group by bermuda re is subject to bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions 
management expects that  absent significant catastrophe losses  such restrictions should not affect everest re s ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support holdings general corporate needs and holdings and bermuda re s ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support group s general corporate needs

market sensitive instruments the securities and exchange commission financial reporting release requires registrants to clarify and expand upon the existing financial statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments  and other financial instruments collectively  market sensitive instruments 
the company does not enter into market sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the company s current investment strategy seeks to maximize after tax income through a high quality  diversified  taxable and tax preferenced fixed maturity portfolio  while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity 
the company s mix of taxable and tax preferenced investments is adjusted continuously  consistent with its current and projected operating results  market conditions  and the company s tax position 
the fixed maturities in the investment portfolio are comprised of non trading available for sale securities 
additionally  the company invests in equity securities  which it believes will enhance the risk adjusted total return of the investment portfolio 
the company has also engaged in a small number of credit default swaps and specialized equity options  the market sensitivity of which is believed not to be material 
the overall investment strategy considers the scope of the company s present and anticipated operations 
in particular  estimates of the financial impact resulting from non investment asset and liability transactions  together with the company s capital structure and other factors  are used to develop a net liability analysis 
this analysis includes estimated payout characteristics for which the investments of the company provide liquidity 
this analysis is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation  duration and credit quality 
the change in overall market sensitive risk exposure principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the year  with no material change in the underlying risk characteristics 
the company s billion investment portfolio is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities that are subject to interest rate risk and foreign currency rate risk  and equity securities that are subject to equity price risk 
the impact of these risks on the investment portfolio is generally mitigated by changes in the value of operating assets and liabilities and their associated income statement impact 
interest rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity portfolio  including short term investments  due to change in market interest rates 
in a declining interest rate environment  it includes prepayment risk on the million of mortgage backed securities in the billion fixed maturity portfolio 
prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the security 
the tables below display the potential impact of market value fluctuations and after tax unrealized appreciation on the fixed maturity portfolio as of december  and based on parallel basis point shifts in interest rates up and down in basis point increments 
for legal entities with a us dollar functional currency  this modeling was performed on each security individually 
to generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage backed securities  changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments are taken into account 
for legal entities with a non us dollar functional currency  the effective duration of the involved portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the market value change under the various interest rate change scenarios

each of the company s foreign operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory guidelines 
generally  the company prefers to maintain the capital of its foreign operations in us dollar assets  although this varies by regulatory jurisdiction in accordance with market needs 
each foreign operation may conduct business in its local currency as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates 
the primary foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are the canadian dollar  the british pound sterling and the euro 
the company mitigates foreign exchange exposure by a general matching of the currency and duration of its assets to its corresponding operating liabilities 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 the company translates the assets  liabilities and income of non us dollar functional currency legal entities to the us dollar 
this translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
the primary functional foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are the canadian dollar  the euro and the british pound sterling 
the tables below display the potential impact of a parallel increase and decrease in foreign exchange rates on the valuation of invested assets subject to foreign currency exposure in increments as of december  and this analysis includes the after tax impact of translation from transactional currency to functional currency as well as the after tax impact of translation from functional currency to the us dollar reporting currency

the company invests in high quality common and preferred stocks that are traded on the major exchanges in the united states and funds investing in such securities 
the primary objective in managing the million equity portfolio is to provide long term capital growth through market appreciation and income

the duration and nature of these specialized instruments are such that no active trading market exists 
this was recognized at the time the transactions were entered into and was the principal rationale for the company s use of a probability weighted cash flow model for its analysis of the economics of these transactions  an approach quite similar to analytical models used throughout the company s reinsurance business 
as these specialized equity put options are derivatives within the framework of fas no  the company is required to report the fair value of these instruments in its balance sheet and record any changes to fair value in its statement of operations 
the company has recorded fair values for its obligations on these specialized equity put options at december  and december  of million and million  respectively  however  the company does not believe that the ultimate settlement of these transactions is likely to require a payment that would exceed the initial consideration received or any payment at all 
as there is no active market for these instruments  the determination of their fair value is based on an industry accepted option pricing model which requires estimates and assumptions  including those regarding volatility and expected rates of return 
the table below estimates the impact of potential movements in interest rates and the s p index  which are the principal factors affecting fair value of these instruments  looking forward from the fair value at december  these are estimates and there can be no assurances regarding future market performance

the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
risk factors the following risk factors  in addition to the other information provided in this report  should be considered when evaluating the company 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of the company s common shares could decline significantly 
the company s results may fluctuate as a result of factors generally affecting the insurance and reinsurance industry 
the results of companies in the insurance and reinsurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
factors that affect the industry in general could also cause the company s results to fluctuate 
the industry s profitability can be affected significantly by o fluctuations in interest rates  inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment  which affect returns on invested capital and may impact the ultimate payout of loss amounts  o rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products  o volatile and unpredictable developments  including weather related and other natural catastrophes  o events like the september  attacks  which affect the insurance and reinsurance markets generally  o changes in reserves resulting from different types of claims that may arise and the development of judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liability  and o the overall level of economic activity and the competitive environment in the industry 
if the company s loss reserves are inadequate to meet its actual losses  the company s net income would be reduced or it could incur a loss 
the company is required to maintain reserves to cover its estimated ultimate liability of losses and loss adjustment expenses for both reported and unreported claims incurred 
these reserves are only estimates of what the company thinks the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances known to the company 
because of the uncertainties that surround estimating loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses  the company cannot be certain that ultimate losses will not exceed these estimates of losses and loss adjustment reserves 
if the company s reserves are insufficient to cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses  the company would have to augment its reserves and incur a charge to its earnings 
these charges could be material 
the difficulty in estimating the company s reserves is increased because the company s loss reserves include reserves for potential asbestos and environmental liabilities 
asbestos and environmental liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many reasons  including the long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage  difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental contamination  long reporting delays and difficulty in properly allocating liability for the asbestos or environmental damage 
the company s inability to assess underwriting risk accurately could reduce its net income 
the company s success is dependent on its ability to assess accurately the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained 
if the company fails to assess accurately the risks it retains  the company may fail to establish appropriate premium rates and the company s reserves may be inadequate to cover its losses  requiring augmentation of the company s reserves  which in turn  could reduce the company s net income 
decreases in rates for property and casualty reinsurance and insurance could reduce the company s net income 
the company primarily writes property and casualty reinsurance and insurance 
the property and casualty industry historically has been highly cyclical 
rates for property and casualty reinsurance and insurance are influenced primarily by factors that are outside of the company s control 
any significant decrease in the rates for property and casualty insurance or reinsurance could reduce the company s net income 
if rating agencies downgrade their ratings of the company s insurance company subsidiaries  the company s future prospects for growth and profitability could be significantly and adversely affected 
the company s insurance company subsidiaries  other than mt 
mckinley and everest international  currently hold an a superior financial strength rating from am best company 
everest re  bermuda re and everest national hold an aa positve financial strength rating from standard poor s ratings services 
everest re and bermuda re hold an aa excellent financial strength rating from moody s investors service  inc financial strength ratings are used by insurers and reinsurance and insurance intermediaries as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers 
in addition  the rating of a company purchasing reinsurance may be adversely affected by an unfavorable rating or the lack of a rating of its reinsurer 
a downgrade or withdrawal of any of these ratings might adversely affect the company s ability to market its insurance products and would have a significant and adverse effect on its future prospects for growth and profitability 
the company s reinsurers may not satisfy their obligations 
the company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve the company of its liability to the insured 
in addition  reinsurers may be unwilling to pay the company even though they are able to do so 
the failure of one or more of the company s reinsurers to honor their obligations in a timely fashion would impact the company s cash flow and reduce its net income and could cause the company to incur a significant loss 
if the company is unable to purchase reinsurance and transfer risk to reinsurers  its net income could be reduced or the company could incur a loss 
the company attempts to limit its risk of loss by purchasing reinsurance to transfer a portion of the risks it assumes 
the availability and cost of reinsurance is subject to market conditions  which are outside of the company s control 
as a result  the company may not be able to successfully purchase reinsurance and transfer risk through reinsurance arrangements 
a lack of available reinsurance might adversely affect the marketing of the company s business and or force the company to retain all or a part of the risk that cannot be reinsured 
if the company were required to retain these risks and ultimately pay claims with respect to these risks  the company s net income could be reduced or the company could incur a loss 
the company s industry is highly competitive and the company may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
the company s industry is highly competitive and has experienced significant price competition 
the company competes in the bermuda  united states and international markets with domestic and international insurance companies 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company  have been operating for longer than the company and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry  which can be a significant competitive advantage 
in addition  the company expects to face further competition in the future 
the company may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
the company is dependent on its key personnel 
the company s success has been  and will continue to be  dependent on its ability to retain the services of its existing key executive officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of the services of any of its key executive officers or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect the company s ability to conduct its business 
this dependency is particularly important for the company s bermuda operations where  under bermuda law  non bermudians  other than spouses of bermudians  are not permitted to engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without a work permit issued by the bermuda government 
a work permit is only granted or extended if the employer can show that  after proper public advertisement  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian  is available who meets the minimum standards for the position 
the bermuda government has announced a policy that places a six year term limit on individuals with work permits  subject to specified exemptions for persons deemed to be key employees 
these restrictions make it difficult to hire and retain highly qualified personnel in bermuda 
if work permits are not obtained or renewed for the company s key employees in bermuda  the company could lose their services  which could adversely affect the company s ability to conduct its business 
the value of the company s investment portfolio and the investment income it receives from that portfolio could decline as a result of market fluctuations and economic conditions 
a significant portion of the company s investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities and a smaller portion consists of equity securities 
both the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
for example  the fair market value of the company s fixed income securities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates 
the fair market value of the company s fixed income securities can also decrease as a result of any downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of those securities to deteriorate 
the net investment income that the company realizes from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations can also cause net investment income from investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  to differ from the income anticipated from those securities at the time the company bought them 
in addition  if issuers of individual investments are unable to meet their obligations  investment income will be reduced and realized capital losses may arise 
because all of the company s securities are classified as available for sale  changes in the market value of the company s securities are reflected in its financial statements 
similar treatment is not available for liabilities 
as a result  a decline in the value of the securities in the company s portfolio could reduce its net income or cause the company to incur a loss 
insurance laws and regulations restrict the company s ability to operate 
the company is subject to extensive regulation under us  state and foreign insurance laws 
these laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to the company by its operating subsidiaries  impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments that they can hold  prescribe solvency standards that must be met and maintained by them and require them to maintain reserves 
these laws also require disclosure of material intercompany transactions and require prior approval of certain extraordinary transactions 
these extraordinary transactions include declaring dividends from operating subsidiaries that exceed statutory thresholds 
these laws also generally require approval of changes of control 
the company s failure to comply with these laws could subject it to fines and penalties and restrict it from conducting business 
the application of these laws could affect the company s liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its common shares and could restrict the company s ability to expand its business operations through acquisitions involving the company s insurance subsidiaries 
failure to comply with insurance laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company may not have all required licenses and approvals or may not comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authorities interpretation of the laws and regulations 
if the company does not have the requisite licenses and approvals or does not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend the company from carrying on some or all of its activities or monetarily penalize the company 
these types of actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s holding company structure could prevent it from paying dividends on its common shares 
group is a holding company whose most significant assets consist of the stock of its operating subsidiaries 
thus  group s ability to pay dividends on its common shares in the future may be dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to group 
this ability is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  regulatory and other factors beyond the company s control 
payment of dividends and advances and repayments from some of group s operating subsidiaries are regulated by us  state and foreign insurance laws and regulatory restrictions  including minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds 
accordingly  group s operating subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to group in the future  which could prevent the company from paying dividends or making other payments or distributions on its securities 
the company may experience exchange losses if it does not manage its foreign currency exposure properly 
the company s functional currency is the united states dollar 
however  the company writes a portion of its business and receives a portion of its premiums in currencies other than united states dollars 
the company also maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in investments denominated in currencies other than united states dollars 
consequently  the company may experience exchange losses if its foreign currency exposure is not properly managed or otherwise hedged 
if the company seeks to hedge its foreign currency exposure by using forward foreign currency exchange contracts or currency swaps  the company will be subject to the risk that the counter parties to those arrangements will fail to perform  or that those arrangements will not precisely offset the company s exposure 
if us tax law changes  the company s net income may be reduced 
in the last few years  some members of congress have expressed concern about us corporations that move their place of incorporation to low tax jurisdictions 
also  some members of congress have expressed concern over a competitive advantage that foreign controlled insurers and reinsurers may have over us controlled insurers and reinsurers due to the purchase of reinsurance by us insurers from affiliates operating in some foreign jurisdictions  including bermuda 
legislation has recently been proposed in congress that would increase the us tax burden on so called inverting companies and increase the us tax burden on related party reinsurance transactions 
the company does not know whether this legislation or any similar legislation will ever be enacted into law 
if it were enacted  the us tax burden on the company s bermuda operations  or on some business ceded from its licensed us subsidiaries to some offshore reinsurers  could be increased 
this could reduce the company s net income 
group and or bermuda re may be subject to us corporate income tax  which would reduce the company s net income 
the income of bermuda re is a significant portion of the company s worldwide income from operations 
the company has established guidelines for the conduct of its bermuda operations that are designed to ensure that bermuda re is not engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the united states 
based on its compliance with those guidelines  the company believes that bermuda re should not be required to pay us corporate income tax  other than withholding tax on us source dividend income 
however  if the irs successfully contended that bermuda re was engaged in a trade or business in the united states  bermuda re would be required to pay us corporate income tax on any income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the united states  and possibly the us branch profits tax 
even if the irs successfully contended that bermuda re was engaged in a us trade or business  the us bermuda tax treaty would preclude the irs from taxing bermuda re s income except to the extent that its income were attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by that subsidiary 
the company does not believe that bermuda re has a permanent establishment in the united states 
if the irs successfully contended that bermuda re did have income attributable to a permanent establishment in the united states  it would be subject to us tax on that income 
the company believes it qualifies for benefits under the us barbados tax treaty 
based on the company s compliance with guidelines designed to ensure that it generates only immaterial amounts  if any  of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the united states  the company believes that it should be required to pay only immaterial amounts  if any  of us corporate income tax  other than withholding tax on us source dividend income 
however  if the irs successfully contended that the company had material amounts of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the united states  the company would be required to pay us corporate income tax on that income  and possibly the us branch profits tax 
even if the irs successfully contended that the company had material amounts of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the united states  the us barbados tax treaty would preclude the irs from taxing the company s income  except to the extent that its income were attributable to a permanent establishment maintained in the united states 
the company does not believe that it has material amounts of income attributable to a permanent establishment in the united states 
if the irs successfully contended  however  that the company did have income attributable to a permanent establishment in the united states  the company would be subject to us tax on that income 
if bermuda re became subject to us income tax on its income or if the company became subject to us income tax on more than immaterial amounts of income  the company s income could also be subject to the us branch profits tax 
in that event  group and bermuda re would be subject to taxation at a higher combined effective rate than if they were organized as us corporations 
the combined effect of the us corporate income tax rate and the branch profits tax rate is a net tax rate of 
the imposition of these taxes would reduce the company s net income 
holders of the company s common shares could be subject to us taxes on undistributed income of group and or bermuda re 
us holders of common shares generally will not be subject to any us tax until they receive a distribution from group or dispose of their common shares 
however  special provisions of the us internal revenue code of  which the company refers to in this document as the code  may apply to us taxpayers who directly  indirectly or by attribution own or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of share capital of group and or bermuda re 
under these provisions  those taxpayers generally will be required to include in their income their pro rata share of the income of group and or bermuda re as earned  even if not distributed 
the company has attempted to avoid having its shareholders become subject to these provisions by including in group s by laws provisions that limit the ownership of the common shares to levels that will not subject us shareholders to us tax on undistributed income under these provisions 
based on these bye laws  the company believes that its shareholders should not be subject to us tax on undistributed income 
in addition  special provisions of the code apply to us persons who are shareholders of a foreign insurance company and have related person insurance income allocated to them 
related person insurance income  often called rpii  is investment income and premium income derived from the direct or indirect insurance or reinsurance of the risk of o any us tax payer who directly or indirectly through foreign entities owns shares of a foreign insurance company  or o any person related to a us taxpayer meeting the above definition 
the rpii provisions of the code could apply to us taxpayers who directly  indirectly or by attribution own any shares of bermuda re if o or more of the value or voting power of the share capital of bermuda re is owned directly  indirectly or by attribution by us taxpayers  o or more of the value or voting power of the share capital of bermuda re is owned directly  indirectly or by attribution by us taxpayers  or persons related to us taxpayers  who are insured or reinsured by bermuda re  and o bermuda re has gross rpii equal to or more of its gross insurance income 
the company currently believes that less than of the value or voting power of the share capital of bermuda re is owned directly  indirectly or by attribution by us taxpayers insured or reinsured by it or persons related to those taxpayers  and or that less than of the gross insurance income of bermuda re for any taxable year will constitute rpii 
however  if neither of these conditions is satisfied  since the company s us shareholders are treated by the code as indirectly owning shares of bermuda re  they will be required to include in their income their pro rata share of bermuda re s rpii as earned  even if not distributed 
gains resulting from the sale of the company s common shares by us shareholders could be taxed in the us as dividends 
generally  a us shareholder will realize capital gain or loss on the sale or exchange of the common shares 
however  the irs could contend that special provisions of the code apply and that the amount of any gain equal to the company s allocable untaxed earnings and profits should be taxed as a dividend 
if the irs successfully contended that those provisions apply to the company  shareholders would be taxed on that amount of gain at the rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the lower rates applicable to long term capital gains 
assuming that none of the company s non us subsidiaries have any rpii  the company believes that these provisions of the code should not apply to the disposition of any common shares by a us shareholder who holds less than of the outstanding common shares 
the organization for economic cooperation and development and the european union are considering measures that might increase the company s taxes and reduce its net income 
a number of multinational organizations  including the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd  the european union  the financial action task force and the financial stability forum have all recently identified some countries as not participating in adequate information exchange  engaging in harmful tax practices or maintaining adequate controls to prevent corruption  such as money laundering activities 
the oecd has threatened non member jurisdictions that do not agree to cooperate with the oecd with punitive sanctions by oecd member countries  though specific sanctions have yet to be adopted by oecd member countries 
it is as yet unclear as to what these sanctions will be  who will adopt them and when or if they will be imposed 
on april   the oecd published a list of uncooperative tax havens  which are those jurisdictions from whom the oecd has not received commitments to the oecd s principles of regulatory and tax transparency and effective exchange information 
the governments of both bermuda and barbados have made these commitments 
as a result  neither bermuda nor barbados was listed as an uncooperative tax haven 
group and or bermuda re may become subject to bermuda tax  which would reduce the company s net income 
group and bermuda re currently are not subject to income or capital gains taxes in bermuda 
both companies have received an assurance from the bermuda minister of finance under the exempted undertakings tax protection act of bermuda to the effect that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that imposes any tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then that tax will not apply to them or to any of their operations or their shares  debentures or other obligations until march  this assurance does not prevent the application of any of those taxes to persons ordinarily resident in bermuda and does not prevent the imposition of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the land tax act of of bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to any property leased to the company 
there are currently no procedures for extending these assurances 
as a result  group and bermuda re could be subject to taxes in bermuda after march   which could reduce the company s net income 
group may become subject to barbados tax  which would reduce the company s net income 
group has obtained an international business company license under the barbados international business companies act  based on this license  group is entitled to special tax benefits  including a preferred rate of tax on profits and gains and an exemption from withholding tax in respect of any dividends  interest  royalties  fees or management fees deemed to be paid to another international business company or to a person not resident in barbados 
group has also obtained from the ministry of economic development a fifteen year guarantee in accordance with section of the international business companies act with respect to its continued eligibility for this preferred status 
this guarantee is applicable until and is subject to negative resolution  which means that this guarantee can be revoked at any time 
in addition  there are currently no procedures for extending this guarantee 
as a result  group could be ineligible for these benefits after that period  which could reduce the company s net income 
the company s net income will be reduced if us excise and withholding taxes are increased 
bermuda re is subject to an excise tax on reinsurance and insurance premiums it collects with respect to risks located in the united states 
in addition  bermuda re may be subject to withholding tax on dividend income from united states sources 
these taxes could increase and other taxes could be imposed in the future on bermuda re s business  which could reduce the company s net income 
regulatory challenges in the united states could adversely affect the ability of bermuda re to conduct business 
bermuda re does not intend to be licensed or admitted as an insurer or reinsurer in any us jurisdiction 
under current law  bermuda re generally is permitted to reinsure us risks from its office in bermuda without obtaining those licenses 
however  the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework has become subject to increased scrutiny 
in the past  there have been congressional and other initiatives in the united states regarding increased supervision and regulation of the insurance industry  including proposals to supervise and regulate reinsurers domiciled outside the united states 
if bermuda re were to become subject to any insurance laws of the united states or any us state at any time in the future  it might be required to post deposits or maintain minimum surplus levels and might be prohibited from engaging in lines of business or from writing types of policies 
complying with those laws could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to conduct business in the bermuda market 
bermuda re may need to be licensed or admitted in additional jurisdictions to develop its business 
as bermuda re s business develops  it will monitor the need to obtain licenses in jurisdictions other than bermuda in order to comply with applicable law or to be able to engage in additional insurance related activities 
in addition  bermuda re may be at a competitive disadvantage in jurisdictions where it is not licensed or does not enjoy an exemption from licensing relative to competitors that are so licensed or exempted from licensing 
bermuda re may not be able to obtain any additional licenses that it determines are necessary or desirable 
furthermore  the process of obtaining those licenses is often costly and may take a long time 
bermuda re s ability to write reinsurance may be severely limited if it is unable to arrange for security to back its reinsurance 
many jurisdictions do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements without appropriate security 
bermuda re s reinsurance clients generally require it to post a letter of credit or enter into other security arrangements 
if bermuda re is unable to obtain or maintain a letter of credit facility on commercially acceptable terms or unable to arrange for other types of security  its ability to operate its business may be severely limited 
if bermuda re defaults on any letter of credit that it obtains  it may be required to prematurely liquidate a substantial portion of its investment portfolio and other assets pledged as collateral 
security holders may not be able to recover damages from the company and some of its directors  officers and experts named in this report 
the company is organized under the laws of bermuda 
some of its directors and officers  as well as some of the experts named in this report  may reside outside the united states 
a substantial portion of the company s and their assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the united states 
security holders may not be able to effect service of process within the united states on directors and officers of the company and those experts who reside outside the united states 
security holders also may not be able to recover against them or the company on judgments of us courts or to obtain original judgments against them or the company in bermuda courts  including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws
