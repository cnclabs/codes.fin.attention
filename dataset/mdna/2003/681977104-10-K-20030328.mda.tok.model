the decline in new sales was partially offset by the increase in repeat sales as the company continues to realize the benefits of a strong customer base

the company s experience has been that increases in advertising expenditures have a direct impact on the growth of net sales 
the company expenses all advertising costs when the advertising first takes place 
as a result  quarter to quarter comparisons are impacted within and between quarters by the timing of television  radio and internet advertisements and by the mailing of the company s printed advertisements

this legal effort included investing resources to ensure that the multi district litigation settlement agreement with johnson johnson allowed the company to purchase contact lenses directly from vistakon 
the company expects to continue to incur significant legal and professional fees as it continues this proactive approach although it expects these amounts to decrease in fiscal due to the resolution of some issues  including the agreement to become an authorized retailer of vistakon contact lenses 
purchased in process research and development 
the value allocated to purchased in process research and development was charged to expense upon consummation of the acquisition of igel 
the valuation of the in process research and development was determined using the income approach method  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows 
the amount allocated represents the estimated purchased in process technology for projects that have not yet reached commercial viability 
based on preliminary assessments  the value of these projects was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technologies into commercially via ble products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the sale of those products reduced by the portion of revenue attributable to core technology  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the cash flows have been discounted at a rate of return of  which has been adjusted for an additional risk premium

recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
under sfas no 
 a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
a liability is incurred when an event obligates a company to transfer or use assets ie  when an event leaves the company little or no discretion to avoid transferring or using the assets in the future 
under previous accounting rules  if a company s management approved an exit plan  the company generally could record the costs of that plan as a liability on the approval date  even if the company did not incur the costs until a later date 
under sfas no 
 some of those costs might qualify for immediate recognition  others might be spread over one or more quarters  and still others might not be recorded until incurred in a much later period 
the company is currently reviewing sfas no 
 which is effective for periods after december  prospectively  and does not expect it to have a significant impact on its results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  the company has elected to continue using the intrinsic method of accounting for employee stock based compensation 
therefore  sfas no 
will not have any effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which expands previously issued accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees 
fin requires recognition of an initial liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing a guarantee 
guarantees are required to be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for periods ending after december  for certain guarantees issued after december   the fair value of the obligation must be reported on the balance sheet 
the company does not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have a material impact on its results of operations and financial position

critical accounting policies accounting polices that require significant judgments and estimates include revenue recognition including sales returns and allowances  excess and obsolete inventories  realizability of long lived assets including intangible assets  realizability of deferred income tax assets  accounting for the acquisition of igel  stock based compensation  and legal and regulatory contingencies 
a description of the company s significant accounting policies is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
judgments and estimates are based on historical experience as well as relevant facts and circumstances known at each reporting date 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
sales are generally recognized at the time of shipment to the customer 
net sales consist of product sales less provisions for sales returns and allowances  which provisions are made at the time of sale 
the company accrues an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances based on historical information  adjusted for current economic trends 
to the extent actual returns and allowances vary from historical experience  revisions to the allowances may be required 
in assessing the realizability of inventories  the company makes judgments as to future demand requirements and product expiration dates 
the inventory requirements change based on projected customer demand  which changes due to market conditions and product life cycle changes 
the company has significant long lived tangible and intangible assets consisting of property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangibles 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment analysis requires the use of expected future undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset 
as of december   the company determined that no impairment existed 
a significant portion of the total long lived assets were generated from the company s recent acquisition of igel  which operations have yet to generate positive cash flows 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of long lived assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
deferred income tax assets are assessed for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided as necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to amounts expected to be realized 
as of the december   the company has net deferred income tax assets of million which are net of a valuation allowance of million related to the company s singapore deferred income tax assets
