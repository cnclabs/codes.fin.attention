item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
all references herein to the term fiscal year shall mean a year ended march of the year specified 
the company commenced operations in as a provider of telecommunications network transmission products that enable advanced telecommunications services over copper telephone wires 
until fiscal  the company derived substantially all of its revenues from its telephone company access products tap product lines  particularly the sale of network interface unit niu products and related products 
niu products accounted for approximately  and of revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company introduced its first dsl products in fiscal and these products accounted for approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
niu products and dsl products are the two major products within the company s telecom equipment business 
telecom equipment constituted approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company has also provided audio teleconferencing services since fiscal  which constituted approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company has two reportable segments 
these segments are strategic business units that are managed separately because each business requires different technologies and market strategies 
they consist of a telecommunications equipment manufacturer of local loop access products  which include telephone company access products tap and broadband products 
tap products are primarily network interface unit niu products and broadband products are primarily dsl  and a multi point telecommunications service bureau  operated through the company s subsidiary conference plus  inc conference plus  inc 
specializes in audio teleconferencing  multi point video conferencing  broadcast fax and multimedia teleconference services 
below is a table that compares annual revenue from the company s two reportable segments and the two main equipment product groups 
fiscal of fiscal of fiscal of revenue revenue revenue broadband equipment    tap equipment    total equipment segment    services segment    total revenue    the company s operating results during fiscal years  and were adversely effected by the downturn in general economic conditions and more specifically  the downturn in the telecommunications industry 
as a result of the economic downturn  the company has experienced competitive pricing pressures and less than anticipated sales in both of its business segments 
telephone companies have reduced spending on low speed tap transmission products although the company believes that spending on broadband has been impacted to a lessor extent by the economic downturn 
the company had excess inventory and less than anticipated customer sales during fiscal the decline in product prices in fiscal year due to the recession resulted in portions of the company s inventory to be stated above the estimated selling prices less cost to sell 
accordingly  the company recognized an inventory adjustment to net realizable value  charges for excess and obsolete inventory  and the write off of fixed assets of million in fiscal year as a result of the economic downturn  the company initiated a realignment in the second quarter of fiscal year certain products  projects and a customer relationship were discontinued 
the company incurred reorganization charges of and million in fiscal and respectively  in its efforts to realign the company s operating expenses with its revenues 
to offset the effects of the recession and the discontinued customer relationship  in fiscal  the company has maintained a lower level of inventory  adjusted its forecasting process to account for the impact of the recession and continued to reduce costs 
if the company has not adjusted its operations to adequately take into account the impact of the continued economic downturn or if the downturn worsens  then the company could experience less than anticipated unit sales and increased inventory balances  which would adversely affect the company s business 
in addition  in fiscal  the company s operating results were negatively impacted by the loss of a significant customer in the company s services segment 
additional customer losses or the inability to add new customers could negatively impact the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company s customer base is comprised primarily of the regional bell operating companies rbocs  independent domestic local exchange carriers and public telephone administrations located outside the us due to the stringent quality specifications of its customers and the regulated environment in which its customers operate  the company must undergo lengthy approval and procurement processes prior to selling its products 
accordingly  the company must make significant upfront investments in product and market development prior to actual commencement of sales of new products 
in addition  to remain competitive  the company must continue to invest in new product development and invest in targeted sales and marketing efforts to cover new product lines 
as a result of the significant increases in research and development and sales and marketing expenses related to new product and market development  the company s results of operations were adversely impacted in fiscal and research and development and sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal as the company focused its expenditures in these areas on targeted product areas but the expenditures remained consistent as a percentage of revenue 
the company expects to continue to evaluate new product opportunities and engage in extensive research and development activities 
this will require the company to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing  which could adversely affect short term results of operations 
in view of the company s reliance on the dsl market for revenues and the unpredictability of orders and pricing pressures  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
revenues from tap products such as nius have declined in recent years as telephone companies continue to move to networks that deliver higher speed digital transmission services 
failure to increase revenues from new products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company uses estimates and judgements in applying its accounting policies which have a significant impact on the results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the following are the company s most critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable the company sells products primarily to various telecommunications providers and distributors 
sales to these customers have varying degrees of collection risk associated with them 
judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables based on aging  historical experience and customer s financial condition 
inventory reserves the company reviews ending inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand  product lifecycle status and product development plans 
the company also evaluates ending inventory for lower of cost or market 
prices related to future inventory demand are compared to current and committed inventory values 
inventory purchase commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into commitments for the purchase of inventory 
the commitments are at market rates and normally do not extend beyond one year 
should there be a dramatic decline in revenues  as there was in fiscal  the company may incur excess inventory and subsequent losses as a result of these commitments 
the company has established reserves for anticipated losses on such commitments 
goodwill and intangibles under new accounting rules  which became effective in fiscal  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles are no longer amortized but subject to annual impairment tests 
the company determined that it operated in two reporting units for the purpose of completing the impairment test of goodwill 
these reporting units are telecom equipment and telecom services 
the company utilizes the comparison of its market capitalization and third party appraisal of its telecom services reporting unit to book value as an indicator of potential impairment 
the company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal these tests showed no impairment of goodwill 
on an ongoing basis  the company reviews intangible assets and other long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues represented by certain items in the company s statements of operations for the periods indicated fiscal year ended march  equipment services total revenues cost of equipment cost of services total cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative goodwill and intangible amortization goodwill and intangible impairment restructuring charge total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense  net interest expense income loss before income taxes income taxes cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss fiscal years ended march   and revenues 
revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
revenues decreased and in fiscal and  respectively  from the preceding years 
the fiscal decrease of million was primarily due to a million decrease in broadband revenue 
broadbank revenue was impacted by a million reduction in sales to an international customer 
this reduction resulted from technological advances that reduced the demand for the company s product 
tap revenue decreased million due to reduced demand resulting as telephone companies continue to transition to networks that deliver higher speed digital transmission services as well as the economic downturn in the telecommunications industry 
the fiscal decrease of million was primarily due to a million decrease in tap revenue due to reduced demand resulting from the economic downturn in the telecommunications industry offset by a million increase in dsl revenue due primarily to higher unit volume 
service revenue increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased audio conference calling volume 
service revenue decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a reduction in call minutes resulting from the economic downturn and the loss of one major customer that resulted in a million revenue reduction 
this was offset in part by an increase in teleconferencing minutes due to customers choosing to hold meetings using teleconference services instead of traveling because of war  health concerns around travelling to locations with outbreaks of communicable diseases and terrorist threats 
gross margin 
gross margin was million  million and million and gross margin as a percentage of revenues was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal gross margin was negatively effected by an adjustment to record inventory at net realizable value and charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million 
of this charge  million related to inventory held during the year and million related to inventory purchase commitments in excess of anticipated requirements 
the fiscal gross margin was negatively effected by additional adjustments to record inventory at net realizable value and charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million and positively impacted by a million benefit recorded related to resolution of a disputed expense with a supplier in the conference plus inc subsidiary 
the increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue before inventory charges from the previous year was primarily the result of improved product mix 
the fiscal gross margin was positively effected by million as the company was able to sell modem inventory which had been reserved as excess and obsolete based on the estimated technological life of the modems at march  the improved gross margin in fiscal was primarily due to reduced material  labor  and handling costs  particularly in the broadband product group 
the company believes continued pricing pressures affecting its equipment segment could continue to adversely impact margins in the future 
the company expects that any anticipated price reductions will be offset in part with continued cost reductions and efficiencies 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  constituting  and of revenues  respectively 
in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses decreased by million or from the previous year

the company reduced warranty reserves by  in fiscal resulting from actual warranty costs being less than estimated at the end of fiscal the remainder of the decrease was due primarily to the fiscal reorganizations  which reduced employee related expenses and outside consulting expenses  and other cost cutting measures that were taken as a result of the economic downturn in the telecommunications industry 
the company believes that sales and marketing expense in the future will continue to be a significant percent of revenue and will be required to expand its product lines  bring new products to market and service customers 
the company believes the reduced sales and marketing spending in fiscal will not have an adverse effect on the company s future earnings 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  constituting  and of revenues  respectively 
in fiscal  research and development decreased by million or from the prior year

this decrease was due primarily to the fiscal reorganizations  which reduced employee related expenses and outside consulting expenses  and other cost cutting measures that were taken as a result of the economic downturn in the telecommunications industry 
there were no customer funded engineering projects in fiscal the company believes that research and development expenses will be a significant percent of revenue and will be required for the company to remain competitive 
the company believes the reduced research and development spending in fiscal will not have an adverse effect on the company s future earnings 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  constituting  and of revenues  respectively 
general and administrative expenses remained constant at approximately million in fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses decrease by million or from the prior year 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the fiscal reorganizations  which were a result of the economic downturn in the telecommunications industry 
the company believes that the reduced general and administrative spending in fiscal will not have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
goodwill and intangible amortization 
intangible assets include goodwill  synergistic goodwill and product technology related to the march  acquisition of teltrend inc for million shares of class a common shares valued at million 
goodwill and intangible amortization expense decreased from fiscal to fiscal due to adoption of the statements of financial accounting standards sfas issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
under the new rules  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the company performed the first impairment test as of april  and its annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal and no write down was required 
goodwill and intangible impairment 
after the fiscal reorganizations  and given the current and expected market conditions in the niu and low speed digital data products portion of the business acquired from teltrend  it became apparent that the goodwill acquired with the teltrend acquisition was impaired 
in accordance with its policies  the company completed an evaluation of the fair value of the teltrend long lived assets including goodwill during the quarters ended december  and march  the company reported non cash charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of recorded goodwill and intangibles related to the teltrend acquisition to their estimated fair value 
restructuring charge 
the company recognized restructuring costs of million in the three months ended march  approximately million of the total restructuring cost had been accrued in connection with the purchase of teltrend inc and related primarily to the termination of approximately teltrend inc employees 
the remaining million of the restructuring costs has been charged to operations and related to personnel  legal  and other related costs incurred in order to eliminate redundant employees due to the acquisition of teltrend inc the goal of the restructuring plan was to combine and streamline the operations of the two companies and to achieve synergies related to the manufacture and distribution of common product lines

the reversal relates to a reduction in an accrual for lease costs due to the sublet of a leased facility at conference plus  inc in fiscal approximately employees were impacted by these reorganizations 
as of march   the company paid approximately million of these accrued restructuring costs leaving a balance of million 
a table which summarizes the restructuring charges and their utilization can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company and is incorporated herein by reference 
other expense  net

interest expense 
interest expense was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal increase in interest expense was a result of increased usage of bank debt and interest accrued on past due accounts payable  most of which was converted to a vendor notes payable in june the fiscal decrease in interest expense was a result of reducing bank and vendor debt 
income taxes 
no income tax was recorded in fiscal years or an income tax charge of  was recorded in fiscal due to the results on an internal revenue service audit on teltrend inc for pre acquisition periods 
in fiscal   and the company was able to generate   and  respectively  in tax credits resulting primarily from research and development activities

in fiscal  the company s deferred tax assets decreased primarily due to the reduction of inventory reserves 
as such  the company utilized million of recorded valuation reserves as less valuation reserves were required to record the deferred tax assets at an amount realizable by the company s tax planning strategy 
quarterly results of operations the following tables present the company s results of operations for each of the last eight fiscal quarters and the percentage relationship of certain items to revenues for the respective periods 
the company believes that the information regarding each of these quarters is prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements of the company appearing elsewhere in this form k

quarterly broadband revenues increased during fiscal and fiscal due to increased unit sales of dsl products 
tap revenues decreased during the fiscal and quarters due to reduced unit sales 
conference plus service revenues experienced steady growth through the first two quarters of fiscal due primarily to increased audio conference calling traffic volume 
service revenues decreased in the final two quarters of fiscal and the first two quarters of fiscal due to the slowing economy and the loss of one large customer 
service revenue increased in the final two quarters of fiscal due to increased call minutes 
the increase in teleconferencing minutes was due in part to customers choosing to hold meetings using teleconference services instead of traveling because of war  health concerns around travelling to locations with outbreaks of communicable diseases and terrorist threats 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue has also varied from quarter to quarter 
the low margins in the fiscal quarters are primarily a result of the increased volume in dsl products that have lower percent margins 
due to anticipated slow demand in certain products in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recognized an inventory adjustment to market value and excess inventory charge of million 
the september  gross margin was positively effected by million as the company was able to sell modem inventory which had been reserved as excess and obsolete based on the estimated technological life of the modems at march  the improved gross margin in fiscal was primarily due to reduced material  labor  and handling costs  particularly in the broadband product group 
the company believes continued pricing pressures affecting its equipment segment will continue to adversely impact margins in the future 
the company expects that these anticipated price reductions will be offset in part with continued cost reductions and efficiencies 
operating expenses decreased in the fiscal quarters compared to fiscal primarily due to the restructuring the company has implemented in response to the slowing economy and lack of general demand in the telecom industry 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses increased in the last three quarters of fiscal due to goodwill impairment and restructuring charges taken during the quarters 
during fiscal  quarterly operating expenses remained relatively flat except for the fourth quarter  which was impacted by the company recording a million bonus for selected employees and profit sharing contribution expense for all employees offset by a  reduction in warranty reserves in its equipment segment 
the company expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
the company believes that fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the market price of the class a common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
factors which have had an influence on and may continue to influence the company s results of operations in a particular quarter include the size and timing of customer orders and subsequent shipments  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  timing of product introductions or enhancements by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products  technological changes in the telecommunications industry  competitive pricing pressures  accuracy of customer forecasts of end user demand  write offs for obsolete inventory  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in the mix of products sold  quality control of products sold  disruption in sources of supply  regulatory changes  capital spending  delays of payments by customers  working capital deficits and general economic conditions 
sales to the company s customers typically involve long approval and procurement cycles and can involve large purchase commitments 
accordingly  cancellation or deferral of one or a small number of orders could cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
because the company generally ships products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based in large part on anticipated future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall of orders 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of demand in relation to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have an almost immediate adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations and profitability

million and million were outstanding under these notes as of may  and respectively 
in connection with the company s management changes implemented at its subsidiary conference plus  inc  in fiscal  the company purchased of the outstanding shares of common stock of conference plus  inc from former officers of conference plus  inc for approximately million 
the purchase price was based upon the minority interest value set forth in the annual appraisal of conference plus  inc obtained by the company that is completed by an independent financial advisor 
as of march   the company had paid  in cash for these shares with the remainder to be paid over a one to three year term 
at march  the company had various operating leases for facilities and equipment 
the total minimum future rental payments are million  million  million  million  million and million for fiscal years     and thereafter  respectively 
the company s operating activities used cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively and generated cash of in fiscal cash used by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from net loss and increases in inventory in the equipment segment offset in part by net income in the services segment  non cash depreciation and amortization and increased accounts payable in both segments 
the increased inventory and accounts payable were a result of the actual product demand being less than anticipated demand 
cash used by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from net loss and reductions in accounts payable in the equipment segment offset in part by net income in the services segment  non cash depreciation and amortization and decreased inventory in the equipment segment 
the decrease of inventory resulted from using inventory in fiscal that was on hand at the end of fiscal the decrease in accounts payable resulted from converting accounts payable to vendor debt in the equipment segment 
cash generated by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from net income  non cash depreciation and amortization in both segments and reductions in inventory offset in part by reductions in accounts payable in the equipment segment 
the inventory reductions were achieved by selling products throughout the year that were in inventory at march  the company believes that its current inventory level is necessary to satisfy ongoing business operations 
capital expenditures in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the equipment segment capital expenditures in fiscal   and were million  million and million  respectively 
of the million spent in fiscal  was for computer hardware and software to increase the enterprise resource planning erp system infrastructure required by the increased number of employees due to the teltrend acquisition and to fund e commerce projects 
the remainder was spent on leasehold improvements and machinery and equipment 
the and capital expenditures in the equipment segment were primarily for machinery and research and development equipment purchases 
the services segment capital expenditures in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
these expenditures were primarily for teleconference bridge equipment 
at march   the company s principle sources of liquidity were million of cash and the secured revolving credit facility under which the company was eligible to borrow up to an additional million based upon receivables and inventory levels 
cash in excess of operating requirements  if any  will be used to pay down debt or invested on a short term basis in federal government agency instruments and the highest rated grade commercial paper 
the company believes that future cash requirements will be satisfied by cash generated from operations and its current credit facility for the next twelve months 
in june  the company retained robert w 
baird company to act as an advisor on a possible divestiture of the company s services subsidiary  conference plus  inc at this time  the company is not actively pursuing any divestiture transactions but may do so in the future if adequate consideration can be obtained and if the company has use for the proceeds 
future obligations and commitments consisted of the following payments due by year in thousands total thereafter debt     future minimum lease payments for operating leases future obligations and commitments        in the normal course of business operations  the company also has purchase commitments related to certain raw materials in the equipment segment and local and long distance telephone service commitments in the service segment that are not included in the table above 
the company had a deferred tax asset of approximately million at march  the company has recorded a valuation allowance reserve of million to reduce the recorded deferred tax asset to million 
the net operating loss carryforward begins to expire in realization of deferred tax assets associated with the company s future deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
although realization of the deferred tax asset is not assured as the company has incurred tax operating losses for the  and fiscal years  management believes that it is more likely than not that it will generate taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the tax benefit 
portions of these deferred tax assets are expected to be utilized  prior to their expiration  through a tax planning strategy available to the company 
the tax planning strategy upon which the company is relying involves the potential sale of the company s owned conference plus inc subsidiary that the company might pursue depending upon its strategic plans and cash needs 
the estimated gain generated by the sales of this business would generate sufficient taxable income to offset the recorded deferred tax assets 
the company obtained an independent appraisal of the value of the business in the fourth quarter of fiscal year this appraisal  which is based on discounted future cash flows  was used in the company s evaluation of the recorded net deferred tax assets and it was determined that the tax planning strategy was sufficient to support the realization of the recorded deferred income tax assets 
on a quarterly basis  management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
if the appraised value of conference plus inc is not sufficient to generate taxable income to recover the deferred tax benefit recorded  an increase in the valuation allowance will be required through a charge to the income tax provision 
however  if the company achieves sufficient profitability or has available additional tax planning strategies to utilize a greater portion of the deferred tax asset  a reduction in the valuation allowance will be recorded
