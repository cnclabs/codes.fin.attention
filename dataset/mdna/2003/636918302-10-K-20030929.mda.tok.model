health card derives its revenue from the provision of comprehensive pharmacy benefit management services to sponsors of prescription benefit plans 
substantially all of the services health card provides to its sponsors are related to pharmacy benefit programs and services 
health card also recognizes administrative fees and earns rebates at the time of claims adjudication 
revenue for the pbm division is earned and recognized as follows administrative fees are agreed upon with the sponsor on either a per claim charge or a per plan participant per month charge 
per claim fees are billed to sponsors for the claims adjudicated during the period 
per plan participant per month fees are generally billed to sponsors at the beginning of the month 
since january   all services have been provided on a fee for service basis only 
the amount of revenue related to the drugs dispensed by pharmacies participating in health card s pharmacy network is recognized at the time of dispensing the drug as the cost is incurred 
the amount of revenue recognized is reduced by the amount of rebates that health card shares with its sponsors 
the specific terms of the contracts that health card enters into with its sponsors will determine whether health card recognizes the gross revenue related to the cost of the prescriptions filled 
in certain cases  the company has not recognized the gross revenue or cost related to prescriptions filled for a specific sponsor 
this has no impact on the company s gross profit since neither the revenue nor the related cost of the prescriptions is recorded 
the following table sets forth the breakdown of health card s revenues relating to pharmaceuticals dispensed and administrative fees in thousands years ended june  revenues relating to pharmaceuticals    administrative fees and other    total revenues    health card does not take possession or legal ownership of the pharmaceuticals dispensed by the retail pharmacy network or its out sourced mail order facilities  although health card assumes the legal responsibility and financial risk of paying for dispensed pharmaceuticals whether or not health card is paid by its sponsors 
health card does take possession and dispenses pharmaceuticals from its mail order facility and its specialty pharmacy as of august  health card utilizes its comprehensive pharmacy benefit database to perform outcome studies and to develop disease information programs which are used to reduce overall healthcare costs 
the company s integrail division uses its software tools to analyze and predict outcomes for both medical and pharmacy data 
these programs currently produce a small amount of revenue  but is starting to attract interest in the marketplace 
health card believes that these value added information based services are becoming a more important component of managed care as well as management of the overall healthcare dollar  and therefore these services may provide an increasing source of revenue for health card in the future 
cost of claims includes the amounts paid to network pharmacies  including mail service pharmacies  for pharmaceutical claims  and reductions resulting from the gross rebates received from drug manufacturers 
cost of claims are recognized as follows the contractual obligation of health card to pay for these drugs is recorded as cost of claims at the time of dispensing of the drug by the pharmacy network 
cost of claims is reduced by the rebates that health card receives 
rebates are earned from drug manufacturers based on drugs utilized by plan participants at the time of dispensing 
health card s portion of these rebates  which varies by sponsor  is recorded monthly based upon the claims adjudicated in that month 
health card processes its rebate claims either direct with the drug manufacturers  through its wholly owned subsidiary  specialty  for which it receives administrative fees  or through a third party rebate administrator 
effective july   health card has entered into an agreement with a third party administrator to handle all of its consolidated rebate claims which it does not otherwise submit direct to the drug manufacturers 
the amount of rebates recognized as reductions to revenue or cost of claims is based on estimates tied to actual claims data 
the third party administrator provides estimates to health card based on its analysis of the amount of rebates that health card s claims should generate 
these estimates are prepared based on estimates of how health card s claims might influence the market share of a particular drug covered under an agreement with a drug manufacturer 
market share is generally defined as the percentage of utilization of a certain drug or drugs within its therapeutic class 
under health card s contract with the administrator  health card receives a specified minimum amount per claim days after the end of a quarter 
amounts above the minimum are shared between the administrator and health card with final settlement twelve months after a quarter end 
health card accrues rebates based upon an estimate provided by the administrator 
health card computes the amount of rebates due direct from the drug manufacturers based on the actual claims data  the criteria established in each individual contract  and the specified payment schedules 
the drug manufacturers are obligated to reimburse health card for earned rebates within a specified period of time 
quarterly  health card reconciles its estimates to amounts received from the manufacturers 
certain of health card s sponsors are entitled to all or a portion of rebates received by health card  which portion varies contractually by sponsor 
the manufacturer rebates retained by health card  after the sponsors receive their contractual amounts  have historically had a significant impact on health card s financial performance 
for the fiscal years ended june   and the rebates retained by health card has equaled  and  respectively  of the company s total gross profit 
due to the expected continued growth and diversification of health card s business  health card expects rebates to continue to account for a significant  but declining  percentage of its total gross profit 
if such rebate programs were to be discontinued or adversely altered by drug manufacturers  or if the terms of health card s rebate sharing arrangements with its sponsors were adversely altered when these arrangements expire  there could be a material adverse effect on health card s business  operating results and financial condition 
credit risk relating to the rebates receivable is evaluated based on the financial strength of the rebate administrator and the drug manufacturers 
health card believes that most of the drug manufacturers are fortune companies 
health card does not believe a credit risk reserve is necessary 
the pharmacy benefit management industry is intensely competitive  generally resulting in continuous pressure on health card s gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
in recent years  industry consolidation and dramatic growth in managed healthcare have led to increasingly aggressive pricing of pharmacy benefit management services 
given the pressure on all parties to reduce healthcare costs  health card expects this competitive environment to continue for the foreseeable future 
health card plans to continue its organic growth through increased marketing of its services and by expanding the range of services offered  including value added consulting and information based services through its integrail division  mail order services through its facility in florida  and specialty pharmacy services through its ascend division 
health card believes these services to be in growing demand within the healthcare industry 
in addition  health card intends to continue to pursue an acquisition program to supplement its organic growth by making acquisitions of other pharmacy benefit management service providers  as well as related services providers 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  of the increase  million was due to the inclusion of revenues from centrus  since it was acquired on january  and included a full fiscal year in compared to a little over five months in the fiscal year ended june  another million of the increase was due to revenues related to new sponsors or new services offered during fiscal these increases were partially offset by a revenue decrease related to two factors two major sponsors terminated their contracts with health card  one effective june  and one effective december  leading to a reduction in revenue of approximately million  and there were certain contracts during the twelve months ended june  that the company recognized on a net revenue basis versus fewer contracts during the twelve months ended june  that the company recognized on a net revenue basis 
the specific terms of the contracts that health card enters into with its sponsors will determine whether health card recognizes the gross revenue related to the cost of the prescriptions filled 
for those contracts that health card recognizes net revenue  there is no impact on gross profit since neither the revenue nor the related costs of the prescriptions is recorded 
another factor affecting the year over year increase was rebates payable to the company s sponsors increased by for the twelve months ended june  as compared to the twelve months ended june  since these rebates are treated as a reduction in revenues  this led to a reduction in the overall year over year revenue increase 
the majority of the balance of the increase  or approximately million  was due primarily to increased revenues from other existing sponsors as a result of several factors including higher charges relating to increased cost of pharmaceuticals  new drugs  plan participant growth and an increase in the average number of claims per plan participant 
cost of claims increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  centrus accounted for million  of the increase 
this increase was partially offset by the two factors described in the previous paragraph  namely  the loss of two major sponsors and the recognizing of certain contracts on a net revenue basis 
an increase of million in gross rebates received  which is treated as a reduction in cost of claims  for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the fiscal year ended june  also led to a reduction in the year over year increase 
the balance of the increase in cost of claims is related to the increased revenue as described above related to both new and existing sponsors 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of claims decreased from to for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
these same two factors contributed to the declining costs as a percentage of revenue 
the two major sponsors are managed care organizations 
industry wide  managed care clients have a greater cost of claims  and consequently a lower gross margin  than other types of business in the pbm industry 
while not all of the revenue associated with these two sponsors was replaced by new business  the new business  for the most part was not managed care  so consequently the cost of claims on the new business was lower than on the business it replaced 
in addition  the contracts recognized on a net revenue basis decrease the overall company costs as a percentage of revenue due to the cost not being recognized on the contracts recorded on the net revenue basis 
the decline in cost of claims as a percentage of revenues was moderated by the higher cost of claims on the centrus book of business  which serves managed care clients primarily 
centrus cost of claims for the fiscal year ended june  ran about percentage points greater than the rest of the company s business  and since centrus accounted for of the company s revenue in the fiscal year  this impacted the overall cost of claims percentage 
gross profit increased from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june   a million  or  increase 
in addition  to the revenue volume increase  centrus accounted for million  or  of the increase 
the increase in rebates and administrative fees related to the collection of rebates after accounting for the amount of rebates that are shared with sponsors  accounted for another million  or 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenue  increased from to for the twelve months ended june  and june   respectively 
the contracts the company recognizes on a net revenue basis have the effect of improving the gross margin as a percent of revenue due to the lower revenue base 
partially offsetting this impact  the company has seen some decline in profit margins due to competitive pressures 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  which include amounts charged by affiliates  increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  this increase is primarily related to the acquisition of centrus 
while the expenses specifically related to centrus were million greater in the twelve months ended june  as compared to the five months since the acquisition in the twelve months ended june   this was partially offset by reductions in other areas of the company related to the full integration of centrus 
the company analyzed every department in the company and made decisions concerning the most efficient way to operate regardless of location 
this evaluation has led to synergies across the company and has allowed the company to maximize the utilization of its resources 
it is anticipated that this kind of analysis and deployment of resources will continue as the company grows 
selling  general  and administrative expenses also increased in the twelve months ended june  due to the start up of two new activities in the quarter ended december  the company acquired integrail as of november  see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
in the months since the company acquired integrail  approximately million of expenses were incurred primarily related to salary and benefits and depreciation and amortization 
the other activity was the start up of the build out of a mail order facility in miramar  florida 
prior to july   the company out sourced the total actual fulfillment of prescriptions that are ordered by mail 
by bringing these services in house the company will be better able to control service and cost for its customers 
for the twelve months ended june   approximately  of expenses were incurred on this endeavor 
the division started dispensing pharmaceuticals as of july  due to the additions of integrail and the mail order facility along with centrus for the full twelve months in the fiscal year ended june   the company s expenses increased million for expenditures related to increases in compensation and benefits  primarily associated with new employees including senior management 
some of this increase was also related to the replacement of resources from related parties with full time employees see below 
in addition  the company incurred the following additional expenses in the twelve months ended june  approximately  of expenses incurred related to two acquisitions which the company did not complete  approximately  related to a settlement of a new york state sales tax audit  and the payment of  related to a terminated consulting agreement 
general and administrative expenses charged by affiliates decreased approximately million  or  year over year from million to million for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the company has eliminated many of the related party transactions effective january  the majority of the decrease related to reduced information technology services and management and consulting services procured from affiliated companies 
the hiring of full time employees and the use of outside consultants replaced the use of affiliated companies to update the information technology infrastructure 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the main reason for the increase is the impact of recognizing more contracts on a net revenue basis  as that has the effect of dividing these same expenses over a smaller gross revenue base 
in addition  the acquisition of integrail and the start up of nmhcmail led to an increase in this percentage 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company incurred other expense  net  of approximately  for the fiscal year ended june   the company incurred other expense  net  of approximately  the components of the approximate  increase in net expense were an approximate  increase in interest expense  an approximate  decrease in interest income  offset by an approximate  additional gain on sold assets during the fiscal year ended june  the primary reasons for the net increase in expense were the interest expense incurred on the company s revolving credit facility and on the note offering to finance the acquisition of centrus and integrail see item  description of business recent acquisitions  and note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof  and the reduction in interest income since all cash balances go towards paying off the revolving credit facility 
partially offsetting the increase in other expense was an approximate  increase in deferred gain on the sale of assets related to a sale leaseback transaction  which gain of approximately  was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized over the life of the lease  which is thirty six months 
see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
income before the provision for income taxes increased approximately million  or  from approximately million  for the fiscal year ended june   to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  the primary reason for the increase was the improving efficiencies that come with scale arising from the integration of the acquisitions the company has completed 
as mentioned previously  the acquisition of integrail and the start up of the mail order facility had the impact of reducing profitability in the year ended june  ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization increased by approximately million or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the primary factor for the increase was the approximate million increase in operating income described above 
in addition  there was an approximate  increase in depreciation and amortization and an approximate  increase in other intangible amortization related to the company s acquisitions 
see fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  the effective tax rate increased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the increase stemmed primarily from an increase in the state tax rate as more of the company s income has been allocated to higher taxed states 
net income for the fiscal year ended june  was approximately million as compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   a increase 
earnings per diluted share increased by  to for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  of the increase  million  or was due to the inclusion of revenues from centrus  subsequent to january  pmp accounted for another million  or  of the increase since it was acquired on march  and included a full fiscal year in compared to less than four months in the fiscal year ended june  another million of the increase was due to revenues related to new sponsors or new services offered during fiscal the majority of the balance of the year over year increase was due primarily to increased revenues from other existing sponsors as a result of several factors including higher charges relating to increased cost of pharmaceuticals  new drugs  plan participant growth  and an increase in the average number of claims per plan participant 
two other factors affecting the year over year increase were rebates payable to the company s sponsors increased by for the twelve months ended june  as compared to the twelve months ended june  since these rebates are treated as a reduction in revenues this led to a reduction in the overall year over year revenue increase 
secondly  there were certain contracts during fiscal year that the company recognized on a net revenue basis 
there were no contracts during the twelve months ended june  that the company recognized on the net revenue basis 
the specific terms of the contracts that health card enters into with its sponsors will determine whether health card recognizes the gross revenue related to the cost of the prescriptions filled 
in certain limited cases  the company has not recognized the gross revenue or cost related to prescriptions filled for a specific sponsor 
this has no impact on the company s gross profit since neither the revenue nor the related cost of the prescriptions is recorded 
finally  revenues for the twelve months ended june  were negatively impacted by a reduction in revenues of  that arose when the company settled certain fees due from a major sponsor related to a capitation arrangement for calendar year cost of claims increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  centrus accounted for million  or of the increase 
pmp accounted for another million  or of the increase 
the balance of the increase is related to the increased revenue as described above 
an increase of million  million of which is related to centrus  in gross rebates received  which is treated as a reduction in cost of claims  for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the fiscal year ended june  led to a reduction in the year over year increase 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of claims increased from to for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the increase relates primarily to the higher cost of claims on the centrus book of business  which serves managed care clients primarily 
industry wide  managed care clients have a greater cost of claims  and consequently a lower gross margin  than other types of business in the pbm industry 
centrus cost of claims for the fiscal year ended june  ran about percentage points greater than the rest of the company s business  and since centrus accounted for of the company s revenue in the fiscal year  this impacted the overall cost of claims percentage 
gross profit increased from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june   a million  or  increase 
in addition  to the revenue volume increase  centrus accounted for million  or  of the increase 
pmp accounted for another million  or  of the increase 
the increase in rebates and administrative fees related to the collection of rebates after accounting for the amount of rebates that are shared with sponsors  accounted for another million  or 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenue  declined from to for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the decrease year over year is again principally related to the lower margins achieved by centrus 
the company has also seen a decline in profit margins due to competitive pressures 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  which include amounts charged by affiliates  increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  approximately of the increase  or million  was related to the acquisition of centrus 
there were also year over year increases in the following areas i an approximate  increase in expenditures related to increases in compensation and benefits  primarily associated with new employees including senior management  ii an approximate  increase in depreciation and amortization expenses related to increased hardware procurement and software development in prior periods  iii an approximate  increase in the use of outside consultants primarily to update the company s information technology infrastructure  and iv an approximate  increase in commission expense related to the increase in new revenues not related to the acquisitions 
partially offsetting these increases were i a reduction of approximately  related to actual payments made and or reserves accrued during the fiscal year ended june   but not the fiscal year ended june  related to the following matters a the settlement of the west contra costa lawsuit see note to the consolidated financial statements that comprise item hereof  b the reconciliation and settlement of amounts due to a former major sponsor see note to the consolidated financial statements  and c the settlement  in april of  of a certain patent infringement litigation involving the use by the company of certain pbm information technology systems  ii the reduction in general and administrative expenses charged by affiliates described below  and iii an approximate  decrease in intangible amortization due to the adoption of sfas per sfas  the company no longer amortizes goodwill as of july  see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
general and administrative expenses charged by affiliates decreased approximately million  or  year over year from million to million for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the company has eliminated most of the related party transactions effective january  the majority of the decrease related to reduced information technology services and management and consulting services procured from affiliated companies 
the hiring of full time employees and the use of outside consultants replaced the use of affiliated companies to update the information technology infrastructure 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue improved from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  this improvement stems from the continued growth of the company due to improving efficiencies with scale 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company recognized other income  net  of approximately  for the fiscal year ended june   the company incurred other expense  net  of approximately  the components of the approximate  increase in net expense were an approximate  increase in interest expense  an approximate  decrease in interest income  and an approximate  gain on sold assets during the fiscal year ended june  the primary reasons for the net increase in expense were the interest expense incurred on the company s revolving credit facility and on the note offering during the fiscal year ended june  to finance the acquisition of centrus see item  description of business recent acquisitions  and note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
partially offsetting the increase in interest expense was the approximate  deferred gain during the fiscal year ended june  on the sale of assets related to a sale leaseback transaction 
see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
income before the provision for income taxes increased approximately million  or  from approximately million  for the fiscal year ended june   to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  the primary reason for the increase was the improving efficiencies that come with scale 
for the fiscal year ended june  revenues increased over the fiscal year ended june   while selling  general  and administrative expenses increased only 
in addition  while gross margin percentages declined year over year due to the acquisition of centrus  the gross profit dollars increased by 
these factors contributed to the marked improvement in profitability 
ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization increased by approximately million or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the primary factor for the increase was the approximate million increase in operating income described above 
in addition  there was an approximate  increase in depreciation and amortization  including centrus 
this increase was partially offset by an approximate  decrease in goodwill and other intangibles amortization 
see chart below 
the effective tax rate decreased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease stemmed primarily from a reduction in non deductible goodwill amortization 
net income for the fiscal year ended june  was approximately million as compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   a increase 
earnings per diluted share increased by  to for the fiscal year ended june  the company has acquired four companies in the last three years 
in addition  the company has made  in prior years  significant information technology infrastructure investments in terms of purchased hardware and internally developed software 
consequently  there is a significant amount of depreciation and amortization that flows through the company s current financial statements related to these investments 
therefore  the company believes that ebitda is an important measure of its current financial performance 
ebitda is presented as net income plus the provision for income taxes  other expenses  net  and depreciation and amortization 
while ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  it is provided as information for certain investors for analysis purposes for two reasons it excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization related to prior investments and these items are not controllable in the current period 
ebitda is not meant to be considered a substitute or replacement for net income as prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
ebitda is calculated as follows year ended june  net income    provision for income taxes   other income expense  net depreciation   amortization    ebitda    liquidity and capital resources the company s primary cash requirements are for capital expenditures and operating expenses  including cost of pharmaceuticals  software and hardware upgrades and the funding of accounts receivable 
effective july  the company requires cash to carry inventory in its mail order facility and specialty pharmacy 
the company also requires cash for potential acquisitions of other pharmacy benefit management companies or of companies providing related services 
as of june   the company had a working capital deficit of million as compared to a working capital deficit of million as of june  the primary reason for the improvement in working capital was the profitability generated by the company during the fiscal year ended june  the company has now acquired four companies since july and a fifth in july utilizing primarily cash 
this has had the effect of increasing the company s working capital deficits until sufficient profitability is generated to pay back the cost of the acquisitions 
in addition  the company s revolving credit facility is treated all as a short term liability per generally accepted accounting principles even though its terms do not expire until january net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
one factor leading to the million increase in cash provided by operations was the million of incremental net income generated during the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the fiscal year ended june  another factor in the increase in cash was the changes in accounts receivables and payables during the two years 
for the year ended june  accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by million while receivables increased by million  providing million of cash 
for the year ended june   accounts payable increased by million while receivables decreased by million generating million of cash 
thus  million more cash was provided by operations from changes in receivables and payables during the fiscal year ended june  as compared to june  historically  the timing of the company s accounts receivable and accounts payable has generally been a net source of cash from operating activities 
this is the result of the terms of trade in place with plan sponsors on the one hand  and the company s pharmacy network on the other hand 
these terms generally lead to the company s payments to participating pharmacies being slower than its corresponding collections from plan sponsors 
the company believes that this situation is not unusual in the pharmacy benefit management industry and expects to operate on similar terms for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that such terms of trade will continue in the future and  if they were to change materially  the company could require additional working capital financing 
the company has put in place a million revolving credit facility for acquisitions and working capital financing 
however  if such terms of trade were to change materially  and or if the company were unable to obtain additional working capital financing  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  the primary differences in the two periods were the acquisition of centrus for million in the year ended june   and the acquisition of integrail in the year ended june  the net cash outlay for integrail was  representing the initial payment of  plus  of related expenses 
no cash was assumed in the acquisition 
during the year ended june  the company borrowed a net of approximately million under its revolving credit facility 
these funds were primarily utilized to repay the principal balance of the convertible notes  which had been put in place to acquire centrus  which has had the effect of significantly reducing the interest expense that the company incurs 
the company also paid million towards its outstanding capital lease and other debt obligations during the fiscal year ended june  the company has entered into various capital lease transactions for hardware and software 
the company has also assumed various capital leases through its acquisitions 
the principal balance of all capital leases as of june  was approximately  the company has entered into various real estate operating leases with both related and unrelated parties 
the company has entered into various operating leases with unrelated third parties for office equipment 
these leases have different payment terms and expirations dates 
the company also entered into a sale leaseback operating lease of certain fixed assets principally computer hardware and externally developed software with an affiliate of the company s vice chairman 
see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof for a further description of these various leases 
on january   the company entered into a million revolving credit facility  details of which are set forth in item above and in note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
borrowings of million under the facility were used to finance part of the purchase price of the company s acquisition of centrus 
the facility contains various covenants that  among other things  require the company to maintain certain financial ratios  as defined in the agreements governing the facility 
as of september   approximately million was outstanding under the facility  and the company was in compliance with its financial ratios covenants 
the total future payments under these contractual obligations as of june  is as follows payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands less than after total year years years years long term debt   capital lease obligations operating leases      sale leaseback total contractual cash obligations      the members of pmp are eligible to receive additional consideration of up to  if certain pmp clients are retained over the first three years after acquisition 
these targets were not met in the first two years so no additional consideration was due and payable 
it is the company s expectations that these amounts will not be earned in the third year either as the identified clients were not generally retained directly  although they were replaced 
the shareholders of centrus are eligible to receive additional consideration of up to  payable over three years  if certain financial targets are met over the first two years 
the financial performance targets were achieved during the first year and million has been earned 
of this amount  million was paid in may and another million will be paid in may the sellers of integrail are eligible to receive from monies put in escrow up to  if certain operational milestones are achieved over the first twelve months 
in february  the company entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated party for computer software products and professional services 
the agreement required the company to pay an initial license fee 
in addition  if certain milestones are met based on the number of processed claims  as defined in the agreement  the initial license fee increases in specified increments 
to date  four such milestones have been met  resulting in a increase in the license fee 
the agreement also provides for the annual payment of a fee for maintenance and updating services equal to of the initial license fee  as defined 
it is anticipated that  based on internal growth and the centrus acquisition  that the last milestone will be met 
if the remaining milestone is reached  the cash outlay by the company would be  the company anticipates that current cash positions  after its five acquisitions and the repayment of certain affiliate and shareholder debt  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy the company s contemplated cash requirements for at least months 
this is based upon current levels of capital expenditures  anticipated inventory levels and anticipated operating results for the next months 
however  it is one of the company s stated goals to acquire other pharmacy benefit management companies and companies providing related services  evidenced by the five acquired since july this will require cash and depending on the company s evaluation of future acquisitions  additional cash may be required 
in addition  the company is completing the build out of its mail order facility in florida which will require cash to build out the facility and to acquire inventory 
in the event that the company s plans change or its assumptions prove to be inaccurate  or the proceeds from the facility prove to be insufficient to fund operations and acquisitions  the company could be required to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
there can be no assurance that such financing could be obtained at rates or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
other matters inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on health card s net income 
subsequent events on july   the company entered into a stock purchase agreement with portland professional pharmacy pprx  professional pharmacy associates prxa  and together with pprx  ppp and the individual shareholders the ppp shareholders to purchase all of the shares of ppp for  the ppp acquisition 
in addition  the company agreed to pay to the ppp shareholders up to  over a three year period if the ppp business achieved certain financial targets 
ppp provides specialty pharmacy services in a broad range of areas  including women s health  pediatric care  men s health and transplant 
funds for the ppp acquisition were supplied by the company s revolving credit facility 
in connection with the ppp acquisition  several members of ppp s management team have joined the company as employees  and have been granted stock options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock  under the company s stock option plan  as amended 
as of august   the company s wholly owned subsidiary  ascend specialty pharmacy services  inc ascend assumed all of the shares of ppp 
each of prxa and pprx continues to operate under their respective names  as subsidiaries of ascend  in the state of maine 
the company intends to position ascend as a preferred provider with ppp s target markets while focusing on the extension of their specialty services to the company s pbm division 
critical accounting policies and estimates general health card s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon health card s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires health card to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  these estimates and judgments also effect related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  health card evaluates its estimates  including those related to rebate income  bad debt  intangible assets  income taxes and financing operations 
health card bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others revenue recognition the company has historically entered into two types of arrangements for the payment of administrative fees fee for service per claim charges and capitation per member per month charges 
under the fee for service arrangement  the company is paid by its sponsors for the company s contractually agreed upon rates based upon actual claims adjudicated plus a fixed transaction fee 
under the capitation arrangement  the fee is based on the number of participants per month  the company pays for the cost of prescriptions filled and thus shares the risk of operating profit or loss with these plans 
since january   all services have been provided on a fee for service basis only 
revenue under the fee for service arrangement is recognized when the claims are adjudicated 
included as revenue are the company s administrative fees  and charges relating to pharmaceuticals dispensed by the company s network of pharmacies 
revenue is reduced by the amount of rebates paid to the company s sponsors 
the specific terms of the contracts that health card enters into with its sponsors will determine whether health card recognizes the gross revenue related to the cost of the prescriptions filled 
in certain cases  the company has not recognized the gross revenue or cost related to prescriptions filled for a specific sponsor 
this has no impact on the company s gross profit since neither the revenue nor the related cost of the prescriptions is recorded 
rebates are recognized when the company is entitled to them in accordance with the terms of its arrangements with drug manufacturers  third party rebate administrators  and sponsors  and when the amount of the rebates is determinable 
the company records the gross rebate receivable and the appropriate payable to the sponsors based on estimates  which are subject to final settlement 
the estimates are based upon the claims submitted and the company s rebate experience  and are adjusted as additional information becomes available 
bad debt health card maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the liability of its sponsors to make required payments 
if the financial condition of health card s sponsors were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
deferred taxes health card periodically considers whether or not it should record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while health card has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event health card were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should health card determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
goodwill and intangible impairment in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on july  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues on a periodic basis thereafter 
during the year ended june   the company did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets
