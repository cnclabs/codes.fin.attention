the not for profit entity used proceeds from contract revenue bonds issued through the maricopa county industrial development authority to purchase the facility from csc 
neither csc nor the state of arizona is obligated to repay the bonds 
the bond payments are payable exclusively from the revenue generated by the facility s operations  or from the disposition of the facility 
however  due to certain guarantee obligations of the company with respect to the purchase of the facility by the state from the not for profit entity  and applicable generally accepted accounting principles  the company was not permitted to record the transaction as a sale for accounting purposes 
therefore  the assets and associated liabilities remain on the financial statements of the company 
legal title to the property is held by the not for profit entity 
the ownership of the phoenix  arizona facility will eventually be passed to the state of arizona over the passage of time  or when the state of arizona exercises its option to purchase the facility 
the company s non recourse liability with respect to the debt service payments is million as of december   and matures in  or upon the state of arizona s exercise of its option to purchase the facility

see safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of on page of this annual report on form k 
the factors listed below represent certain important risks the company believes could cause such results to differ and are not intended to represent a complete list of the general or specific risks that may affect the company 
it should be recognized that other risks may be significant  presently or in the future  and the risks set forth below may affect the company to a greater extent than indicated 
decreases in occupancy levels at our facilities or rising costs may have a material adverse effect on our business 
while the non personnel cost structures of the facilities we operate are relatively fixed  a substantial portion of our revenues are generated under facility management contracts with government agencies that specify a net rate per day per inmate or a per diem rate  with no minimum guaranteed occupancy levels 
under this per diem rate structure  a decrease in occupancy levels may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we are dependent upon the governmental agencies with which we have management contracts to provide inmates for  and maintain the occupancy level of  our managed facilities 
we cannot control those occupancy levels 
in addition  our ability to estimate and control our costs with respect to all of these contracts is critical to our profitability 
the non renewal or termination of our facility management contracts  which generally range from one to three years  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as is typical in our industry  our facility management contracts are short term  generally ranging from one to three years  with renewal or extension options as well as termination for convenience clauses in favor of the contracting governmental agency 
many ysi contracts renew annually 
additionally  the company received approximately of its consolidated revenue from three agencies maryland and florida departments of juvenile justice  and the texas department of criminal justice 
our facility management contracts may not be renewed or our customers may terminate such contracts in accordance with their right to do so 
the non renewal or termination of any of these contracts could materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity  including our ability to secure new facility management contracts from others 
of the multi year contracts in place as of december   seven contracts representing approximately  beds are up for renewal in three contracts representing beds have been awarded to other providers  beginning in april a contracting governmental agency often has a right to terminate a facility contract with or without cause by giving us adequate notice 
at times a contracting government agency may notify us that we are not in compliance with certain provisions of a facility contract 
our failure to cure any such noncompliance could result in termination of the facility contract  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
if a governmental agency does not receive necessary appropriations  it could terminate its contract or reduce the management fee payable to us 
even if funds are appropriated  delays in payments may occur which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we currently lease many of the facilities that we manage 
if a management contract for a leased facility were terminated  we would continue to be obligated to make lease payments until the lease expires 
our ability to secure new contracts to develop and manage correctional detention facilities depends on many factors we cannot control 
our growth is generally dependent upon our ability to obtain new contracts to develop and manage new correctional and detention facilities 
this depends on a number of factors we cannot control  including crime rates and sentencing patterns in various jurisdictions and acceptance of privatization 
certain jurisdictions recently have required successful bidders to make a significant capital investment in connection with the financing of a particular project  a trend which will require the combined company to have sufficient capital resources to compete effectively 
we may not be able to obtain these capital resources when needed 
future acquisitions may involve special risks  including possible adverse short term effects on our operating results  diversion of management s attention from existing business  dependence on key personnel  unanticipated liabilities and costs of amortization of intangible assets 
any of these risks could materially adversely affect us 
the company also intends to grow through selective acquisitions of companies and individual facilities although there are no current plans or agreements to acquire any other companies 
we may not be able to identify or acquire any new companies or facilities and we may not be able to profitably manage acquired operations 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including possible adverse short term effects on our operating results  diversion of management s attention from existing business  dependence on retaining  hiring and training key personnel  risks associated with unanticipated liabilities  and the costs of amortization of acquired intangible assets  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
public resistance to privatization of correctional and detention facilities could result in our inability to obtain new contracts or the loss of existing contracts 
the movement toward privatization of correctional and detention facilities has encountered resistance from certain groups  such as labor unions and others that believe that correctional and detention facility operations should only be conducted by governmental agencies 
political changes or changes in attitudes toward private correctional and detention facilities management in any market in which we will operate could result in significant changes to the previous acceptance of privatization in such market and the subsequent loss of facility management contracts 
further  some sectors of the federal government and some state and local governments are not legally permitted to delegate their traditional operating responsibilities for correctional and detention facilities to private companies 
opposition to facility location may adversely impact the company s ability to develop sites for new facility locations 
the company s success in opening new facilities is dependent in part upon its ability to obtain facility sites that can be leased or acquired on economically favorable terms 
some locations may be in or near populous areas and  therefore  may generate legal action or other forms of opposition from residents in areas surrounding a proposed site 
certain facilities are already located in or adjacent to such areas and  in one instance  the company abandoned its plan to expand a facility after consulting with community leaders who raised concerns about the expansion 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to open new facilities or expand existing facilities in any particular location 
our failure to comply with unique governmental regulation could result in material penalties or non renewal or termination of our facility management contracts 
the industry in which we operate is subject to extensive federal  state and local regulations  including education  health care and safety regulations  which are administered by many regulatory authorities 
some of the regulations are unique to our industry  and the combination of regulations we face is unique 
we may not always successfully comply with these regulations  and failure to comply can result in material penalties or non renewal or termination of our facility management contracts 
our contracts typically include extensive reporting requirements  and supervision and on site monitoring by representatives of the contracting governmental agencies 
corrections officers and youth care workers are customarily required to meet certain training standards and  in some instances  facility personnel are required to be licensed and subject to background investigation 
certain jurisdictions also require us to award subcontracts on a competitive basis or to subcontract with businesses owned by members of minority groups 
our businesses also are subject to operational and financial audits by the governmental agencies with which we have contracts 
the outcomes of these audits could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
disturbances at one or more of our facilities could result in closure of these facilities by the relevant governmental entities and a loss of our contracts to manage these facilities 
an escape  riot or other disturbance at one of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
among other things  the adverse publicity generated as a result of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain an existing contract or obtain future ones 
in addition  if such an event occurs  there is a possibility that the facility where the event occurred may be shut down by the relevant governmental entity 
a closure of any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
insurance coverage may become inadequate or unavailable to cover potential liability related to management of correctional and detention facilities or its costs may adversely affect results of operations 
our management of correctional and detention facilities exposes us to potential third party claims or litigation by prisoners or other persons for personal injury or other damages  including damages resulting from contact with our facilities  programs  personnel or students including students who leave our facilities without our authorization and cause bodily injury or property damage 
currently  we are subject to actions initiated by former employees  inmates and detainees alleging assault  sexual harassment  personal injury  property damage  and other injuries 
in addition  our management contracts generally require us to indemnify the governmental agency against any damages to which the governmental agency may be subject in connection with such claims or litigation 
we maintain insurance programs that provide coverage for certain liability risks faced by us  including personal injury  bodily injury  death or property damage to a third party where we are found to be negligent 
there is no assurance  however  that our insurance will be adequate to cover potential third party claims 
in addition  we are unable to secure insurance for some unique business risks  which may include  but not be limited to  some types of punitive damages in states where it is prohibited by law 
committed offenders often seek redress in federal courts pursuant to federal civil rights statutes for alleged violations of their constitutional rights caused by the overall condition of their confinement or by specific conditions or incidents 
we may be subject to liability if any such claim or proceeding is made or instituted against us or the state with which we contract or subcontract 
the company continues to incur increased costs for insurance 
workers compensation and general liability insurance represent significant costs to the company 
staff recruitment difficulties may impact operations 
many of our facilities are located in areas where there are smaller populations and or where there are more jobs than available workers 
our choice of employees is further limited by our drug free workplace status  and licensure and other policy prohibitions against hiring individuals with past criminal histories 
however  many of our contracts require the company to have certain numbers and certain types of employees on duty at the facility at all times 
although the company makes rigorous efforts to recruit and retain a sufficient work force  it is sometimes unable to achieve adequate staffing without significant overtime expense 
this additional expense may adversely effect the company s results 
item a
