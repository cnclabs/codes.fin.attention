in some cases  forward looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as may  will  expects  should  believes  plans  anticipates  estimates  predicts  potential  continue  or other words of similar meaning 
forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in  or implied by  the forward looking statements 
readers should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which reflect management s opinion only as of the date on which they were made 
except as required by law  the company disclaims any obligation to review or update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances as they occur 
readers should also carefully review any risk factors described in company reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
various statements made in this report concerning the manner in which the company intends to conduct its future operations  and potential trends that may impact future results of operations  are forward looking statements 
the company may be unable to realize its plans and objectives due to various important factors  including  but not limited to  the factors described below 
these and other factors are more fully discussed elsewhere in this report 
the company has recognized substantial loan losses in past years  principally related to loans made under the direction of prior management 
the volume of classified loans remains high relative to the company s peers 
while the company has created what it believes are appropriate loan loss reserves  the company could incur significant additional loan losses in future periods  particularly if general economic conditions or conditions in particular industries in which its loans are concentrated deteriorate 
the company is subject to increasingly vigorous and intense competition from other banking institutions and from various financial institutions and other nonbank or non regulated companies or firms that engage in similar activities 
many of these institutions have significantly greater resources than the company 
certain credit  market  operational  liquidity and interest rate risks associated with the company s business operations as well as changes in business and economic conditions  competition  fiscal and monetary policies and legislation could impact the future operations and performance of the company 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies belmont s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosure presented in the other financial statement notes and in management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of deferred federal tax assets to be accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents nearly half of the assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
the valuation of deferred federal tax assets represents management s estimate that the company will have sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize these assets 
the deferred federal tax assets at december  are largely comprised of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to future periods 
the company s ability to use these assets is based on its ability to generate taxable income in sufficient amounts to use the operating losses and tax credits before the applicable expiration dates 
forecasting taxable income in future periods requires the use of estimates for loan  investment and deposit levels  loan losses  noninterest income and expenses  the interest rates applicable to earning assets and interest paying liabilities  and unforeseen events that could have a material impact on the company s earnings prospects 
actual results in future periods may vary significantly from the forecasts prepared as of the date of the financial statements

net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities  and interest expense paid on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates  changes in interest rates and by changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the relative performance of the lending and deposit raising functions is frequently measured by two statistics net interest margin and net interest rate spread 
the net interest margin is determined by dividing fully taxable equivalent net interest income by average interest earning assets 
the net interest rate spread is the difference between the average fully taxable equivalent yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is generally greater than the net interest rate spread due to the

credit evaluations of borrowers are performed to ensure that loans are granted on a sound basis 
in addition  care is taken to minimize risk by diversifying among industries 
the bank has certain concentrations of credit  which are more fully described in note of the company s financial statements beginning on page f management regularly monitors credit risk through the periodic review of individual credits to ensure compliance with policies and procedures 
adequate collateralization  contractual guarantees  and compensating balances are also utilized by management to mitigate risk 

table of contents management determines the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses by regularly evaluating the quality of the loan portfolio 
the allowance is allocated to specific loans that exhibit above average credit loss potential based upon their payment history and the borrowers financial conditions 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated based on an assessment of the probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
management maintains a watch list of substandard loans for monthly review 
although these loans may not be delinquent and may be adequately secured  management believes that due to location  size  or past payment history  it is necessary to monitor these loans regularly 
the evaluation of each element and the overall allowance are based on the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio and include an assessment of individual problem loans  actual loss experience  current economic events in specific industries and geographical areas  including unemployment levels  and other pertinent factors  including regulatory guidance and general economic conditions 
while management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on information currently available  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions and delinquencies or loss rates 
in addition  the allowance for loan losses is periodically reviewed by the bank regulatory agencies as an integral part of their examination process 
based on their review  the agencies may require the company to adjust the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their review 
the allowance for loan losses totaled  or of total loans at december  at the end of the previous year  the allowance for loan losses was  or of total loans 
a reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the amount of  was recorded during and is reflected as a negative loan loss provision 
similarly  during the allowance for loan losses was reduced by  during and  improvements to the bank s classifed loans and a reduction in principal from the receipt of liquidation proceeds of a large commercial borrower enabled the bank to reduce the allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses recorded during was  during the second quarter of  the company charged off approximately million in loans that  during previous reporting periods  had specific reserves through an allocation of the allowance for loan loss 
the bank recorded charge offs during and principally related to schwartz homes  inc and retail customers of that business 
schwartz homes  inc was placed into bankruptcy in june and was subsequently liquidated 
during  the bank received settlement proceeds from the bankruptcy of million of which million was applied to the remaining credit exposure for this relationship  million was recorded as recoveries in the allowance for loan losses  and the remainder was recorded as a recovery of legal expenses 
of the million in net charge offs for the year ended december   were related to the schwartz homes loan relationship

table of contents the unallocated portion of the allowance reflects estimated probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates  and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors

table of contents change in average deposit sources to to to demand interest bearing checking savings other time certificates  and over total the decline in average deposits during to is attributable to a number of factors 
the negative publicity resulting from the bank s loan losses had an adverse impact on bank deposits 
in addition  the bank actively reduced deposits to shrink its asset size thereby reducing the amount of capital required to meet the terms of its regulatory agreements 
deposit trends increased during the last half of and throughout after the bank completed its recapitalization plan 
during  average deposits declined million 
throughout  the bank did not aggressively price offered rates on time deposits relative to its competitors due to the available yields on investment alternatives and low loan demand 
also  the mix of deposits shifted from time to savings deposits as depositors were reluctant to extend maturities on time deposits due to low interest rates 
higher interest rates will likely result in a shift in deposits from savings to time deposits 
deferred federal tax assets deferred federal tax assets declined from approximately million at december  to million at december  the deferred federal tax assets include significant balances related to tax loss carryforwards and tax credits carryforwards 
the gross legal settlements received during generated taxable income of approximately million that utilized a portion of the tax loss carryforwards contributing to the reduction of the deferred federal tax asset balance 
also contributing to the decline in net deferred tax assets was the improvement in the estimated market value of securities available for sale 
since december   the tax effect of the change in unrealized gains and losses on the portfolio has reduced deferred tax assets by million because the estimated market value of the portfolio compared to amortized cost had improved by million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company eliminated a million valuation allowance previously established at the end of against the carrying value of its deferred tax assets 
this reversal increased the balance of deferred federal tax assets and reduced federal tax expense by million 
a number of factors contributed to management s estimate that the valuation allowance was no longer required 
these factors included the reduction in tax exempt bonds that should improve taxable income in future periods  the elimination of the regulatory agreements that restricted the company s operation and increased its operating costs  and the conclusion of costly litigation 
other assets other assets declined from million at december  to million at december  this change was principally the result of the liquidation and payout of assets funding certain deferred compensation plans as the result of the comprehensive legal settlements previously discussed 

table of contents other liabilities other liabilities declined from million at december  to million at december  other liabilities include amounts for various accrued expenses  accounts payable  funds owed for securities traded but not yet settled  and obligations related to compensation plans 
the decline in other liabilities for the comparative periods presented was due to lower legal expense accruals and the termination of certain deferred compensation plans as a result of the comprehensive legal settlements previously discussed 
borrowings other sources of funds for the company include short term repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank borrowings 
liquidity and capital resources effective liquidity management involves ensuring that the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as the operating needs of the company  are met 
funds are available through the operation of bnb s branch banking network that gathers demand and retail time deposits 
bnb also acquires funds through repurchase agreements and overnight federal funds that provide additional sources of liquidity 
total deposits decreased million from the end of to average deposits decreased million  or  during compared to as a consequence of low interest rates  loan refinance activity  calls on investment securities and investment sales provided the company with a relatively large liquidity position throughout liquidity may be impacted by the ability of the company to generate future earnings 
the bank also has lines of credit with various correspondent banks totaling  that may be used as an alternative funding source  none of these lines were drawn upon at december  the bank has an unused credit line with the federal home loan bank for million 
all borrowings at the federal home loan bank are subject to eligible collateral requirements 
the main source of liquidity for the parent company is dividends from the bank 
at december   the parent had cash and marketable securities with an estimated fair value of million 
the parent company does not have any debt to third parties 
management believes sufficient liquidity is currently available to meet estimated short term and long term funding needs for the bank and the parent company

the federal reserve board has adopted risk based capital guidelines that assign risk weightings to assets and off balance sheet items 
the guidelines also define and set minimum capital requirements risk based capital ratios 
bank holding companies are required to have core capital tier of at least of risk weighted assets and total capital of of risk weighted assets 
tier capital consists principally of shareholders equity less goodwill  and may include a portion of deferred tax assets 
however  presently none of the company s deferred tax assets are included as tier capital

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
the company s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk results from timing differences in the repricing of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  changes in relationships between rate indices and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options 
the asset liability management committee alco meets regularly to review the interest rate sensitivity position of the company and to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
the goal of asset liability management is to maximize net interest income and the net value of the company s future cash flows within the interest rate risk limits established by the board of directors 
interest rate risk is monitored primarily through the use of two complementary measures earnings simulation modeling and net present value estimation 
while each of these interest rate risk measurements has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the company 
the key assumptions underlying these measures are periodically reviewed by alco 
the earnings simulation model forecasts the effects on income under a variety of scenarios 
this model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from historical analysis and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
securities portfolio maturities and prepayments are assumed to be reinvested in similar instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry median estimates of prepayment speeds 
based on the earnings simulation model  changes in net interest income were projected as follows given a parallel shift in the yield curve one year net interest income simulation projection down basis points up basis points up basis points due to the current low interest rate environment  a decline of basis points is not presented 
the net present value estimation npv measure is used for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet that might not be taken into account in the earnings simulation model due to the shorter time horizon used by that model 
the npv of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
the npv measure also assumes a static balance sheet  versus the growth assumptions that are incorporated into the earnings simulation measure and an unlimited time horizon instead of the one year horizon applied in the earnings simulation 
as with earnings simulation modeling  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are important to npv analysis 
the estimated decline in the present value of equity as a percentage of the total market value of equity at december  would be given a basis point increase in interest rates
