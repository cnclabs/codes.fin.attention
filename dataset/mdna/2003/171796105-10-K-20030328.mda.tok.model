item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as 
table of contents a result of many factors  including but not limited to those set forth under factors that could affect future results and elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products based on our proprietary orasolv and durasolv fast dissolve technologies 
we currently manufacture six pharmaceutical brands utilizing our fast dissolve technologies three prescription and three over the counter brands 
the three over the counter brands are triaminic softchews for novartis  tempra firstabs for a canadian affiliate of bristol myers squibb and alavert for wyeth 
the three prescription brands are astrazeneca s zomig zmt and its equivalent for markets outside the us  remeron soltab for organon and nulev for schwarz pharma 
we are currently developing other oral drug delivery technologies for ourselves and others 
we operate within a single business segment  the development and manufacture of fast dissolve and enhanced absorption oral drug delivery systems 
our revenues are comprised of three components  including net sales of products we manufacture for pharmaceutical companies using our proprietary fast dissolve technologies  product development fees and licensing revenues for development activities we conduct through collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical companies  and royalties on the sales of products we manufacture  which are sold by pharmaceutical companies under licenses from us 
revenues from product sales and from royalties will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year depending on  among other factors  demand by consumers for the products we produce  new product introductions  the seasonal nature of some of the products we produce to treat seasonal ailments  pharmaceutical company ordering patterns and our production schedules 
revenues from product development fees and licensing revenue will fluctuate depending on  among other factors  the number of new collaborative agreements that we enter into  the number and timing of product development milestones that we achieve under collaborative agreements and the level of our development activity conducted for pharmaceutical companies 
components of revenue  expenses  operating income  other income  tax benefits and net income as a percentage of total operating revenue for the years ending december net sales product development fees licensing revenues royalty revenues cost of goods sold research product development expense selling  general administrative expense operating income other income  net tax benefit net income critical accounting policies and estimates general the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from our business activities are recognized from net sales of manufactured products upon shipment  from product development fees as the contracted services are rendered  from product development milestones upon completion of milestones  from up front product development license fees as fees are amortized over the expected development term of the proposed products  and from royalties on the sales of products that we manufacture  which are sold by pharmaceutical companies under license from us 
the determination of sab criteria and for each source of revenue is based on our judgments regarding the fixed nature and collectibility of each source of revenue 
revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected should changes in conditions cause us to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions 
deferred taxes the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the united states  based on estimates and assumptions 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the requirements for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would decrease net income in the period such determination is made 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the requirements for a valuation allowance 
for the year ended december   we have recorded a million valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets of million  compared to a valuation allowance of million related to our net deferred tax assets of million for the year ended december  results of operations years ended december   and operating revenues 
our total operating revenues were million in  compared to million in and million in operating revenues from astrazeneca  organon and schwarz pharma  our three largest pharmaceutical company partners in  together represented approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
in  schwarz pharma replaced novartis as one of our three largest pharmaceutical company partners 
novartis accounted for approximately and of total operating revenues in and  respectively 
the increases in total operating revenues in each year were due to sequentially increasing development activity for new products that resulted in higher product development fees and licensing revenue  as well as sequentially increasing sales of products we manufacture and royalties on sales by our pharmaceutical company partners under license from us 
we are paid by our collaborative partners for the fast dissolve products that we manufacture and ship to them 
these activities resulted in net sales of fast dissolve products of million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase from to was primarily attributable to a net increase of million in shipments of branded prescription products  which was partially offset by a net reduction in shipments of over the counter products that was caused by a year over year drop off in shipments of triaminic softchews 
the million increase from to was attributable to higher levels of shipments of both our brand prescription and over the counter products 
in  net sales of fast dissolve products are expected to increase in the range of to from levels 

table of contents we are paid product development and licensing revenues for our activities performed under collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical companies 
these activities resulted in product development fees and licensing revenues of million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase from to was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of collaborative projects in our product development portfolio  which included the achievement of certain milestones for aventis and schwarz pharma 
the  increase from to was not significant  with similar levels of development activity for proposed new products as well as the achievement of certain milestones for astrazeneca  novartis and organon 
product development fees and licensing revenues include amortization of deferred revenue of   and million in  and  respectively 
in  product development fees and licensing revenues are expected to be slightly above levels 
we are paid royalties based on our collaborative partners sales of fast dissolve products developed and manufactured by cima 
our collaborative partners sales of cima manufactured fast dissolve products amounted to approximately million in  up from nearly million in and up from about million in as a result  we recognized royalties of million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase in royalties from to was attributable to strongly growing worldwide sales of fast dissolve versions of zomig and remeron soltab  as well as the us market introduction of alavert by wyeth late in the fourth quarter of the million increase in royalties from to was attributable to the us market launch of our first three branded prescription products  astrazeneca s zomig zmt  organon s remeron soltab and schwarz pharma s nulev 
in  we expect royalties to increase from to from levels  based on anticipated sales of cima fast dissolve products by our collaborative partners in the range of to million 
cost of goods sold 
we incurred cost of goods sold of million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase from to was primarily due to manufacturing more of our fast dissolve products  except for triaminic softchews  and from higher indirect labor costs associated with the expansion of our manufacturing and quality control infrastructures 
the million increase from to was primarily due to manufacturing higher levels of over the counter products  principally triaminic softchews  higher direct labor costs to staff multiple production lines for a multiple shift operation  and from higher depreciation costs associated with new manufacturing equipment 
research and product development expenses 
we incurred research and product development expenses of million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase from to was primarily due to an increase in the number of collaborative projects in our product development portfolio  including development activity for recent collaborative agreements with aventis  schering plough and schwarz pharma  higher payroll costs associated with increases in professional staffing levels  and higher depreciation costs associated with the newly renovated r d center 
the million increase from to was primarily due to increased development activity for astrazeneca  organon  novartis and schwarz pharma  as well as higher payroll costs associated with increases in professional staffing levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
we incurred selling  general and administrative expenses of million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase from to was primarily due to increased recruiting and relocation costs  corporate incentive payments and higher levels of staffing and consulting in support of our computer and information systems 
the increase from to was primarily due to marketing and related consulting costs associated with our business development efforts  higher payroll costs associated with increased professional staffing  and higher levels of staffing and consulting in support of our computer and information systems 
operating income 
we recognized operating income of million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase from to was primarily due to the growth in operating revenues as well as significantly higher gross profit margins of the fast dissolve product we manufacture for our collaborative partners 
the million increase from to was primarily due to the growth in operating revenues as well as nominally higher gross profit margins of the fast dissolve product we manufacture for our collaborative partners 
in  we expect operating income to be at least higher than the operating income recognized for due to anticipated operating revenues in the range of to million 

table of contents other income  net 
we recognized other income of million in  compared to million in and million in other income consists primarily of investment income on invested funds and gains or losses on asset dispositions 
the million decrease from to was primarily due to the lower interest rates on funds reinvested during the year 
the million increase from to was primarily due to the full year effect of investing the million cash proceeds from our november public offering 
in  we expect other income to decrease to under million primarily from the impact of lower interest rates on funds that we expect to reinvest during the year 
tax benefit 
we recognized a tax benefit  or negative tax expense  of million in  compared to a tax benefit of  in and no tax benefit expense in the million increase of tax benefit from to was due to the recognition of approximately million in tax credits related to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  which offset the tax expense we would otherwise incur 
the  increase of tax benefit from to was due to the recognition of approximately million in tax credits related to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  which offset the tax expense we would otherwise incur 
in  we expect to recognize our remaining tax benefits related to the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  which have a value of approximately million  and are expected to result in a full year effective tax rate in the range of to 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date primarily through private and public sales of equity securities and revenues from product sales  product development fees and licensing revenues and royalties 
working capital  which is defined as current assets less current liabilities  increased by million from million at december  to million at december  the increase was primarily due to million in net cash provided by operating activities and the sale or redemption of million of non current available for sale securities  partially offset by the use of million for capital expenditures and the use of million to repurchase approximately  shares of common stock 
we invest excess cash in interest bearing money market accounts and investment grade securities 
during  we plan to spend approximately to million  exclusive of potential capital expenditures to add capacity for the manufacture of products containing potent substances  to complete various improvements to our eden prairie manufacturing facility and brooklyn park r d center  including a second site of manufacturing 
our second manufacturing site in our brooklyn park facility will be equipped to provide bottling production line capabilities and is expected to be operational late in we also expect to substantially complete either the replacement or the addition of a production line in eden prairie for fast dissolve product requiring blister packaging 
in addition  we expect to fund additional product development activities related to our oravescent technology  which may include adding capacity for the manufacture of products containing potent substances  and to develop proprietary products using our orasolv and durasolv technologies 
we may also acquire technologies that complement our current portfolio of oral drug delivery technologies 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with expected revenues from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financings or from other sources 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all  or that any additional financing will not be dilutive 
factors that could affect future results certain statements made in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about our business and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully described below and elsewhere in this form k 
you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below  which are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties also may impair our business operations 

table of contents the loss of one of our top three major customers could reduce our revenues significantly 
revenues from astrazeneca  organon and schwarz pharma together represented approximately of our total operating revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the corresponding period in the loss of any one of these customers could cause our revenues to decrease significantly  resulting in losses from our operations 
if we cannot broaden our customer base  we will continue to depend on a few customers for the majority of our revenues 
we may be unable to negotiate favorable business terms with customers that represent a significant portion of our revenues 
if we cannot  our revenues and gross profits may not grow as expected and may be insufficient to allow us to achieve sustained profitability 
we rely on third parties to market  distribute and sell the products incorporating our drug delivery technologies  and those third parties may not perform  or the sales of those products may be affected by factors beyond the control of those third parties 
our pharmaceutical company partners market and sell the products we develop and manufacture 
if one or more of our pharmaceutical company partners fails to pursue the marketing of our products as planned  our revenues and gross profits may not reach our expectations  or may decline 
we often cannot control the timing and other aspects of the development of products incorporating our technologies because our pharmaceutical company partners may have priorities that differ from ours 
therefore  our commercialization of products under development may be delayed unexpectedly 
because we incorporate our drug delivery technologies into the oral dosage forms of products marketed and sold by our pharmaceutical company partners  we do not have a direct marketing channel to consumers for our drug delivery technologies 
the marketing organizations of our pharmaceutical company partners may be unsuccessful or they may assign a low level of priority to the marketing of our products 
further  they may discontinue marketing the products that incorporate our drug delivery technologies 
if marketing efforts for our products are not successful  our revenues may fail to grow as expected or may decline 
for the year ended december   net sales from manufacturing and royalties from our partners sales of our top three products accounted for approximately of our operating revenues 
our top three products are astrazeneca s zomig zmt and its equivalent for markets outside the us  organon s remeron soltab and its equivalent for markets outside the us  and wyeth s alavert 
we cannot be certain that these products will continue to be accepted in their markets 
specifically  the following factors  among others  could affect the level of market acceptance of remeron soltab and its non us equivalents  zomig zmt and its non us equivalents  and alavert the perception of the healthcare community of their safety and efficacy  both in an absolute sense and relative to that of competing products  unfavorable publicity regarding these products or similar products  product price relative to other competing products or treatments  changes in government and third party payor reimbursement policies and practices  and regulatory developments affecting the manufacture  marketing or use of these products 
if we do not enter into additional collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical companies  we may not be able to achieve sustained profitability 
we primarily depend upon collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical companies to develop  test and obtain regulatory approval for  and commercialize oral dosage forms of  active pharmaceutical ingredients using our drug delivery technologies 
the number of products that we successfully develop under these collaborative agreements will affect our revenues 
if we do not enter into additional agreements in the future  or if our current or future agreements do not result in successful marketing of our products  our revenues and gross profits may be insufficient to allow us to achieve sustained profitability 
we face additional risks related to our collaborative agreements  including the risks that any existing or future collaborative agreements may not result in additional commercial products  additional commercial products that we may develop may not be successful  we may not be able to meet the milestones established in our current or future collaborative agreements  we may not be able to successfully develop new drug delivery technologies that will be attractive in the future to potential pharmaceutical company partners  and our pharmaceutical company partners may exercise their rights to terminate their collaborative agreements with us 

table of contents if we cannot increase our production capacity  we may be unable to meet expected demand for our products  and we may lose revenues 
we must increase our production capacity to meet expected demand for our products 
we currently have two production lines for product requiring blister packaging  which collectively have an estimated annualized production capacity in excess of million tablets 
in  we plan to either replace the oldest of our two production lines or retain both of these production lines and add a third production line at our eden prairie facility  which is expected to be completed and commissioned in the first half of we also plan to add a production line for bottled product at our brooklyn park facility  which is expected to be completed and commissioned in the fourth quarter of we estimate that our total annualized capacity for the two production lines in eden prairie will increase from approximately million to more than million tablets  or to approximately billion tablets if we add the new production line to our two existing production lines 
the estimated total annualized capacity of the production line in brooklyn park will be approximately million bottled tablets 
if we are unable to increase our production capacity as scheduled or if our partners significantly increase their requirements for product deliveries prior to completing the scheduled increases in capacity  we may be required to allocate our production capacity until we have completed these capacity improvements 
if this should happen  we may lose revenues and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with our pharmaceutical company partners 
production lines in the pharmaceutical industry generally take to months to complete due to the long lead times required for precision production equipment to be manufactured and installed  as well as the required testing and validation process that must be completed once the equipment is installed 
we may not be able to increase our production capacity quickly enough to meet the requirements of our pharmaceutical company partners 
if we do not properly manage our growth  we may be unable to sustain the level of revenues we have attained or effectively pursue additional business opportunities 
our operating revenues increased for the year ended december   compared to an increase of for the year ended december   placing significant strain on our management  administrative and operational resources 
if we do not properly manage the growth we have recently experienced and expect in the future  our revenues may decline or we may be unable to pursue sources of additional revenues 
to properly manage our growth  we must  among other things  implement additional and improve existing administrative  financial and operational systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis 
we also need to expand our finance  administrative and operations staff 
we may not be able to complete the improvements to our systems  procedures and controls necessary to support our future operations in a timely manner 
we may not be able to hire  train  integrate  retain  motivate and manage required personnel and may not be able to successfully identify  manage and pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
improving our systems and increasing our staff will increase our operating expenses 
if we fail to generate additional revenue in excess of increased operating expenses in any fiscal period we may incur losses  or our losses may increase in that period 
sales of our pharmaceutical company partners products may decline as a result of competition from generic prescription products and regulatory actions that could switch a prescription product to an over the counter product  which may result in a decline in our revenues 
many of our pharmaceutical company partners face intense competition from manufacturers of generic drugs 
generic competition may reduce the demand and or price for our partners products 
products that our pharmaceutical company partners produce may also be subject to regulatory actions that result in prescription products becoming available to consumers over the counter 
such a change could also reduce the demand and or price for our partners products 
because we derive a significant portion of our revenue from manufacturing products for and receipt of royalties from our pharmaceutical company partners  a decline in the sales of products that we produce for our partners  whether as a result of the introduction of competitive generic products or other competitive factors  could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
in january  mylan laboratories and teva pharmaceutical industries announced that they received tentative approval from the fda to sell mirtazapine tablets  which are expected to be generic substitutes for organon s remeron standard tablets 
we developed and manufacture an orasolv formulation of remeron for organon 
in march  akzo nobel nv  organon s parent company  reported that organon sued seven generic pharmaceutical companies  including teva and mylan  for the infringement of organon s us patent for remeron mirtazapine standard tablets 
in may  organon announced that it sued barr laboratories  inc for infringing its us patent for remeron soltab mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets 
on december   a federal 
table of contents district court ruled that the generic version of mirtazapine developed by teva did not infringe organon s patent covering remeron 
as a result of this ruling  we expect that teva will launch its generic form of mirtazapine in the us market in we expect other generic manufacturers  including mylan laboratories  to launch their generic versions of mirtazapine  subject to fda approval  after teva s day marketing exclusivity period expires 
in addition  the us market launch of generic orally disintegrating mirtazapine tablets developed by barr laboratories is expected to occur after it receives fda approval 
although organon has appealed this court s ruling  it is unlikely that the appeals court will reverse or delay the trial court s ruling 
organon s market for remeron soltab may be affected negatively by the introduction of generic versions of standard or orally disintegrating mirtazapine tablets 
the introduction of these generic tablets could be expected to lower organon s pricing for remeron 
due to the large number of variables and high degree of uncertainty  we are unable to predict the timing of the market introduction of a generic orally disintegrating mirtazapine tablet or the effect that the introduction of generic mirtazapine may have on our business 
on january   kv pharmaceutical company announced that it will begin marketing the first product utilizing its oraquick fast dissolve technology 
hyoscyamine sulfate orally disintegrating tablets  mg  is a prescription anticholinergic antispasmodic product 
this product is expected to be equivalent to and substitutable for nulev  which we developed and manufacture for schwarz pharma 
due to the large number of variables  we are unable to predict the effect of such a product introduction by kv pharmaceutical on our business 
on january   andrx corporation and perrigo company announced that they have entered into a multi year agreement for andrx to supply perrigo with andrx s over the counter fast dissolve formulation of loratadine  which is expected to be equivalent to and substitutable for schering plough s claritin reditabs and wyeth s alavert 
we developed and manufacture alavert for wyeth 
andrx has received tentative fda approval of its abbreviated new drug application for a fast dissolve formulation of loratadine 
in february  wyeth received its second fda approval for a durasolv loratadine product  which is identical to alavert  but was initially intended for the prescription market 
we believe that wyeth s second fda approval of a durasolv loratadine product may prevent andrx from receiving final fda approval of its competitive fast dissolve formulation of loratadine  until at least days after wyeth s launch of alavert on december  due to the large number of variables  we are unable to predict the effect of perrigo s product introduction of a fast dissolve loratadine product on our business 
we may experience significant delays in expected product releases while we and our pharmaceutical company partners seek regulatory approvals for the products we develop and manufacture and  if either of us are not successful in obtaining the approvals  we may be unable to achieve our anticipated revenues and profits 
the federal government  principally the us food and drug administration  and state and local government agencies regulate all new pharmaceutical products  including our existing products and those under development 
our pharmaceutical company partners may experience significant delays in expected product releases while attempting to obtain regulatory approval for the products we develop 
if they are not successful  our revenues and profitability may decline 
we  and our pharmaceutical company partners  cannot control the timing of regulatory approval for the products we develop 
applicants for fda approval often must submit extensive clinical data and supporting information to the fda 
varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre clinical and clinical testing could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval of a drug product 
changes in fda approval policy during the development period  or changes in regulatory review for each submitted new drug application  also may cause delays or rejection of an approval 
in addition  prior to obtaining fda approval for a product  the manufacturing facility for the product must be pre approved by the fda 
failure by us to obtain fda pre approval of our manufacturing facilities could significantly delay or cause the rejection of fda approval for products we and our pharmaceutical company partners intend to manufacture and sell 
even if the fda approves a product  the approval may limit the uses or indications for which a product may be marketed  or may require further studies 
the fda also can withdraw product clearances and approvals for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or if unforeseen problems follow initial marketing 
manufacturers of drugs also must comply with applicable good manufacturing practices requirements 
if we cannot comply with applicable good manufacturing practices  we may be required to suspend the production and 
table of contents sale of our products  which would reduce our revenues and gross profits 
we may not be able to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices and other fda regulatory requirements for manufacturing as we expand our manufacturing operations 
we cannot guarantee that any future inspections will proceed without any compliance issues requiring time and resources to resolve 
we may be exposed to liability claims associated with the use of hazardous materials and chemicals 
our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals 
although we believe that our safety procedures for using  storing  handling and disposing of these materials comply with federal  state and local laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  and any liability could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require us to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products may contain controlled substance and or potent substances  the supply and manufacture of which may be limited or regulated by us government agencies 
the active ingredients in some of our current and proposed products  including oravescent fentanyl  are controlled substances under the controlled substances act of and are regulated by the us drug enforcement agency 
these products are subject to dea regulations relating to manufacturing  storage  distribution and physician prescription procedure 
products containing controlled substances may generate public controversy 
opponents of these products may seek restrictions on marketing and withdrawal of any regulatory approvals 
in addition  these opponents may seek to generate negative publicity in an effort to persuade the medical community to reject these products 
political pressures and adverse publicity could lead to delays in  and increased expenses for  and limit or restrict the introduction and marketing of products containing controlled substances 
furthermore  the dea could impose significant penalties and fines against us and our pharmaceutical company partners for violating the controlled substances act and dea regulations 
regulations under the occupational safety and health act establish certain standards related to safety in handling and manufacturing potent substances  such as fentanyl citrate 
under these regulations  we believe that our production of fentanyl citrate would require a specialized manufacturing environment that prevents fentanyl citrate from coming in contact with humans 
we may develop other products that would require a specialized manufacturing environment 
currently  none of our existing production lines in eden prairie nor our planned production line in brooklyn park are capable of manufacturing potent substances 
in the event we pursue the development of our oravescent fentanyl product through regulatory submission or other potential products with a comparable safety profile to fentanyl  we will be required to identify a manufacturer with appropriate resources to manufacture potent substances or to develop those capabilities internally 
we are presently assessing the feasibility of contracting with third party manufacturers that have these specialized manufacturing capabilities and of developing these capabilities internally 
in the event we decide to manufacture oravescent fentanyl or other potent products in our facilities  we will be required to add potent substance manufacturing capabilities that comply with these safety regulations  which could require capital expenditures in the excess of million 
if we choose not to invest in potent substance manufacturing capabilities  our future revenues may not grow as fast because we will be unable to compete in certain important therapeutic markets for our technologies 
our commercial products are subject to continuing regulations and we may be subject to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with applicable regulations 
even if our products receive regulatory approval  either in the us or internationally  we will continue to be subject to extensive regulatory requirements 
these regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things adverse drug experience reporting regulations  product promotion  product manufacturing  including good manufacturing practices requirements  and product changes or modifications 
if we fail to comply or maintain compliance with these laws and regulations  we may be fined or barred from selling our products 
if the fda determines that we are not complying with the law  it can 
table of contents issue warning letters  impose fines  seize products or order recalls  issue injunctions to stop future sales of products  refuse to permit products to be imported into  or exported out of  the us  totally or partially suspend our production  delay pending marketing applications  and initiate criminal prosecutions 
we have a single manufacturing facility for product requiring blister packaging and we may lose revenues and be unable to maintain our relationships with our pharmaceutical company partners if we lose production capacity for blistered product 
we manufacture all our products on two production lines in our eden prairie facility 
all of our commercialized products  except for schwarz pharma s nulev  are blister packaged on one or both of our eden prairie production lines 
if our existing production lines or facility becomes incapable of manufacturing products for any reason  we may be unable to meet production requirements  we may lose revenues and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with our pharmaceutical company partners 
without our existing production lines  we would have no other means of manufacturing products incorporating our drug delivery technologies until we were able to restore the manufacturing capability at our facility or to develop an alternative manufacturing facility 
although we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost revenues and profits in an amount we consider adequate  this insurance does not cover all possible situations 
in addition  our business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact on relations with our existing pharmaceutical company partners resulting from our inability to produce products for them 
the production line we expect to add at our brooklyn park facility will be dedicated to bottled product  which is important for products currently under development  but does not reduce the risk associated with loss of capacity for product requiring blister packaging 
we rely on single sources for some of our raw materials  and we may lose revenues and be unable to maintain our relationships with our pharmaceutical company partners if those materials were not available 
we rely on single suppliers for some of our raw materials and packaging supplies 
if these raw materials or packaging supplies were no longer available we may be unable to meet production requirements  we may lose revenues and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with our pharmaceutical company partners 
without adequate supplies of raw materials or packaging supplies  our manufacturing operations may be interrupted until another supplier could be identified  its products validated and trading terms with it negotiated 
we may not be able to identify an alternative supplier in a timely manner  or at all 
furthermore  we may not be able to negotiate favorable terms with an alternative supplier 
any disruptions in our manufacturing operations from the loss of a supplier could potentially damage our relations with our pharmaceutical company partners 
if we cannot develop additional products  our ability to increase our revenues would be limited 
we intend to continue to enhance our current technologies and pursue additional proprietary drug delivery technologies 
if we are unable to do so  we may be unable to achieve our objectives of revenue growth and sustained profitability 
even if enhanced or additional technologies appear promising during various stages of development  we may not be able to develop commercial applications for them because the potential technologies may fail clinical studies  we may not find a pharmaceutical company willing to adopt the technologies  it may be difficult to apply the technologies on a commercial scale  or the technologies may be uneconomical to market 
if we cannot keep pace with the rapid technological change and meet the intense competition in our industry  we may lose business 
our success depends  in part  on maintaining a competitive position in the development of products and technologies in a rapidly evolving field 
if we cannot maintain competitive products and technologies  our current and potential pharmaceutical company partners may choose to adopt the drug delivery technologies of our competitors 
fast dissolve tablet technologies that compete with our orasolv and durasolv technologies include the zydis technology developed by rp scherer corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of cardinal health  inc  the wowtab technology developed by yamanouchi pharma technologies  the flashtab technology developed by 
table of contents ethypharm  the flashdose technology developed by fuisz technologies ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of biovail corporation  and the oraquick technology developed by kv pharmaceutical company 
spi pharma  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of associated british foods plc  recently announced pharmaburst  a specially engineered excipient system that is capable of rapid disintegration 
in addition  eurand  a private specialty pharmaceutical company  recently announced that it has licensed a marketed  fast dissolve drug delivery technology  which is expected to be fully integrated into eurand s business in the second half of we also compete generally with other drug delivery  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies engaged in the development of alternative drug delivery technologies or new drug research and testing 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing  managerial and research and development resources and experience than we do and represent significant competition for us 
our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies or obtaining governmental approval for products before us 
the products of our competitors may gain market acceptance more rapidly than our products 
developments by competitors may render our products  or potential products  noncompetitive or obsolete 
if we cannot adequately protect our technology and proprietary information  we may be unable to sustain a competitive advantage 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to obtain and enforce patents for our products  processes and technologies and to preserve our trade secrets and other proprietary information 
if we cannot do so  our competitors may exploit our innovations and deprive us of the ability to realize revenues and profits from our developments 
we have been granted seventeen patents on our drug delivery and packaging systems in the us  which will expire beginning in any patent applications we may have made or may make relating to our potential products  processes and technologies may not result in patents being issued 
our current patents may not be valid or enforceable 
they may not protect us against competitors that challenge our patents  obtain patents that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business or are able to circumvent our patents 
further  we may not have the necessary financial resources to enforce our patents 
to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technologies and processes  we rely  in part  on confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and advisors 
these agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure  or if others lawfully develop the information 
third parties may claim that our technologies  or the products in which they are used  infringe on their rights  and we may incur significant costs resolving these claims 
third parties may claim that the manufacture  use or sale of our drug delivery technologies infringe on their patent rights 
if such claims are asserted  we may have to seek licenses  defend infringement actions or challenge the validity of those patents in court 
if we cannot obtain required licenses  are found liable for infringement or are not able to have these patents declared invalid  we may be liable for significant monetary damages  encounter significant delays in bringing products to market or be precluded from participating in the manufacture  use or sale of products or methods of drug delivery covered by the patents of others 
we may not have identified  or be able to identify in the future  us and foreign patents that pose a risk of potential infringement claims 
we enter into collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical companies to apply our drug delivery technologies to drugs developed by others 
ultimately  we receive license revenues and product development fees  as well as revenues from  and royalties on  the sale of products incorporating our technology 
the drugs to which our drug delivery technologies are applied are generally the property of the pharmaceutical companies 
those drugs may be the subject of patents or patent applications and other forms of protection owned by the pharmaceutical companies or third parties 
if those patents or other forms of protection expire  are challenged or become ineffective  sales of the drugs by the collaborating pharmaceutical company may be restricted or may cease 
because we have a limited operating history  potential investors in our stock may have difficulty evaluating our prospects 
we recorded the first commercial sales of products using our fast dissolve technologies in early accordingly  we have only a limited operating history  which may make it difficult for you and other potential 
table of contents investors to evaluate our prospects 
the difficulty investors may have in evaluating our prospects may cause volatile fluctuations  including decreases  in the market price of our common stock as investors react to information about our prospects 
since  we have generated revenues from product development fees and licensing arrangements  sales of products using our fast dissolve technologies and royalties 
we are currently making the transition from research and product development operations with limited production to commercial operations with expanding production capabilities in addition to research and product development activities 
our business and prospects  therefore  must be evaluated in light of the risks and uncertainties of a company with a limited operating history and  in particular  one in the pharmaceutical industry 
if we are not profitable in the future  the value of our stock may fall 
although we were profitable for the year ended december   we have accumulated aggregate net losses from inception of approximately million 
if we are unable to sustain profitable operations in future periods  the market price of our stock may fall 
the costs for research and product development of our drug delivery technologies and general and administrative expenses have been the principal causes of our losses 
our ability to achieve sustained profitable operations depends on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our direct control 
these factors include the demand for our products  our ability to manufacture our products efficiently and with the required quality  our ability to increase our manufacturing capacity  the level of product and price competition  our ability to develop additional commercial applications for our products  our ability to control our costs  and general economic conditions 
we may require additional financing  which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and which may result in dilution of the equity interest of an investor 
we may require additional financing to fund the development and possible acquisition of new drug delivery technologies and to increase our production capacity beyond what is currently anticipated 
if we cannot obtain financing when needed  or obtain it on favorable terms  we may be required to curtail any plans to develop or acquire new drug delivery technologies or may be required to limit the expansion of our manufacturing capacity 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents and expected revenues from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may elect to pursue additional financing at any time to more aggressively pursue development of new drug delivery technologies and expand manufacturing capacity beyond that currently planned 
other factors that will affect future capital requirements and may require us to seek additional financing include the level of expenditures necessary to develop or acquire new products or technologies  the progress of our research and product development programs  the need to construct a larger than currently anticipated manufacturing facility  or additional manufacturing facilities  to meet demand for our products  the results of our collaborative efforts with current and potential pharmaceutical company partners  and the timing of  and amounts received from  future product sales  product development fees and licensing revenue and royalties 
demand for some of our products is seasonal  and our sales and profits may suffer during periods when demand is light 
certain non prescription products that we manufacture for our pharmaceutical company partners treat seasonal ailments such as coughs and colds 
our pharmaceutical company partners may choose to not market those products in off seasons and our sales and profits may decline in those periods as a result 
for  operating revenues from novartis  which included revenues related to triaminic  a seasonal cough and cold product  represented nearly of our total operating revenues 
we may not be successful in developing a mix of products to reduce these seasonal variations

if any such claims against us are successful  we may be required to make significant compensation payments 
any indemnification that we have obtained  or may obtain  from contract research organizations or pharmaceutical companies conducting human clinical trials on our behalf may not protect us from product liability claims or from the costs of related litigation 
similarly  any indemnification we have obtained  or may obtain  from pharmaceutical companies with which we are developing our drug delivery technologies may not protect us from product liability claims from the consumers of those products or from the costs of related litigation 
if we are subject to a product liability claim  our product liability insurance may not reimburse us  or be sufficient to reimburse us  for any expenses or losses we may suffer 
a successful product liability claim against us  if not covered by  or if in excess of  our product liability insurance  may require us to make significant compensation payments  which would be reflected as expenses on our statement of operations and reduce our earnings
