item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ substantially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview since our inception  we have been engaged in developing drugs for the treatment of a variety of human diseases 
our lead program is the development of plenaxis abarelix for injectable suspension  a drug for the treatment of diseases that respond to the lowering of certain hormone levels 
we are developing plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer and endometriosis 
we are also conducting clinical trials of apan  our proprietary drug candidate for the treatment of alzheimer s disease 
in addition  we have a number of other product candidates in the research or preclinical development stage 
we had entered into collaborations with amgen and sanofi synth labo to develop and commercialize our plenaxis products 
in september  amgen notified us that it was terminating its agreement with us 
in october  sanofi synth labo notified us that it was terminating its agreement with us 
both terminations were effective in december as a result  all of the licenses for plenaxis granted to amgen and sanofi synth labo under these agreements  and all rights of amgen and sanofi synth labo in the plenaxis program  have terminated 
in  we entered into an agreement relating to the termination of these collaborations with each of amgen and sanofi synth labo 
since our inception  we have had no revenues from product sales 
prior to  a significant portion of our revenues was received under collaboration agreements through which we converted the potential value underlying our plenaxis program into a stream of upfront  milestone and expense reimbursement payments from corporate collaborators 
in  we regained full ownership of our plenaxis program from our corporate collaborators and  as a result  our revenues decreased substantially 
we do not anticipate receiving any additional revenues under former collaboration agreements 
substantially all of our expenditures to date have been for drug development and commercialization activities and for general and administrative expenses 
our accumulated deficit as of december  was approximately million 
at december   we had full time employees  of whom were engaged in research and development activities  compared to full time employees at december   of whom were engaged in research and development activities 
due to the costs associated with the continued development and potential commercialization of plenaxis for the treatment of a defined sub population of advanced prostate cancer patients  as well as other research and development and general and administrative expenses  and our lack of revenues  we had a net operating loss for the year ended december  we expect to have net operating losses for the next several years 
we do not expect to generate operating income unless we receive fda approval to market plenaxis in the united states for the treatment of a defined sub population of advanced prostate cancer patients 
assuming that we receive fda approval by the end of  and that we are able to partner clinical programs at opportune times  we believe that we will begin to generate operating income by the termination of our collaboration agreement with sanofi synth labo became effective as of december  and we received a final reimbursement payment of approximately million during the second quarter of including this payment  we recognized a total of approximately million in non refundable fees and performance based payments  and a total of approximately million in reimbursement for ongoing development costs under this agreement 
the termination of our collaboration agreement with amgen became effective as of december  under the amgen agreement  amgen paid the first million of all authorized costs and expenses associated with the research  development and commercialization of plenaxis products in the united states 
amgen s initial million funding commitment was fulfilled during the third quarter of following amgen s completion of this funding  we became responsible for one half of all subsequent united states research and development costs for plenaxis products 
additionally  the agreement provided that following amgen s completion of its million funding commitment  we were required to reimburse amgen for one half of the costs associated with establishing a sales and marketing infrastructure for plenaxis products in the united states 
through december   we recognized an aggregate of approximately million of revenues under the amgen agreement 
during  we recognized no additional revenues under this agreement 
on august   we executed a termination agreement with amgen 
in accordance with this agreement  we made a final payment to amgen of million 
this payment represented full and complete satisfaction of our share of the expenses incurred under the collaboration agreement  as well as consideration for the receipt from amgen of full title to  and possession of  all materials inventory purchased during the term of the collaboration 
prior to signing the termination agreement with amgen  we had provided a million accrual representing previously incurred collaboration expenses  our share of purchased materials inventory  and certain other costs associated with finalizing the termination 
as a result of our payment of million plus certain related legal fees in connection with the termination agreement  we eliminated our accrued liability related to the amgen agreement and recognized a gain on termination of million 
critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the commission indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical use of estimates 
we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require that we make estimates and use assumptions that affect the reporting of our assets and our liabilities as well as the disclosures that we make regarding assets and liabilities and income and expense that are contingent upon uncertain factors as of the reporting date 
the actual payments  and thus our actual results  could differ from our estimates 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas no 
 requires that if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from a company s asset  net of interest charges  is less than the reported value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
we evaluate our property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the amount of the impairment to be recognized is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the reported value of the asset 
we believe that the application of sfas no 
and the method used to determine the impairment of our property  plant and equipment involve critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period and because they require management to make assumptions about future cash flows  including residual values 
in addition  we believe that had alternative assumptions been used the impact of recognizing an impairment on the assets reported on our balance sheet  as well as our net loss  may have been material 
we reviewed our building for impairment as of december  we have determined that the undiscounted sum of the expected future cash flows from the building exceeded the recorded value of the building 
as a result  no impairment allowance was required in accordance with sfas no 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  from approximately million in the decrease in revenues was the result of the termination during the fourth quarter of of our collaboration agreements with amgen and sanofi synth labo 
during our revenues were comprised principally of reimbursement revenues under these agreements 
during our revenues were comprised of a final reimbursement payment received in connection with the termination of our agreement with sanofi synth labo 
we will not receive any additional revenues under these agreements 
furthermore  if the fda does not grant marketing approval for plenaxis in the united states  or if approval is substantially delayed  such denial or delay is likely to have a materially adverse impact on our future planned revenues 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  from approximately million in the slight decrease in expenses primarily reflects slightly reduced spending in our plenaxis prostate cancer clinical program and  to a lesser extent  the lack of spending on our clinical program for latranal  an in licensed compound that was in development for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain 
development of latranal was discontinued during the third quarter of these decreases were partially offset by increased spending on preclinical studies related to our experimental drug candidate ppi we are unable to predict the precise level of spending on individual clinical programs due to the uncertain nature of clinical development 
however  as a result of the resubmission of our nda during february  we plan to reduce our spending on the clinical development of plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer during and thereafter 
we also expect spending on our endometriosis program to decline during pending decisions regarding further development 
we plan to increase our development efforts on apan and future clinical programs during and thereafter and  accordingly  will increase our spending in these areas 
overall  we expect our research and development expenses to decrease during and then increase thereafter 
in addition  we currently have several other ongoing research and development programs 
using industry estimates  typical drug development programs may last for ten or more years and may cost hundreds of millions of dollars to complete 
as our programs progress  we will assess the possibility of entering into corporate collaborations to offset a portion of development costs 
the ultimate success of our research and development programs and the impact of these programs on our operations and financial results cannot be accurately predicted and will depend  in large part  upon the outcome and timing of many variables outside of our control 
members of our research and development team typically work on a number of projects concurrently 
in addition  a substantial amount of our fixed costs such as facility depreciation  utilities and maintenance are shared by our various programs 
accordingly  we have not and do not plan to specifically identify all costs related to each of our research and development programs 
we estimate that during and  the majority of our research and development expenses were related to manufacturing costs  clinical trial costs  salaries and lab supplies related to our prostate cancer and endometriosis clinical programs 
the remaining research and development costs were incurred primarily in our alzheimer s disease clinical program  our ppi preclinical research program and our other research programs 
we began our clinical program to develop plenaxis for the treatment of prostate cancer during in december  we submitted an nda to the fda for plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive prostate cancer 
however  the fda raised concerns over the occurrence of immediate onset  systemic allergic reactions in a small subset of clinical trial patients 
in addition  the fda expressed concern that  in a subset of patients treated beyond the three month pivotal study time frame  fluctuations in testosterone levels were observed more frequently in patients treated with plenaxis than in patients treated with either lupron depot or lupron depot plus casodex 
we have proposed various alternatives to the fda to address these issues and improve the risk benefit profile of plenaxis 
based upon our discussions with the fda  we now are seeking approval for plenaxis for use in a defined sub population of advanced prostate cancer patients for whom the use of existing hormonal therapies may not be appropriate 
the specific sub population of patients will be determined through additional discussions with the fda 
we resubmitted our nda on february  seeking approval for this indication and expect a response from the fda within six months of that date 
we also intend to file  during the second quarter of  a registration dossier in europe seeking approval to market plenaxis for the treatment of a broad population of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer patients 
however  we cannot assure investors that we will be successful in obtaining approval in the united states or abroad for the commercialization of plenaxis for the treatment of any portion of the hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer patient population or for any other indication 
in  we began our clinical program to develop plenaxis for the treatment of endometriosis 
we completed a phase ii study of plenaxis for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis in march results from this study have suggested that we may be able to utilize a lower dose and or a more prolonged dosing interval in future studies to reduce drug exposure and attendant bone mineral density loss  a known consequence of hormonal therapies that lower estrogen levels 
accordingly  during  we initiated and completed both the dosing and observation phases of a pharmacokinetic study of plenaxis for the treatment of endometriosis to examine the appropriate dose and dosing schedule 
upon completion of our review of the results of this study  we will determine the next steps for development 
we began our clinical program for apan in we are currently conducting a normal volunteer  phase ia dose escalation study of apan to identify the mtd in healthy volunteers 
assuming favorable fda review of the study s results  we intend to move into a phase ib trial in alzheimer s disease patients during the first half of this ib study will test a single administration of apan to establish the mtd in patients 
upon completion of the phase ib study and  assuming favorable fda review of the study s results  we expect to initiate a phase ic trial examining multiple administrations of a selected apan dose in alzheimer s disease patients 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  from approximately million in during  we incurred increased sales and marketing expenses in preparation for the potential launch of plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer 
the subsequent decrease in sales and marketing expenses was due to the temporary suspension of the majority of marketing efforts resulting from the repositioning of our prostate cancer program in response to issues raised by the fda 
these expenses are likely to increase during and thereafter as we again incur costs related to preparing for the possible launch of plenaxis for the treatment of a defined sub population of advanced prostate cancer patients 
we intend  upon fda approval of our application  to market and sell plenaxis in the united states through our own marketing and sales team 
accordingly  assuming fda approval of plenaxis  we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase during and thereafter  and to include expenses relating to the building of a marketing infrastructure  the cost of our sales force  commissions to the sales force on plenaxis sales and promotional and marketing programs 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  from approximately million in this increase was due primarily to higher facility related expenses 
in may  we occupied our new  larger facility and began incurring depreciation expense and increased utilities  maintenance and tax expenses 
in addition  higher personnel related operating costs and increased professional services expenses contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for and going forward now fully reflect these new facility related expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase slightly during and thereafter based on normal hiring of additional administrative personnel to support continued growth of our research  development and commercialization initiatives 
net interest income for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  from approximately million in the decrease in net interest income was due primarily to lower average cash balances and reduced average interest rates 
the provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and was zero 
we anticipate that we will continue to be in a net operating loss carryforward position for the next several years 
therefore  as in  no benefit from our operating losses has been recognized 
we account for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  valuation allowances  in amounts equal to the net deferred tax assets as of december  and  have been established in each period to reflect these uncertainties 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million that will expire in varying amounts through  if not utilized 
utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be subject to substantial annual limitations under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the annual limitations may result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization 
years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  from approximately million in the decrease in revenues was the result of decreases in both the amount and rate of reimbursement of plenaxis expenses from our former collaborators  as well as the one time sale of materials inventory to amgen during the fourth quarter of research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  from approximately million in this decrease in expenses was due primarily to the one time sale of materials inventory to amgen during the fourth quarter of combined with reduced clinical spending during the second half of as we repositioned the plenaxis program in response to issues raised by the fda 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  from approximately million in the increase in expenses was primarily the result of our obligation under our agreement with amgen  beginning in the third quarter of  to pay one half of all subsequent costs associated with establishing a sales and marketing infrastructure in the united states for plenaxis through the launch period 
these increases were partially offset by decreased spending on marketing and sales for the plenaxis program during the second half of general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  from approximately million in the increase was due to an increase in personnel related operating costs and increased use of professional services 
net interest income for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  from approximately million in the increase in interest income was due to increased cash and investment balances from our follow on public offering in february  offset by lower interest rates 
the increase in interest expense was due to a higher average principal balance outstanding for a full year during under the loan agreement entered into in connection with the purchase in july of our corporate headquarters and primary research facility 
the provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and was zero and million  respectively 
the provision for income taxes during was primarily for state income taxes 
we were in a net operating loss carryforward position during and therefore no benefit from our operating losses was recognized 
selected quarterly operating results the following table sets forth our unaudited statement of operations data for the eight quarters ended december  this information has been derived from our unaudited financial statements 
the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing in this report and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring accruals  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our annual audited financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
you should not draw any conclusions from the operating results for any quarter

 in thousands  except per share data total revenues      operating loss      net loss      basic and diluted net loss per share in august  we executed a termination agreement with amgen and recognized a gain on termination of million 
we expect to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results in the future  and  therefore  we will continue to have difficulty providing an accurate forecast of our quarterly revenues and operating results 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as any indication of future performance 
it is likely that our operating results in one or more future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline 
liquidity and capital resources to date  our operations and capital requirements have been financed primarily with the proceeds of public and private sales of common stock and preferred stock  research and development partnerships  collaborative agreements and investment income 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million and working capital of approximately million  compared to approximately million and million  respectively  at december  during  we expect to use approximately million of our current cash and investments in our business 
we believe that our existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs through approximately the end of assuming receipt by the end of of regulatory approval to market plenaxis in the united states for a defined sub population of advanced prostate cancer patients  partnering of clinical programs at opportune times and continued conservative fiscal management  we believe that we should have sufficient financial resources to execute our operating plan and attain profitability by without returning to the capital markets 
for the year ended december   net cash of approximately million was used in operating activities  compared to approximately million used in operating activities during during the year ended december   our use of cash in operations was due principally to our net loss of approximately million  and our payment of million in connection with the amgen termination agreement  partially offset by depreciation and amortization 
we expect our cash utilization to increase during as a result of an overall increase in operating expenses as we prepare for the possible commercial launch of plenaxis in the united states for the treatment of a defined sub population of advanced prostate cancer patients  continue with clinical trials for apan  initiate a new clinical program for ppi and expand our research and development initiatives 
the actual amount of these expenditures will depend on numerous factors  including the timing of expenses and the timing and progress of our research  development  marketing and sales efforts 
net cash used in investing activities of approximately million in consisted of purchases of property and equipment of approximately million  and net purchases of marketable securities of approximately million 
this represents a decline in net cash used in investing activities of approximately million from net cash used in investing activities in consisted of the conversion of cash equivalents held at the end of the prior year and the proceeds from our follow on public offering into instruments with slightly longer maturities  as well as purchases of property and equipment of approximately million 
our financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of approximately million of proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options 
this contrasts with the approximately million in net cash provided by financing activities in  primarily attributable to our follow on public offering 
in july  in connection with the purchase  through our wholly owned real estate subsidiary  of our corporate headquarters and research facility in waltham  massachusetts  the subsidiary entered into an acquisition and construction loan agreement providing for up to million in financing for the acquisition of  and improvements to  the facility 
as of december   million was outstanding under the loan agreement 
advances bear interest at a rate equal to the day libor plus at december  
interest is payable monthly in arrears 
principal is due and payable in full on july   subject to two one year extension options 
we intend to exercise the option to extend the maturity date until july  and believe that we will be able to satisfy the conditions for this extension set forth in the loan agreement 
the loan is secured by the facility  together with all fixtures  equipment  improvements and other related items  and by all rents  income or profits received by our real estate subsidiary  and is unconditionally guaranteed by us 
in addition to this financing  we have spent approximately million of our own funds in connection with the build out and occupancy of this facility 
we have occupied this facility since may and  as planned  are actively seeking to sublease a portion of the facility 
in addition to our long term debt  we have fixed purchase obligations under various supply agreements 
as of december   our long term debt and fixed purchase obligations were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt obligations   unconditional purchase obligations   total    at december   we had provided a valuation allowance of million for our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance represents the value of the deferred tax assets 
due to anticipated operating losses in the future  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the net deferred tax assets in the future and we have provided an appropriate valuation allowance 
recent accounting pronouncements on october   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
sfas no 
supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  however it retains the fundamental provision of that statement related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used 
in addition  sfas no 
provides additional guidance on estimating cash flows when performing a recoverability test  requiring that a long lived asset to be disposed of other than by sale be classified as an asset held for sale until it is disposed of  and establishes more restrictive criteria to classify an asset as held for sale 
sfas no 
became effective in the first quarter of the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any effect on the company s consolidated results of operations in in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas no 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf issue no 
relates to sfas no 
s requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in eitf issue no 
was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
therefore  sfas no 
eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in eitf issue no 
sfas no 
also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the company does not anticipate the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
on december   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  or sfas no 
sfas no 
amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
 to provide alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and accounting principles board opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  or apb no 
 to include increased pro forma disclosure of the effects of stock based employee compensation on the results of operations 
sfas no 
became effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company has elected to continue to account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method as described in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations in risk factors that may affect future results because we have not yet marketed or sold any products and anticipate significant increases in our operating expenses over the next several years  we may not be profitable in the future 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future or  if we attain profitability  that it will be sustainable 
all of our potential products are in the research or development stage 
we have not yet marketed or sold any products  and we may not succeed in developing and marketing any product in the future 
to date  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from payments under corporate collaboration and license agreements 
due to the termination of the amgen and sanofi synth labo agreements and the uncertainty regarding regulatory approval for our lead product candidate  plenaxis  for the foreseeable future  we do not expect to have any revenues  other than interest income 
in addition  we expect to continue to spend significant amounts to develop commercial sales and marketing capabilities  continue clinical studies  seek regulatory approval for our existing product candidates and for further build out of our facility 
we also intend to spend substantial amounts to fund additional research and development for other potential products  enhance our core technologies  and for general and administrative purposes 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly in the near term due primarily to increased expenses related to the continued development and pre commercialization activities for plenaxis  resulting in significant operating losses at least through and possibly thereafter 
if our clinical trials are not successful  or if we are otherwise unable to obtain and maintain the regulatory approval required to market and sell our potential products  we would incur additional operating losses 
the development and sale of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities 
obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval typically is costly and takes many years 
regulatory authorities  most importantly  the fda  have substantial discretion to terminate clinical trials  delay or withhold registration and marketing approval in the united states  and mandate product recalls 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production or injunction  as well as other actions as to our potential products or against us 
outside the united states  we can market a product only if we receive marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
this foreign regulatory approval process includes all of risks associated with the fda approval process  and may include additional risks 
to gain regulatory approval from the fda and foreign regulatory authorities for the commercial sale of any product  we must demonstrate in clinical trials  and satisfy the fda and foreign regulatory authorities as to  the safety and efficacy of the product 
if we develop a product to treat a long lasting disease  such as cancer or alzheimer s disease  we must gather data over an extended period of time 
there are many risks associated with our clinical trials 
for example  we may be unable to achieve the same level of success in later trials as we did in earlier ones 
additionally  data we obtain from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could impede regulatory approval 
further  some patients in our prostate cancer and alzheimer s disease programs have a high risk of death  age related disease or other adverse medical events that may not be related to our products 
these events may affect the statistical analysis of the safety and efficacy of our products 
if we obtain regulatory approval for a product  the approval will be limited to those diseases for which our clinical trials demonstrate the product is safe and effective 
in addition  many factors could delay or result in termination of our ongoing or future clinical trials 
for example  a clinical trial may experience slow patient enrollment or lack of sufficient drug supplies 
patients may experience adverse medical events or side effects  and there may be a real or perceived lack of effectiveness of  or of safety issues associated with  the drug we are testing 
future governmental action or existing or changes in fda policies or precedents  may also result in delays or rejection of an application for marketing approval 
the fda has considerable discretion in determining whether to grant marketing approval for a drug  and may delay or deny approval even in circumstances where the applicant s clinical trials have proceeded in compliance with fda procedures and regulations and have met the established end points of the trials 
challenges to fda determinations are generally time consuming and costly 
we can give no assurance that we will obtain marketing approval for plenaxis  our drug candidate for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer and endometriosis  or for any of our other product candidates  or regulatory approval may be conditioned upon significant labeling requirements which could adversely affect the marketability or value of the product 
to date  none of our product candidates has received regulatory approval for commercial sale 
in june  we received a letter from the fda with respect to our nda for plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer  in which the fda indicated that the information presented in the nda was inadequate for approval 
the fda raised concerns over the occurrence of immediate onset  systemic allergic reactions in a small subset of clinical trial patients 
in addition  the fda expressed concern that  in a subset of patients treated beyond the three month pivotal study time frame  fluctuations in testosterone levels were observed more frequently in patients treated with plenaxis than in patients treated with either lupron depot or lupron depot plus casodex 
we have proposed various alternatives to the fda to address these issues and improve the risk benefit profile of plenaxis 
based upon our discussions with the fda  we are now seeking approval for plenaxis for use in a defined sub population of advanced prostate cancer patients for whom the use of existing hormonal therapies may not be appropriate 
the specific sub population of patients will be determined through additional discussions with the fda 
in february  we resubmitted to the fda our nda seeking approval for this indication 
we expect to receive a response from the fda within six months 
the fda actions described above have delayed  and otherwise adversely affected  our obtaining regulatory approval to market plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer 
moreover  there could be further delays due to fda review or action  and the fda could deny approval altogether 
if we are further delayed in obtaining or are unable to obtain this regulatory approval  or regulatory approval to market our other potential products  we may exhaust our available resources significantly sooner than we had planned  particularly given the termination of the amgen and sanofi synth labo agreements 
if this were to happen  we would need to either raise additional funds or seek alternative partners to complete development and commercialization of plenaxis and continue our currently planned research and development programs 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to raise the necessary funds or negotiate additional corporate collaborations on acceptable terms  if at all 
the termination by our corporate collaborators of their agreements with us could adversely affect the development and commercialization of plenaxis 
we depended upon our former corporate collaborators  amgen and sanofi synth labo  to provide substantial financial support for the development and commercialization of plenaxis 
we also relied on them to some extent in seeking regulatory approval in the united states and abroad for plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer 
in addition  under our agreement with amgen  they had assumed principal responsibility for the manufacture of plenaxis  and under our agreements with amgen and sanofi synth labo  those parties were responsible for the marketing  distribution and sale of plenaxis in their respective licensed territories 
accordingly  we have had  and will continue for the foreseeable future  to devote funds and other resources to plenaxis development and commercialization that we had planned would be available from our collaborators 
in addition  we have had  and in the future may have  to enter into new arrangements with third parties to support the plenaxis program 
if we encounter unanticipated expenses or delays in the development and commercialization of plenaxis for a defined sub population of advanced prostate cancer patients  we may be required to curtail or terminate one or more of our other drug development programs and or seek additional funding 
we cannot assure investors that we would be able to raise such additional funds 
we may be unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities necessary to successfully commercialize plenaxis or our other our potential products 
we have no experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and have very limited marketing and sales resources 
to achieve commercial success for any approved product  we must either develop a marketing and sales force  as well as the infrastructure to support it  or enter into arrangements with others to market and sell our products 
we may be unable to establish marketing  sales and distribution capabilities necessary to commercialize and gain market acceptance for our potential products 
we have announced our intention to independently market and sell plenaxis in the united states if we receive fda approval of this compound for use in a defined sub population of advanced prostate cancer patients 
accordingly  we will need to hire a sales force with expertise in pharmaceutical sales 
recruiting and retaining qualified sales personnel will be critical to our success 
competition for skilled personnel is intense  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals to successfully launch plenaxis or any other potential product 
in addition  establishing the expertise necessary to successfully market and sell plenaxis  or any other product  will require a substantial capital investment 
we cannot assure you that we will have the funds necessary to successfully commercialize plenaxis for the treatment of a defined sub population of advanced prostate cancer patients or any other potential product 
in the event that we decide to contract with third parties to provide sales force capabilities to meet our needs for plenaxis or any other product candidates  we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  co promotion or other marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize potential products could significantly limit the revenues we derive from these potential products  and these third parties may fail to commercialize our potential products successfully 
to the extent we enter into any such agreements  the parties to those agreements may also market products that compete with our products  further limiting our potential revenue from product sales 
even if we receive approval for the marketing and sale of plenaxis or any of our other product candidates  they may fail to achieve market acceptance and  accordingly  may never be commercially successful 
many factors may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of plenaxis or any of our other potential products  including the scope of the patient population and the indications for which plenaxis or our other product candidates are approved  the effectiveness of plenaxis or any of our other product candidates  including any potential side effects  as compared to alternative treatment methods  the extent and success of our marketing and sales efforts relating to the marketing and sales of plenaxis or other potential products  the product labeling or product insert required by the fda for plenaxis and each of our other product candidates  the rate at which plenaxis or our other product candidates are reimbursed by third party payors  in particular medicare  the timing of market entry as compared to competitive products  the rate of adoption of plenaxis or our other product candidates by doctors and nurses and acceptance by the target patient population  the competitive features of our products as compared to other products  including the frequency of administration of plenaxis as compared to other products  and doctor and patient acceptance of these features  the cost effectiveness of plenaxis or our other product candidates and the availability of insurance or other third party reimbursement  in particular medicare  for patients using our products  and unfavorable publicity concerning plenaxis or any of our other product candidates or any similar products 
if our products are not commercially successful  we may never become profitable 
if we fail to develop and maintain our relationships with third party manufacturers  or if these manufacturers fail to perform adequately  we may be unable to commercialize plenaxis or any of our product candidates 
our ability to conduct  or continue to conduct  clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates  including plenaxis  will depend in part on our ability to manufacture  or arrange for third party manufacture of  our products on a large scale  at a competitive cost and in accordance with regulatory requirements 
we must establish and maintain a commercial scale formulation and manufacturing process for each of our potential products for which we seek marketing approval 
we or third party manufacturers may encounter difficulties with these processes at any time that could result in delays in clinical trials  regulatory submissions or in the commercialization of potential products 
we have no experience in large scale product manufacturing  nor do we have the resources or facilities to manufacture products on a commercial scale 
we will continue to rely upon contract manufacturers to produce plenaxis and other compounds for later stage preclinical  clinical and commercial purposes for a significant period of time 
third party manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs as to timing  quantity or quality of materials 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of needed materials on acceptable terms  or if we encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with manufacturers  our clinical trials may be delayed  thereby preventing or delaying the submission of product candidates for  or the granting of  regulatory approval and the commercialization of our potential products 
any such delays may lower our revenues and delay or prevent our attaining or maintaining profitability 
if the third party manufacturers upon which we rely fail to meet our needs for clinical or commercial supply  we may be required to supplement our manufacturing capacity by building our own manufacturing facilities 
this would require substantial expenditures 
also  we would need to hire and train significant numbers of employees to staff a new facility 
if we are required to build our own facility  we may not be able to develop sufficient manufacturing capacity to produce drug materials for clinical trials or commercial use 
in addition  we and the third party manufacturers that we use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practice regulations enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
if our facilities or the facilities of third party manufacturers cannot pass a pre approval plant inspection  the fda pre market approval of our product candidates will not be granted 
in complying with these regulations and foreign regulatory requirements  we and any of our third party manufacturers will be obligated to expend time  money and effort in production  record keeping and quality control to assure that our potential products meet applicable specifications and other requirements 
if we or any of our third party manufacturers fail to comply with these requirements  we may be subject to regulatory sanctions 
any of these factors could prevent  or cause delays in  obtaining regulatory approvals for  and the manufacturing  marketing or selling of  our potential products  including plenaxis  and could also result in significantly higher operating expenses 
under our collaboration agreement with amgen  amgen had control over certain phases of the manufacturing process for plenaxis and was itself performing certain manufacturing processes 
due to the termination of our collaboration agreement with amgen  to assure an adequate supply of drug product for continued clinical studies and  if plenaxis is approved for marketing  for commercial sale  we were required to enter into a new agreement with a third party manufacturer to provide for the manufacturing functions that amgen had been performing 
due to the use of a different manufacturer  we may be required to undergo additional regulatory review and compliance procedures which could result in additional expenses and further delay the regulatory review and potential commercialization of plenaxis for the treatment of a defined sub population of advanced prostate cancer patients 
the loss or failure of any of our third party manufacturers could substantially delay or impair our development  or our sale or continued sale  of plenaxis products 
for each stage of plenaxis production we have relied  and expect in the near term to continue to rely  on a separate third party manufacturer  and we currently have not contracted  and in the near term do not expect to contract  with second source suppliers for any of these production stages 
accordingly  the loss of one or more of these suppliers for any reason  including as a result of fire  terrorism  acts of god or insolvency or bankruptcy  could result in substantial delays in  or substantially impair our ability to complete  clinical trials and regulatory submissions or reviews  and could delay or impair substantially our sale or continued sale of plenaxis products 
such delays or impairment  and the associated costs and expenses  may lower our potential revenues and delay or prevent our attaining profitability 
while we intend to evaluate the possibility of a second source of supply at each stage of plenaxis production  the number of qualified alternative suppliers is limited  and we cannot assure investors that we will be able to locate alternative suppliers or negotiate second supply agreements on reasonable terms 
furthermore  the process of engineering a new supplier s facility for the production of plenaxis and obtaining the necessary fda approval of the facility would require substantial lead time and could be extremely costly 
we cannot assure investors that we will not lose one or more of our suppliers  or that in such event we would be readily able to continue the development and commercialization and sale of plenaxis products without substantial and costly delays 
alternative treatments are available which may impair our ability to capture market share for our potential products 
alternative products exist or are under development to treat the diseases for which we are developing drugs 
for example  the fda has approved several drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer that responds to changes in hormone levels 
even if the fda approves plenaxis for commercialization for the treatment of a defined sub population of advanced prostate cancer patients  the approval is expected to be limited to a particular group of patients or to administration over a limited period of time  and plenaxis may not compete favorably with existing treatments that already have an established market share 
if plenaxis does not achieve broad market acceptance as a drug for the treatment of a defined sub population of advanced prostate cancer patients  we may not become profitable 
because we depend on third parties to conduct laboratory testing and human clinical studies and assist us with regulatory compliance  we may encounter delays in product development and commercialization 
we have contracts with a limited number of research organizations to design and conduct our laboratory testing and human clinical studies 
if we cannot contract for testing activities on acceptable terms  or at all  we may not complete our product development efforts in a timely manner 
to the extent we rely on third parties for laboratory testing and human clinical studies  we may lose some control over these activities 
for example  third parties may not complete testing activities on schedule or when we request them to do so 
in addition  these third parties may conduct our clinical trials in a manner inconsistent with regulatory requirements or otherwise in a manner that yields misleading or unreliable data 
this  or other failures of these third parties to carry out their duties  could result in significant additional costs and expenses and could delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
our potential revenues will diminish if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for plenaxis or our other product candidates from third party payors 
the continuing efforts of government and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care may limit our commercial opportunity 
if government and other third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for plenaxis or our other product candidates  physicians may not prescribe them 
if we are unable to offer physicians comparable or superior financial motivation to use plenaxis or our other product candidates  we may not be able to generate significant revenues 
in some foreign markets  pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls 
in addition  increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any products in the future 
further  cost control initiatives could impair or diminish our ability or incentive  or the ability or incentive of potential partners  to commercialize plenaxis or any of our other products  and our ability to earn revenues from this commercialization 
our ability to commercialize pharmaceutical products  alone or with collaborators  may depend in part on the availability of reimbursement for our products from government and health administration authorities  private health insurers  and other third party payors  including medicare and medicaid 
we cannot predict the availability of reimbursement for newly approved drugs 
third party payors  including medicare  are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
government and other third party payors increasingly are limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and  in some cases  refusing to provide coverage for a patient s use of an approved drug for purposes not approved by the fda 
third party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for plenaxis or any of our other products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to develop and commercialize products that make our potential products and technologies obsolete or non competitive 
a biotechnology company such as ours must keep pace with rapid technological change and faces intense competition 
we compete with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for funding  access to new technology  research personnel and in product research and development 
many of these companies have greater financial resources and more experience than we do in developing drugs  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and marketing 
we also face competition from academic and research institutions and government agencies pursuing alternatives to our products and technologies 
we expect that all of our products under development will face intense competition from existing or future drugs 
in addition  for each of our product candidates  we may face increasing competition from generic formulations or existing drugs whose active components are no longer covered by patents 
our competitors may successfully identify drug candidates or develop products earlier than we do  obtain approvals from the fda or foreign regulatory bodies more rapidly than we do  develop products that are more effective  have fewer side effects or cost less than our products  or successfully market products that compete with our products 
the success of our competitors in any of these efforts would adversely affect our ability to develop  commercialize and market our product candidates and to attain and maintain profitability 
if we are unable to obtain and enforce valid patents  we could lose any competitive advantage we may have 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our technologies and potential products 
if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode any competitive advantage we may have 
for example  if we lose our patent protection for plenaxis  another party could produce and market the compound in direct competition with us 
some foreign countries lack rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights and do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the united states 
many companies have had difficulty protecting their proprietary rights in foreign countries 
patent positions are sometimes uncertain and usually involve complex legal and factual questions 
we can protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we currently own or have exclusively licensed issued united states patents 
we have applied  and will continue to apply  for patents covering both our technologies and products as we deem appropriate 
others may challenge our patent applications or our patent applications may not result in issued patents 
moreover  any issued patents on our own inventions  or those licensed from third parties  may not provide us with adequate protection  or others may challenge the validity of  or seek to narrow or circumvent  these patents 
third party patents may impair or block our ability to conduct our business 
additionally  third parties may independently develop products similar to our products  duplicate our unpatented products  or design around any patented products we develop 
if we are unable to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information  we could lose any competitive advantage we may have 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  confidentiality  nondisclosure and other contractual provisions  and security measures to protect our confidential and proprietary information 
these measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
if these measures do not adequately protect our rights  third parties could use our technology  and we could lose any competitive advantage we may have 
in addition  others may independently develop similar proprietary information or techniques  which could impair any competitive advantage we may have 
if our technologies  processes or potential products conflict with the patents or other intellectual property rights of competitors  universities or others  we could have to engage in costly litigation and be unable to commercialize those products 
our technologies  processes or potential products may give rise to claims that they infringe patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
a third party could force us to pay damages  stop our use of these technologies or processes  or stop our manufacturing or marketing of the affected products by bringing a legal action against us for infringement 
in addition  we could be required to obtain a license to continue to use the technologies or processes or manufacture or market the affected products  and we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms or at all 
we believe that significant litigation will continue in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in litigation  it could consume a substantial portion of our resources 
even if legal actions were meritless  defending a lawsuit could take significant time  be expensive and divert management s attention from other business concerns 
if third parties terminate our licenses  we could experience delays or be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our potential products 
we license some of our technology from third parties 
termination of our licenses could force us to delay or discontinue some of our development and commercialization programs 
for example  if advanced research and technology institute  the assignee of indiana university foundation  terminated our license with them  we could have to discontinue development and commercialization of our plenaxis products 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to license substitute technology in the future 
our inability to do so could impair our ability to conduct our business because we may lack the technology  or the necessary rights to technology  required to develop and commercialize our potential products 
we may have substantial exposure to product liability claims and may not have adequate insurance to cover those claims 
we may be held liable if any product we develop  or any product made by others using our technologies  causes injury 
we have only limited product liability insurance coverage for our potential products in clinical trials 
we intend to expand our product liability insurance coverage for any of our products for which we obtain marketing approval 
however  this insurance may be prohibitively expensive or may not fully cover our potential liabilities 
our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products 
our collaboration agreements with amgen and sanofi synth labo included  and the agreements with them regarding the termination of those collaborations also include  an indemnification of them for liabilities associated with the development and commercialization of plenaxis 
if a third party  including a former collaborator  sues us for any injury  or for indemnification for losses  arising out of products made by us or using our technologies  our liability could exceed our total assets 
we may be unable to find suitable tenants for a portion of our facility 
in may  we moved to a new  square foot facility in waltham  massachusetts 
we are currently seeking to sublease a portion of this facility 
to date  we have not been able to find suitable sub tenants to occupy this space 
if we are unable to find suitable sub tenants  we will not be able to offset with rental income any of the substantial mortgage payments and other operating expenses associated with our facility 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional skilled personnel  we may be unable to pursue our product development and commercialization efforts 
we depend substantially on the principal members of our management and scientific staff  including malcolm l 
gefter  phd  our chief executive officer and chairman of the board  and william k 
heiden  our president and chief operating officer 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time and work for one of our competitors 
the loss of these key individuals could result in competitive harm because we could experience delays in our product research  development and commercialization efforts without their expertise 
recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform future research and development work also will be critical to our success 
competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high 
we compete with numerous companies and academic and other research institutions for experienced scientists 
this competition may limit our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms 
failure to attract and retain qualified personnel would prevent us from continuing to develop our potential products  enhancing our technologies and launching our products commercially 
our planned activities will require the addition of new personnel  including management and marketing and sales personnel  and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel  in particular in the area of product marketing and sales 
the inability to retain these personnel or to develop this expertise could prevent  or result in delays in  the research  development and commercialization of plenaxis or our other potential products 
we use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in our business and any claims relating to the handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials  which may pose health risks 
for example  the health risks associated with accidental exposure to plenaxis include temporary impotence or infertility and harmful effects on pregnant women 
our operations also produce hazardous waste products 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge from hazardous materials and any resultant injury 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials 
compliance with health and safety and environmental laws and regulations is necessary and expensive 
current or future health and safety and environmental regulations may impair our research  development or production efforts 
we may be required to pay fines  penalties or damages in the event of noncompliance or the exposure of individuals to hazardous materials 
from time to time  third parties have also worked with hazardous materials in connection with our agreements with them 
we have agreed to indemnify our present and former collaborators in some circumstances against damages and other liabilities arising out of development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations 
if we engage in an acquisition  we will incur a variety of costs and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
if appropriate opportunities become available  we may attempt to acquire businesses  or acquire or in license products or technologies  that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
we currently have no commitments or agreements for any acquisitions 
if we do undertake any transaction of this sort  the process of integrating an acquired business  or an acquired or in licensed product or technology  may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction of this sort 
to the extent we issue stock in a transaction  the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted 
transactions of this kind could also cause us to incur debt  expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
the market price of our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to announcement of fda approval or disapproval of plenaxis for the treatment of a defined sub population of advanced prostate cancer patients or any of our other product candidates  failure or delay by third party manufacturers in performing their supply obligations or disputes or litigation regarding those obligations  our ability to commercialize  directly or with collaborators  our product candidates and the timing of commercialization  the success rate of our discovery efforts and clinical trials  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights  including claims of infringement  interference or litigation against us or our licensors  announcements concerning our competitors  or the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry in general  public concerns as to the safety of our products or our competitors products  changes in government regulation of the pharmaceutical or medical industry  changes in the reimbursement policies of third party insurance companies or government agencies  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  sales of large blocks of our common stock  changes in accounting principles  and the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the securities of biotechnology companies  particularly companies like ours without current product revenues and earnings  have been highly volatile  and may continue to be highly volatile in the future 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities 
whether or not meritorious  litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
we expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate  and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the timing and level of expenses related to the development and commercialization of our plenaxis products leading to revenues from product sales  the timing and level of expenses related to our other research and development programs  and the timing of our commercialization of other products resulting in revenues 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
anti takeover provisions in our charter and by laws  our rights agreement and certain provisions of delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management 
also  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which may prohibit or delay large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
in addition  the rights issued under our rights agreement may be a substantial deterrent to a person acquiring or more of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors 
these provisions in our charter and by laws  rights agreement and under delaware law could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
we have not entered into any instruments for trading purposes 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that an increase in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to decrease 
to minimize this risk in the future  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
an immediate hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  the same hypothetical increase in interest rates as of december  would have resulted in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our investments 
due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
as of december   approximately of our total portfolio will mature in one year or less  with the remainder maturing in less than three years 
in connection with the purchase of our new facility in july  our wholly owned real estate subsidiary executed an acquisition and construction loan agreement that provides for up to million in borrowings at a floating interest rate indexed to day libor 
concurrent with that transaction  the subsidiary also entered into an interest rate cap agreement which limits exposure to interest rate increases above a certain threshold 
due to the decrease in interest rates since we entered into this interest rate cap  we currently do not believe that there is material interest rate risk exposure with respect to the loan agreement 
in addition  we believe that we have mitigated our risk relating to significant adverse fluctuations in interest rates with respect to borrowings under the loan agreement  and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
