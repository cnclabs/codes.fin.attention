in mid march  the united states appeared to be on the verge of war with iraq 
the company s business could be adversely impacted by such a war  primarily because of the potential impact on the company s airline leasing business 
since a substantial portion of airline travel is discretionary  the start of the war may result in travelers canceling or deferring their plans for air travel  the consequences of which could further deteriorate the financial condition of the company s airline customers 
during several airline companies filed for bankruptcy 
should a war start and airline conditions continue to deteriorate  additional airlines may file for bankruptcy 
because airlines threatening to file for bankruptcy or operating under bankruptcy protection have the flexibility to reduce their costs by voiding contracts and renegotiating existing business obligations  current and future threatened or actual airline bankruptcies could have an adverse impact on the company s revenue and financial results 
following the september  terrorists attacks  aviation insurers dramatically increased airline insurance premiums and reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage for liability to persons other than passengers for claims resulting from acts or war or terrorism war risk coverage 
the government has offered  and many carriers have accepted war risk insurance to replace commercial insurance for a limited period of time 
a war could cause premiums to increase even further or cause certain types of airline insurance to become unavailable or the government may refuse to extend the time period for which it will provide war risk insurance  which could increase the risks involved in the company s airline leasing business 
lastly  rising fuel prices caused by market conditions  including the threat of war or an actual war could cause financial distress for the company s customers  especially to those customers in the airline  chemical  and petroleum industries  which in turn could have an adverse impact on the company s revenues and financial results

the million facility which closed in july is intended to be utilized to meet short term funding requirements 
the million and million facilities were established as back up lines 
the revolving credit facilities contain various restrictive covenants  including an asset coverage test  requirements to maintain a defined minimum net worth and a certain fixed charges coverage ratio 
at december   gfc was in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the credit facilities 
as defined in the credit facilities  the net worth of gfc at december  was billion  which was in excess of the most restrictive minimum net worth requirement of billion 
additionally  the ratio of earnings to fixed charges as defined by the credit facilities was x for the december  period  in excess of the most restrictive agreement amount of x 
at december   all credit facilities were unused and available 
secured financings are comprised of the sale leaseback of railcars  loans secured by railcars and aircraft  technology nonrecourse financing  and a commercial paper cp conduit securitization facility 
the railcar sale leasebacks qualify as operating leases and the assets or liabilities associated with this equipment are not recorded on the balance sheet 
in december   gfc closed the million cp conduit securitization facility which can be renewed annually 
at december   no amounts had been funded through this facility 
gfc has a billion shelf registration for debt securities  of which million has been issued 
the availability of these funding options may be adversely impacted by certain factors including the global capital market environment and outlook as well as gfc s financial performance and outlook 
access to capital markets at competitive interest rates is partly dependent on gfc s credit rating as determined primarily by rating agencies such as standard poor s s p and moody s investor service moody s 
as of march   gfc s credit ratings on its long term unsecured debt were bbb and baa at s p and moody s  respectively 
gfc s credit ratings on its commercial paper were a and prime at s p and moody s  respectively 
on february   s p placed gfc s long term unsecured debt on credit watch with negative implications 
gfc s existing credit rating situation has increased the cost of borrowing from prior years 
also  gfc s access to the commercial paper market has been seriously constrained and gfc has experienced greater difficulty accessing the long term unsecured capital market on a cost efficient basis 
in  gfc arranged financing supported by the european credit agencies to fund gfc s airbus a aircraft deliveries

similar to gatx s balance sheet investments  these guarantees expose gatx to credit and market risk  accordingly gatx evaluates commitment and other contingent obligations using the same techniques used to evaluate funded transactions 
lease and loan payment guarantees generally involve guaranteeing repayment of the financing utilized to acquire assets being leased by an affiliate to customers  and are in lieu of making direct equity investments in the affiliate 
gatx is not aware of any event of default which would require it to satisfy these guarantees  and expects the affiliates to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy their lease and loan obligations 
asset residual value guarantees represent gatx s commitment to third parties that an asset or group of assets will be worth a specified amount at the end of a lease term 
over of the asset residual value guarantees are related to rail equipment 
based on known and expected market conditions  management does not believe that the asset residual value guarantees will result in any negative financial impact to gatx 
gatx and its subsidiaries are also parties to letters of credit and bonds 
no material claims have been made against these obligations 
at december   gatx does not expect any material losses to result from these off balance sheet instruments because performance is not anticipated to be required

restricted assets are defined as the subsidiary s equity  less intercompany receivables from the parent company  less the amount that could be transferred to the parent company 
the net asset restrictions of gfc result from covenants under its revolving credit agreements and indentures 
such restrictions are not expected to have an adverse impact on the ability of gatx to meet its cash obligations 
in  gatx contributed million to its qualified pension plans 
the company may make additional contributions to the plans in  but is not required to do so 
however  if investment returns underperform expectations  additional contributions may be necessary and could be material in amount 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
the company regularly evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and other relevant factors and circumstances 
the company considers the following as critical accounting policies operating lease assets and facilities operating lease assets and facilities are stated principally at cost 
assets acquired under capital leases are included in operating lease assets and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities 
provisions for depreciation include the amortization of the cost of capital leases 
operating lease assets and facilities are depreciated using the straight line method to an estimated residual value 
railcars  locomotives  aircraft  marine vessels  buildings and leasehold improvements are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
technology equipment is depreciated to an estimated residual value over the term of the lease contract 
the company periodically reviews the appropriateness of depreciable lives and residual values based on physical and economic factors  as well as existing market conditions 
impairment of long lived assets a review for impairment of long lived assets  such as operating lease assets and facilities  is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
estimated future cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including lease rates  lease term  operating costs  life of the asset and disposition proceeds 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
allowance for possible losses the purpose of the allowance is to provide an estimate of credit losses with respect to reservable assets inherent in the investment portfolio 
reservable assets include gross receivables  loans and finance leases 
gatx sets the allowance by assessing overall risk and total potential losses in the portfolio and by reviewing historical loss experience 
gatx charges off amounts that management considers unrecoverable from obligors or the disposition of collateral 
gatx assesses the recoverability of investments by considering factors such as a customer s payment history and financial position 
the allowance for possible losses is periodically reviewed for adequacy considering changes in economic conditions  collateral values  credit quality indicators and customer specific circumstances 
gatx believes that the allowance is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio as of december  because the allowance is based on judgments and estimates  it is possible that those judgments and estimates could change in the future  causing a corresponding change in the recorded allowance 
investments in affiliated companies investments in affiliated companies represent investments in domestic and foreign companies and joint ventures that are in businesses similar to those of gatx  such as commercial aircraft leasing  rail equipment leasing  technology equipment leasing and other business activities  including ventures that provide asset residual value guarantees in both domestic and foreign markets 
investments in to percent owned companies and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method and are shown as investments in affiliated companies 
certain investments in joint ventures that exceed ownership are not consolidated and are also accounted for using the equity method as gatx does not have effective or voting control of these legal entities 
the investments in affiliated companies are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted for gatx s share of the affiliate s undistributed earnings 
distributions  which reflect both dividends and the return of principal  reduce the carrying amount of the investment 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of new accounting pronouncements that may impact gatx s business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk gatx is exposed to certain market risks  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage these risks  gatx  pursuant to established and authorized policies  enters into certain derivative transactions  principally interest rate swaps  treasury derivatives and currency swaps 
these instruments and other derivatives are entered into for hedging purposes only 
gatx does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
gatx s interest expense is affected by changes in interest rates as a result of its use of variable rate debt instruments 
based on gatx s variable rate debt instruments at december   if market rates were to increase hypothetically by of gatx s weighted average floating rate  after tax interest expense would increase by approximately million in changes in certain currency exchange rates would also affect gatx s reported earnings 
based on reported earnings from continuing operations  a uniform and hypothetical strengthening in the us dollar versus applicable foreign currencies would decrease after tax income from continuing operations in by approximately million 
the interpretation and analysis of the results from the hypothetical changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates should not be considered in isolation  such changes would typically have corresponding offsetting effects 
for example  offsetting effects are present to the extent that floating rate debt is associated with floating rate assets
