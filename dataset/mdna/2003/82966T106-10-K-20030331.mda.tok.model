item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to future events or sirenza s future financial performance 
in some cases  forward looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may  will  should  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  estimate  potential  or continue  the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual events or results may differ materially from any forward looking statement as a result of various factors  including those described above under risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis below of sirenza s financial condition and results of operations are based upon sirenza s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires sirenza to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
sirenza bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
sirenza evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates to be made in the preparation of sirenza s consolidated financial statements 
investments in the first quarter of  sirenza converted an outstanding loan receivable of approximately million and invested cash of approximately million in global communication semiconductors  inc gcs  a privately held semiconductor foundry  in exchange for million shares of gcs series d preferred stock valued at per share 
sirenza s total investment of million represented approximately of the outstanding voting shares of gcs at the time of the investment 
the investment in gcs was within sirenza s strategic focus and intended to strengthen sirenza s supply chain for ingap and inp process technologies 
in connection with the investment  sirenza s president and ceo joined gcs s seven member board of directors 
sirenza accounted for its investment in gcs under the cost method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  as sirenza s investment was less than of the voting stock of gcs and sirenza cannot exercise significant influence over gcs 
the investment in gcs is classified as a non current asset on sirenza s consolidated balance sheet 
on a quarterly basis  sirenza evaluates its investment in gcs to determine if an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
factors that may cause an other than temporary decline in the value of sirenza s investment in gcs would include  but not be limited to  a degradation of the general business environment in which gcs operates  the failure of gcs to achieve certain milestones or a series of operating losses in excess of gcs then current business plan  the inability of gcs to continue as a going concern and a reduced valuation as determined by a new financing event 
there is no public market for gcs  and the factors mentioned above may require management to make significant judgments about the fair value of such securities 
if sirenza determines that an other than temporary decline in value has occurred  it will write down its investment in gcs to fair value 
such a write down could have a material adverse impact on sirenza s consolidated results of operations in the period in which it occurs 
for example  as of december   sirenza wrote down the value of its investment in gcs by million after determining that gcs had experienced an other than temporary decline in value for reasons described later in this discussion in our comparison of results of operations for and sirenza s ultimate ability to realize its investment in gcs in the future may be dependent on the market conditions surrounding the wireless communications industry and the related semiconductor foundry industry  as well as the public markets receptivity to liquidity events such as initial public offerings or mergers and acquisition activities 
loans receivable in the fourth quarter of  sirenza announced it was in discussions to acquire vari l company  inc  a designer and manufacturer of rf and microwave components and devices for use in wireless communications 
in connection with the acquisition discussions  sirenza agreed to provide vari l with a secured loan facility of up to million 
the loan facility is secured by substantially all of vari l s assets  including all intangible assets such as patents  trademarks and mask works 
in the event sirenza completes a purchase business combination with vari l  all outstanding loans under this facility will be included in the calculation of the purchase price 
at each balance sheet date in which loans from vari l remain outstanding  sirenza evaluates the loans for potential impairment 
sirenza s evaluation includes examining the financial condition of vari l  including the availability of vari l assets in which sirenza has a security interest 
if sirenza determines that its loans to vari l are impaired  sirenza will write down the loan receivable balance to fair value 
such a write down could have a material adverse impact on sirenza s consolidated results of operations in the period in which it occurs 
as of december   sirenza had funded vari l approximately million  which is recorded on sirenza s balance sheet as loans to vari l 
sirenza has concluded that none of this amount is impaired as of december  business combinations sirenza is required to allocate the purchase price of an acquired company to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development  or ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected net cash flows from acquired patented core technology  expected costs to develop the ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating net cash flows from the projects when completed  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
excess and obsolete inventories sirenza records provisions for excess inventories based on levels of inventory exceeding the forecasted demand of such products within specific time horizons  generally six months or less 
sirenza forecasts demand for specific products based on the number of products it expects to sell  with such assumptions dependent on its assessment of market conditions and current and expected orders from its customers  considering that orders are subject to cancellation with limited advance notice prior to shipment 
if forecasted demand decreases based on sirenza s estimates or if inventory levels increase disproportionately to forecasted demand  additional inventory write downs may be required  as was the case in when sirenza recorded additional provisions for excess inventories of million 
likewise  if sirenza ultimately sells inventories that were previously written down  sirenza would reduce the previously recorded excess inventory provisions which would have a positive impact on sirenza s cost of revenues  gross margin and operating results  as was the case in when sirenza sold a total of million of previously written down inventory products 
valuation of deferred tax assets sirenza records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
each quarter management evaluates the required criteria necessary to support deferred tax assets  including recoverable income taxes and sources of future taxable income  and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly 
increases or decreases in the valuation allowance serve to increase or decrease sirenza s income tax expense in the period such adjustments are recorded 
due to current and continuing uncertain economic conditions in sirenza s industry  management believes that as of december   it is more likely than not that sirenza s deferred tax assets will not be realized  and no net deferred tax assets are recorded on sirenza s balance sheet as of that date 
management will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in subsequent quarters 
if it is subsequently determined that some or all or sirenza s deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized  sirenza will reduce sirenza s valuation allowance in the quarter such determination is made 
for more information related to the valuation of sirenza s deferred tax assets  see the provision for income taxes discussion in our comparison of results of operations for and valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets sirenza records impairment charges for long lived assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives when impairment indicators exist and the related undiscounted future cash flows and fair values are less than the carrying value of such assets  as was the case in when sirenza recorded  of impairment charges on long lived assets 
future adverse changes in market conditions or changes in the estimated useful life of sirenza s long lived assets or intangible assets with finite useful lives could result in new impairment indicators  thereby possibly resulting in impairment charges in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts sirenza maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of sirenza s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
to date  sirenza has not experienced material losses as a result of sirenza s customers inability to pay us 
sales returns sirenza records estimated reductions to revenues for sales returns  primarily related to quality issues  at the time revenue is recognized 
while sirenza engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its foundry and packaging partners  sirenza s sales return obligations are affected by failure rates 
should actual product failure rates and the resulting return of failed products differ from sirenza s estimates  revisions to sirenza s sales return reserves may be required 
in addition to the above critical accounting policies sirenza considers the following accounting policies to be very important in the preparation of sirenza s consolidated financial statements restructuring charges sirenza recorded restructuring charges of million in the fourth quarter of   as an increase to goodwill  in the third quarter of  and  in the fourth quarter of with the assumption that sirenza would not sublease any of its excess facilities through the end of the respective lease term 
in the event that sirenza subleases any of these excess facilities  an adjustment to sirenza s restructuring accrual would be charged to income or goodwill in the period such a sublease occurred 
as of february   sirenza subleased one of its excess facilities and reduced its restructuring liability accordingly 
for more information related to sirenza s restructuring activities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
distributor revenue accounting sirenza recognizes revenues on sales to its distributors at the time its products are sold by its distributors to their third party customers 
at the end of each month  sirenza defers both the sale and related cost of sale on any product that has not been sold to an end customer 
sirenza records the deferral of the sale on any unsold inventory products at its distributors as a liability and records the deferral of the related cost of sale as a contra liability  the net of which is presented on sirenza s balance sheet as deferred margin on distributor inventory 
sirenza receives reports from its distributors indicating the sales value of inventory being held on behalf of sirenza  which is reconciled to sirenza s estimate of the sales value of inventory being held on behalf of sirenza  considering in transit inventory to and from sirenza s distributors and pricing adjustments 
overview sirenza is a leading designer of high performance rf components for communications equipment manufacturers 
sirenza s products are used primarily in wireless communications equipment to enable and enhance the transmission and reception of voice and data signals 
historically  sirenza s products meeting standard specifications widely adopted by communications equipment manufacturers have constituted a majority of sirenza s revenues and sirenza expects this trend to continue in the near term 
sirenza s products are also utilized in broadband wireline and terminal applications 
on august   sirenza s board of directors approved the acquisition of xemod  a california corporation and a designer and fabless manufacturer of rf power amplifier modules and components based on patented lateral double diffused transistor ldmos technology 
sirenza s results of operations include the effect of xemod from september   the date the acquisition closed 
the purchase price was approximately million in cash and accrued transaction costs  with additional cash consideration of up to approximately million to be paid upon the execution  by april   by sirenza of a qualified supply  development or licensing agreement with regard to the technology developed by xemod 
to be a qualified agreement  the agreement must provide for revenues to sirenza or its subsidiary with a net present value using a discount rate of of at least million  provide for a payment of at least million to sirenza upon execution and otherwise be reasonably acceptable to sirenza 
the additional amount payable of between zero and the maximum noted above is determined by applying a formula to the net present value of the revenue to sirenza provided for by the qualified agreement 
as of march   a qualified agreement had not been executed 
if the technology licensing objectives are achieved the liability related to the additional consideration will be recorded as additional goodwill or another element of the transaction 
the future cash payout of additional consideration  if any  will be payable within days following the date upon which technology licensing objectives are achieved 
sirenza funded the acquisition using cash on hand 
the acquisition is intended to strengthen sirenza s product portfolio of rf components  in particular  high power amplifier products 
on december   sirenza entered into an asset purchase agreement by and among sirenza  olin acquisition corp 
and vari l 
pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  acquisition sub will acquire substantially all of the assets of vari l and assume specified liabilities of vari l for approximately million in sirenza common stock and cash plus the forgiveness of million in secured bridge loans owed to sirenza by vari l as of december  the aggregate sirenza common stock and cash proceeds noted above are subject to adjustment based on the net asset adjustment  and will be adjusted downward for any additional funds  and related accrued interest  drawn by vari l on its existing secured bridge loan facility with sirenza 
the net proceeds remaining payable to vari l under the asset purchase agreement will be paid in a ratio of fifty five percent sirenza common stock and forty five percent cash 
for purposes of determining the number of shares of sirenza common stock to be issued at the closing only  the deemed value of one share of common stock according to the terms of the asset purchase agreement will be 
however  for accounting purposes of a business combination using the purchase method  the value of sirenza common stock to be issued to vari l as consideration will be based on market prices a few days before the closing of the transaction  but not include any dates after the date the business combination is consummated 
the purchase is anticipated to close in the second quarter of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement is subject to the approval of the shareholders of vari l  the effectiveness of a registration statement of sirenza on form s as declared by the securities and exchange commission and other customary closing conditions 
from to  sirenza operated under two business segments the standard products segment and the wireless infrastructure products segment 
at the beginning of  in response to the changes in the market place  sirenza reorganized to focus on end markets 
as a result of this reorganization  sirenza operated in three business segments through the date of the acquisition of xemod 
as a result of the acquisition  sirenza now operates in four business segments 
first is the wireless applications business area 
this business area is responsible for all wireless infrastructure activity  excluding high power amplifier products  both standard and specialized 
second is the wireline applications business area 
this business area is responsible for the development and marketing of wireline components to both cable television and fiber optics markets 
third is the terminals business area 
this business area focuses on customers who use sirenza s products for applications outside of sirenza s core markets of wireless and wireline infrastructure  such as cable television set top boxes and wireless video transmitters 
last is the integrated power products business area 
this business area focuses on high power amplifier products for wireless communication and networking infrastructure markets 
sirenza s results of operations include the integrated power products business area the historical operations of xemod from september   the date of sirenza s acquisition of xemod 
sirenza s wireless applications business area accounted for of net revenues in sirenza s wireline applications business area accounted for of net revenues in sirenza s terminals business area accounted for of net revenues in sirenza s integrated power products business area accounted for of net revenues in sirenza currently expects the relative percentage of net revenues attributable to the wireless applications business area to decrease slightly and the integrated power products business area to increase slightly in the near future 
sirenza sells its products worldwide through us based distributors and through its direct sales force 
in the past  sirenza also sold its products through a private label reseller who sold its products under its brand name  although there have not been any sales to this reseller in sirenza s products are also sold through a worldwide network of independent sales representatives whose orders are fulfilled either by sirenza s distributors or sirenza directly 
significant portions of sirenza s distributors end sales are made to their customers overseas 
sales to customers located in the united states represented approximately of net revenues in sales customers located outside of the united states represented of net revenues in sales to one customer located in sweden  ericsson  represented of net revenues in for sirenza s direct sales  private label sales if any and sales to sirenza s sales representatives  sirenza recognizes revenues when the product has been shipped  title has transferred  and no further obligations remain 
although sirenza has never experienced a delay in customer acceptance of its products  should a customer delay acceptance in the future sirenza s policy is to delay revenue recognition until a customer accepts the products 
revenues and the related cost of revenues from sirenza s distributors are deferred until the distributors resell the products to their customers 
two distributors  richardson electronics laboratories and avnet electronics marketing  accounted for a substantial portion of sirenza s net revenues in sales to richardson electronics laboratories represented of net revenues in sales to avnet electronics marketing represented of net revenues in richardson electronics laboratories and avnet electronics marketing distribute sirenza s products to a large number of end customers 
sirenza anticipates that sales through its distributors and to ericsson will continue to account for a substantial portion of its net revenues in the near term 
sales of sirenza s products using two of sirenza s process technologies accounted for a significant portion of sirenza s net revenues in sales of sirenza s gallium arsenide heterojunction bipolar transistor gaas hbt products accounted for of sirenza s net revenues in sales of sirenza s silicon germanium sige heterojunction bipolar transistor products accounted for of sirenza s net revenues in cost of revenues consists primarily of the costs of wafers from sirenza s third party wafer fabs  costs of packaging performed by third party vendors  costs of testing  costs associated with procurement  production control  quality assurance and manufacturing engineering 
sirenza subcontracts its wafer manufacturing and packaging and performs only final testing and tape and reel assembly at sirenza s facilities 
in late  sirenza made the decision to outsource a major portion of its production testing operations 
sirenza intends to begin the outsourcing of a portion of its production testing operations once unit volumes increase to a level that makes outsourcing economically attractive to subcontractors 
there are a number of factors influencing sirenza s gross margin 
historically  gross margins on sirenza s sales through sirenza s distributors  to private label resellers and sirenza s direct customers have differed materially from each other 
as a result  the relative mix of these sales affects sirenza s gross margin 
also  the gross margin on sales of sirenza s newer products are typically higher than the gross margin on sales of some of sirenza s older products 
as a result  the relative mix of new product sales compared to older product sales affects sirenza s gross margin 
in addition  sirenza offers a broad range of products in multiple technologies that have historically had different gross margins 
as a result  the relative mix of product sales by process technology and within each technology affects sirenza s gross margins 
in addition  sirenza s cost of revenues and gross margins may be negatively influenced by provisions for excess inventories  as was the case in when sirenza recorded provisions for excess inventories of million  and positively influenced by the sale of previously written down inventory products  as was the case in when sirenza sold million of previously reserved inventory products 
the following table illustrates the impact on cost of revenues of additions to written down inventories and sales of previously written down inventory products and also provides a schedule of the activity of sirenza s written down inventories in thousands year ended december  additions to written down inventories charged to cost of revenues sales of written down inventories with no associated cost of revenues dispositions of written down inventories via scrap and other written down inventories at end of period the million of written down inventories at december  relates to a large number of sirenza s parts within all of its product families  at all stages of inventory completion 
sirenza will ultimately dispose of written down inventories by either selling such products or scrapping them 
sirenza currently expects to continue to sell inventory products that are written down in  however  not at the level experienced in  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
similarly  sirenza anticipates that it will scrap additional written down inventories in the near term 
the sales of written down inventories in had a positive impact on sirenza s gross margin 
had this inventory been valued at its original cost when sold  sirenza s gross margin for the year ended december  would have been instead of  as reported 
as discussed above in critical accounting policies and estimates  sirenza records provisions for excess inventories based on levels of inventory exceeding the forecasted demand for such products within specific time horizons  generally six months or less 
sirenza forecasts demand for specific products based on the number of products it expects to sell  with such assumptions dependent on its assessment of market conditions and current and expected orders from its customers  considering that orders are subject to cancellation with limited advance notice prior to shipment 
as a result  estimating the future impact of additional provisions for excess inventories on sirenza s results of operations involves many uncertainties 
however  based on current levels of written down inventories  the mix of inventory products and current market conditions  sirenza does not expect to incur write downs of inventories in at the same levels as in  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
should excess inventories need to be written down in the future  sirenza s gross margin would be negatively affected 
also  sirenza s gross margin is traditionally lower in periods with less volume and higher in periods with high volume 
sirenza values inventories at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis  or market 
in periods in which volumes are low  sirenza s manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to fewer units  thereby decreasing sirenza s gross margin 
likewise  in periods in which volumes are high  sirenza s manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to more units  thereby increasing sirenza s gross margin 
sirenza does not recognize revenue or the related costs of revenue from sales to its distributors until shipment to the distributor s customer 
sirenza records the deferral of the sale on any unsold inventory products at its distributors as a liability and records the deferral of the related cost of sale as a contra liability  the net of which is presented on sirenza s balance sheet as deferred margin on distributor inventory 
as a result  the level of inventory at sirenza s distributors can affect sirenza s reported gross margin for any particular period 
in  circuit electronic industries public co  ltd  or cei  and mpi corporation packaged a significant majority of sirenza s products 
relatives of sirenza s founding stockholders own mpi corporation in manila  philippines 
although sirenza utilized three additional packaging subcontractors in  sirenza anticipates that cei and mpi will continue to account for a significant amount of its packaging in the near future 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in research and development  material costs for prototype and test units and other expenses related to the design  development and testing of sirenza s products and  to a lesser extent  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers 
sirenza expenses all of its research and development costs as they are incurred 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support functions  as well as costs associated with trade shows  promotional activities  advertising and public relations 
sirenza pays and expenses commissions to its independent sales representatives when revenues from the associated sale are recognized 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  information technology  and human resources personnel  insurance and professional fees 
ipr d consists of projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the date of the acquisition and for which no alternative future use exists  related to sirenza s acquisition of xemod 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development 
the fair value assigned to ipr d was determined using the income approach 
the income approach estimates costs to develop the purchased ipr d into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue estimates used to value the purchased ipr d were based on estimates of the relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by xemod 
the million of ipr d resulting from sirenza s acquisition of xemod consisted of three projects as follows semiconductor intellectual property related to the xemos ii ldmos process  or xemos ii  semiconductor intellectual property related to the xemos iii ghz ldmos process  or xemos iii  and module intellectual property of the xemos ii process that includes modules with xemos ii chips  or xemos ii module ip 
the development of these projects remains a significant risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and significant competitive threats from numerous companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists principally of planning  designing  experimenting and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on the high power amplifier rf market  and could have a material adverse impact on sirenza s business and operating results 
the following table summarizes key assumptions and the underlying valuations for the three ipr d projects described above related to sirenza s acquisition of xemod xemos ii xemos iii xemos ii module ip estimated fair value estimated of completion estimated cost to complete estimated completion date risk adjusted discount rate estimated revenue commencement year the assumptions primarily consist of an expected completion date for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  revenue and expense projections assuming the products have entered the market at a certain time  and discount rates based on the risks associated with the development life cycle of the in process technology acquired 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisition was completed and may result in impairment charges 
results of operations the following table shows selected consolidated statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  net revenues product revenues contract manufacturing revenues total net revenues cost of revenues cost of product revenues amortization of deferred stock compensation total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development exclusive of amortization of deferred stock compensation sales and marketing exclusive of amortization of deferred stock compensation general and administrative exclusive of amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of deferred stock compensation in process research and development amortization of acquisition related intangible assets restructuring and special charges impairment of investment in gcs total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net provision for income taxes net income loss comparison of and net revenues net revenues increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily the result of increased demand for sirenza s products by leading wireless equipment original equipment manufacturers  or oems  primarily in europe and asia 
sirenza increased its world wide customer sales support capabilities in by establishing a sales office in stockholm  sweden  and a customer support office in shenzhen  china to support sirenza s customer accounts 
also contributing to the increase in net revenues was a favorable mix of product sales in  as sales of sirenza s higher priced power amplifier products were approximately million in compared to million in sirenza also experienced a slight increase in net revenues in as a result of the acquisition of xemod  which closed on september  net revenues attributable to xemod subsequent to the closing of the acquisition totaled  partially offsetting the increases above were declines in net revenues from sirenza s private label reseller  minicircuits laboratories  who made no purchases in  and one direct customer  pace micro technology plc  as a result of downturns in the their businesses 
sales through sirenza s distributors totaled million  or of net revenues in compared to million  or of net revenues in sales to sirenza s direct customers totaled million  or of net revenues in  none of which was to sirenza s private label reseller 
sales to sirenza s direct customers totaled million  or of net revenues in  of which was to sirenza s private label reseller and was to its factory direct customers 
sales of sirenza s sige and ingap products were approximately of sirenza s net revenues in compared to in sales of sirenza s gaas products were approximately of sirenza s net revenues in compared to in cost of revenues cost of revenues decreased to million in from million in primarily as a result of lower provisions for excess inventories and related charges  which lowered costs by approximately million  and other contributory factors such as lower manufacturing spending as a result of cost reduction actions implemented in the second half of in addition  in  sirenza sold inventory products that were previously written down of approximately million 
as the cost basis for written down inventories is less than the original cost basis when such products are sold  cost of revenues associated with the sale will be lower  which results in a higher gross margin on that sale 
a significant majority of the previously written down inventory parts that were sold in related to a small number of parts within two product lines 
sirenza originally recorded provisions for excess inventories for these parts as a result of a rapidly declining demand for these products due to customer program cancellations 
subsequently  sirenza began receiving new orders for these parts which it did not anticipate at the time it wrote the inventories down 
sirenza expects to sell previously written down inventory products in future periods  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
the decrease in cost of revenues was partially offset by an increase in cost of revenues attributable to the acquisition of xemod  which added costs of approximately  subsequent to the date of acquisition  or september  operations personnel increased to at december  from at december  gross profit gross profit increased to million in from million in gross margin increased to in from in the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to lower provisions for excess inventories and other contributory factors such as the sale of previously written down inventories and lower manufacturing spending as a result of cost reduction actions implemented in the second half of sales of previously written down inventory products totaled million in which resulted in an increase to sirenza s gross margin of approximately 
had this inventory been valued at its original cost when sold  sirenza s gross margin would have been instead of  as reported 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease is primarily the result of abandoned and impaired research and development equipment and software charges of million incurred in the third quarter of  and other contributory factors such as lower salaries and salary related expenses  which reduced cost by approximately  and lower expenses for engineering materials 
research and development personnel increased to at december  from at december  sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease is primarily the result of lower advertising expenses  which reduced costs by approximately  and other contributory factors such as lower commissions to outside sales representatives  which reduced costs by approximately  partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in salaries and salary related expenses 
sirenza expects its sales and marketing expenses will increase in the near term  as commissions to outside sales representatives are expected to increase with an increase in sales  and a return to historical levels of advertising expenditures 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this increase is primarily attributable to higher professional fees  which added costs of approximately  professional fees increased in compared to as a result of higher legal fees associated with sirenza s investment in gcs  patent filings  the option exchange program and sirenza s class action lawsuit 
in addition  sirenza experienced higher fees associated with directors and officers insurance premiums 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees prior to sirenza s initial public offering  sirenza recorded deferred stock compensation within stockholders equity of approximately  in and million in  representing the difference between the deemed fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the exercise price of these options at the date of grant 
during the years ended december   and sirenza amortized million  million and million  respectively  of this deferred stock compensation 
sirenza will amortize the remaining deferred stock compensation over the vesting period of the related options  generally four years 
the amount of deferred stock compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could decrease if options for which accrued but unvested compensation has been recorded are forfeited  as was the case in when sirenza reduced the amount of deferred stock compensation expense to be recorded in future periods by  in process research and development 
in the third quarter of  sirenza recorded ipr d charges of million in connection with the acquisition of xemod 
projects that qualify as ipr d are those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and for which no alternative future use exists 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets 
in the third quarter of  sirenza acquired xemod for approximately million in cash and accrued transaction costs 
of the total purchase price   has been allocated to amortizable intangible assets including patented core technologies of  and internal use software of  sirenza is amortizing the patented core technologies on a straight line basis over a period of three to five years  which represents their estimated useful lives 
sirenza is amortizing the internal use software on a straight line basis over a period of three years  which represents its estimated useful life 
in the fourth quarter of  sirenza recorded amortization of  related to its acquired intangible assets 
restructuring and special charges 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of continued softness in the wireless telecommunications industry management of sirenza approved and committed to a restructuring plan including the termination of certain employees and exiting excess facilities 
accordingly  sirenza recorded a restructuring charge of  these costs are accounted for under eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
in third quarter of  in connection with the acquisition of xemod  management of sirenza approved and initiated plans to restructure the operations of the acquired xemod organization 
sirenza recorded  to eliminate certain duplicative facilities and for employee termination costs 
these costs are accounted for under eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with purchase business combinations 
these costs were recognized as a liability assumed in the purchase business combination and included in the allocation of the cost to acquire xemod and  accordingly  have been included as an increase to goodwill 
the restructuring charges recorded in the third quarter of are based on sirenza s restructuring plans that have been committed to by management 
in february of  sirenza began subleasing the facility that was exited as part of the restructuring related to the acquisition of xemod 
sirenza expects to receive a total of  over the next months from its sublessor 
accordingly  sirenza reduced its accrued restructuring liability and goodwill by this amount as of december  any further changes to the estimates of costs associated with executing the currently approved plans of restructuring for the xemod organization prior to september  would be recorded as an increase or decrease to goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of  sirenza approved a restructuring plan as companies throughout the worldwide telecommunication industry announced slowdowns or delays in the build out of new wireless and wireline infrastructure 
this resulted in lower equipment production volumes by sirenza s customers and efforts to lower their component inventory levels 
these actions by sirenza s customers resulted in a slowdown in shipments and a reduction in visibility regarding future sales and caused sirenza to revise its cost structure given the then revised revenue levels 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  sirenza incurred a restructuring charge of million related to a worldwide workforce reduction and consolidation of excess facilities 
at each balance sheet date  sirenza evaluates its restructuring accrual for appropriateness 
in the third quarter of  sirenza determined that  of its restructuring accrual was no longer appropriate as of september  and adjusted its restructuring liability accordingly 
the  restructuring liability adjustment was recorded through the same statement of operations line item that was used when the liability was initially recorded  or restructuring 
impairment of investment in gcs 
in the first quarter of  sirenza converted an outstanding loan receivable of approximately million and invested cash of approximately million in gcs  a privately held semiconductor foundry  in exchange for million shares of gcs series d preferred stock valued at per share 
sirenza s total investment of million represented approximately of the outstanding voting shares of gcs at the time of the investment 
the investment in gcs was within sirenza s strategic focus and intended to strengthen sirenza s supply chain for indium gallium phosphide ingap and indium phosphide inp process technologies 
in connection with the investment  sirenza s president and ceo joined gcs seven member board of directors 
sirenza accounted for its investment in gcs under the cost method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  as sirenza s investment was less than of the voting stock of gcs and sirenza cannot exercise significant influence over gcs 
the investment in gcs is classified as a non current asset on sirenza s consolidated balance sheet 
on a quarterly basis  sirenza evaluates its investment in gcs to determine if an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
factors that may cause an other than temporary decline in the value of sirenza s investment in gcs would include  but not be limited to  a degradation of the general business environment in which gcs operates  the failure of gcs to achieve certain performance milestones  a series of operating losses in excess of gcs business plan at the time of our investment  the inability of gcs to continue as a going concern or a reduced valuation as determined by a new financing event 
there is no public market for securities of gcs  and the factors mentioned above may require management to make significant judgments about the fair value of the gcs securities 
if sirenza determines that an other than temporary decline in value has occurred  sirenza will write down its investment in gcs to fair value 
such a write down could have a material adverse impact on sirenza s consolidated results of operations in the period in which it occurs 
in the first two quarters of following its investment in gcs  sirenza assessed its valuation of gcs against the factors identified above and concluded that an other than temporary impairment of its investment in gcs had not occurred 
these conclusions were reviewed in detail with sirenza s audit committee who concurred with management s conclusions 
these conclusions were supported at the end of the third calendar quarter of when sirenza understood that gcs was involved in a potential business combination  the terms of which would have preserved sirenza s investment in gcs at its original value 
in the fourth quarter of  sirenza assessed its valuation of gcs against the factors identified above and concluded that there were indicators of an other than temporary impairment of its investment in gcs 
factors which caused sirenza to make this determination included the cumulative effect of gcs s failure to meet its operating forecast for three successive quarters  the continued lack of improvement in the general environment for gcs s business  and sirenza s understanding that the potential business combination transaction identified in the third quarter of would not verifiably preserve the value of sirenza s investment in gcs 
accordingly  at the end of the fourth quarter of  sirenza estimated the current fair value of its investment in gcs 
sirenza considered several methodologies to adjust the fair value of its investment  and focused on three alternatives i reducing the gcs valuation by the same percentage drop in valuation incurred by a portfolio of comparable public companies during the same time period  ii reducing the gcs valuation to an estimate of the liquidation value of the company  and iii adjusting the gcs valuation so that its ratio of net book value to stock price was comparable to a portfolio of other comparable publicly traded companies 
in methods one and three  sirenza chose a portfolio of companies that shared either the same end market with gcs or had a similar business model as gcs 
also  in methods one and three  sirenza applied an appropriate private company discount 
after careful consideration  management concluded that using a price to book ratio was the most appropriate valuation methodology 
in coming to this conclusion  management considered that as a semiconductor foundry  a large portion of gcs value could be identified in its fixed asset investments  the ratio of net book value to stock price moderated some of the non company specific valuation factors built into public stock prices in the ten months sirenza had held gcs stock  gcs was a going concern  and the methodology was clear and repeatable 
using this methodology  sirenza calculated and recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of to reduce the value of its investment in gcs to estimated fair value 
these conclusions were reviewed in detail with sirenza s audit committee who concurred with management s conclusion 
the fair value of its investment in gcs has been estimated by sirenza s management  and may not be reflective of the value in a third party transaction 
the realizability of the balance of sirenza s investment in gcs is ultimately dependent on sirenza s ability to sell its gcs shares  for which there is currently no public market and may be dependent on market conditions surrounding the wireless communications industry and the related semiconductor foundry industry  as well as  public markets receptivity to liquidity events such as initial public offerings or merger and acquisition activities 
even if sirenza is able to sell its gcs shares  the sale price may be less than the carrying value of the investment  which could have a material adverse effect on sirenza s consolidated results of operations

comparison of and net revenues net revenues decreased to million in from million in sirenza s sales decline in this period was a general one  affecting all its sectors and products 
sirenza s sales decline was a direct reflection of an overall decline in the demand for radio frequency components throughout both the wireless and wireline industry  including changes in buying patterns by equipment manufacturers worldwide and delays in the next generation wireless infrastructure build out 
this decline was  in turn  due to the sharp contraction in the demand for wireless and wireline equipment by telecom carriers 
in benchmarking sirenza s decline in revenue against that of its competitors and its significant customers  the percentage decline sirenza has experienced is consistent with the slowdown in the wireless telecommunications industry 
sales through sirenza s distributors were of net revenues in and of net revenues in sales to sirenza s direct customers comprised of net revenues in  of which of net revenues were to sirenza s private label reseller and of net revenues were to sirenza s factory direct customers

these actions by sirenza s customers have resulted in a slowdown in sirenza s shipments and reduced sirenza s visibility regarding future sales 
the revenue decline has occurred across sirenza s channels  customer categories  products and technologies 
as a result of these trends  in the fourth quarter of  sirenza took action that resulted in a worldwide workforce reduction and consolidation of excess facilities that resulted in a million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of in addition  as a result of these trends and other changes in the market place  sirenza realigned its organizational structure to focus on strategic account sales and marketing efforts  centralized engineering  customer and solution business area management and revised sirenza s cost structure given sirenza s current revenue level

in  the above individuals filed their tax returns and refunded  to sirenza  representing the excess amount of bonus received compared to their actual federal and state tax liability 
sirenza recorded the receipt of the  as special charges in the statement of operations  consistent with its presentation in the preceding fiscal year

during the years ended december   and  sirenza amortized million  million and  respectively  of this deferred stock compensation 
sirenza will amortize the remaining deferred stock compensation over the vesting period of the related options  generally four years 
the amount of deferred stock compensation expense to be recorded in future periods was reduced by  in as a result of options for which accrued but unvested compensation had been recorded was forfeited

the purchase price was approximately million in cash and accrued transaction costs with additional cash consideration of up to approximately million to be paid upon the execution  by april   by sirenza of a qualified supply  development or licensing agreement with regard to the technology developed by xemod 
to be a qualified agreement  the agreement must provide for revenues to sirenza or its subsidiary with a net present value using a discount rate of of at least million  provide for a payment of at least million to sirenza upon execution and otherwise be reasonably acceptable to sirenza 
the additional amount payable of between zero and the maximum noted above is determined by applying a formula to the net present value of the revenue to sirenza provided for by the qualified agreement 
as of march   a qualified agreement had not been executed 
if the technology licensing objectives are achieved the liability related to the additional consideration will be recorded as additional goodwill or another element of the transaction 
the future cash payout of additional consideration  if any  will be payable within days following the date upon which technology licensing objectives are achieved 
sirenza funded the acquisition using cash on hand 
in the fourth quarter of  sirenza announced it was in discussions to acquire vari l company  inc  a designer and manufacturer of rf and microwave components and devices for use in wireless communications 
in connection with the acquisition discussions  sirenza agreed to provide vari l with a secured loan facility of up to million 
the loan facility is secured by substantially all of vari l s assets  including all intangible assets such as patents  trademarks and mask works 
the loan facility also provides for a portion of the principal amounts to be convertible into approximately of vari l s fully diluted common stock under certain conditions 
as of december   vari l had drawn down approximately million of the secured loan facility 
sirenza funded the secured loan facility using cash on hand 
in the event that the loan remains outstanding on september   the date of maturity  all principal and accrued interest are due and payable in full 
interest accrues at a rate per annum equal to 
as of december   vari l had violated the net operating loss financial covenant of the loan facility and the default interest rate of went into effect on january  vari l has also defaulted on a covenant requiring its rolling three month cash used in operations not to exceed  as of february  each of these defaults gives sirenza the right to discontinue funding and accelerate vari l s obligation to repay the loans outstanding thereunder 
while sirenza has not exercised its rights to date  it has reserved the right to do so in the future 
in the first quarter of  sirenza converted an outstanding loan receivable of approximately million and invested cash of approximately million in gcs  a privately held semiconductor foundry partner  in exchange for million shares of series d preferred stock valued at per share 
the impact of sirenza s investment in gcs on sirenza s cash  liquidity and capital resources amounted to million  plus forgone interest income that sirenza would have received of approximately  annually 
in the third quarter of  sirenza s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of sirenza s common stock from time to time based on the price per share of its common stock and general market conditions 
purchases may be made at management s discretion in the open market or in private transactions at negotiated prices 
in the third quarter of  sirenza repurchased  shares for an aggregate price of  sirenza plans to fund its repurchases from available working capital 
as of december   sirenza s anticipated operating lease and capital lease commitments and unconditional purchase obligations over the next five years and thereafter were as follows in thousands future minimum payments due total one year years years years operating lease commitments capital lease commitments unconditional purchase obligations sirenza currently anticipates that its current available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months  including secured loan fundings to vari l and amounts payable to vari l upon completion of sirenza s proposed purchase of substantially all of the assets of vari l  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
if sirenza requires additional capital resources to grow its business  execute its operating plans  or acquire complementary technologies or businesses at any time in the future  sirenza may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or secure lines of credit  which may result in additional dilution to its stockholders 
industry trends and market conditions in  companies throughout the worldwide telecommunication industry experienced slowdowns and delays in the build out of new wireless and wireline infrastructure 
this resulted in lower equipment production volumes by sirenza s customers and efforts to lower their component inventory levels 
these actions by sirenza s customers reduced sirenza s visibility regarding future sales and resulted in a slowdown in sirenza s shipments in however  in sirenza experienced a sequential increase in sales to equipment manufacturers and in particular to end customers located in europe and asia 
however  while net revenues increased in the fourth quarter of compared to both the fourth quarter of and second and third quarters of  which sirenza believes is an indication that the market for its products may have stabilized  sirenza does not at this time see any significant recovery in its end markets 
sirenza anticipates that any sales growth in the immediate future will depend on the achievement of market share gains and or the introduction of new product lines 
if the macro economic trends described above were to worsen again it would likely result in lower sales for sirenza s products 
significantly lower sales would likely lead to further provisions for excess inventories and further actions by us to reduce sirenza s operating expenses 
these actions could include  but would not be limited to  further reduction of sirenza s equipment value  further consolidation of facilities  and a further workforce reduction 
any or all of these actions could have a material adverse effect on the results of sirenza s operations and the market price of common stock

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk historically  sirenza s sales have been made to predominantly us based customers and distributors in us dollars 
as a result  sirenza has not had any material exposure to factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  sirenza continues to and expects in future periods to expand selling into foreign markets  including europe and asia 
because sirenza s sales are denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the us dollar could make its products less competitive in foreign markets 
at december   sirenza s cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of bank deposits  federal agency and related securities and money market funds issued or managed by large financial institutions in the united states and canada 
sirenza did not hold any derivative financial instruments 
sirenza s interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates can affect the interest earned on sirenza s cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
for example  a increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease sirenza s annual interest income by approximately
