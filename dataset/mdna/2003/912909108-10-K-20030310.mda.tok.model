item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations u 
s 
steel has five reportable operating segments flat rolled products flat rolled  tubular products tubular  u 
s 
steel kosice ussk  straightline source straightline and uss real estate real estate 
prior to december   the businesses of u 
s 
steel comprised an operating unit of usx corporation  now named marathon oil corporation marathon 
on december   u 
s 
steel was capitalized through the issuance of million shares of common stock to holders of usx u 
s 
steel group common stock steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one for one basis the separation 
for additional information on the separation  see note to the financial statements 
effective with the first quarter of  following the separation  u 
s 
steel established a new internal financial reporting structure  which resulted in a change in reportable segments from domestic steel and ussk to flat rolled  tubular and ussk 
in addition  u 
s 
steel revised the presentation of several items of income and expense within income loss from reportable segments 
net pension credits  costs related to former businesses and administrative expenses previously not reported at the segment level are now directly charged or allocated to the reportable segments and other businesses 
effective with the fourth quarter of  the straightline and real estate reportable segments  which were previously reflected in other businesses  were added 
the presentation of straightline and real estate as separate segments resulted from the application of quantitative threshold tests under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
rather than any fundamental change in the management or structure of the businesses 
the composition of the flat rolled  tubular and ussk segments remains unchanged from prior periods 
comparative results for and have been conformed to the current year presentation 
the flat rolled segment includes the operating results of u 
s 
steel s domestic integrated steel mills and equity investees involved in the production of sheet  plate and tin mill products 
these operations are principally located in the united states and primarily serve customers in the transportation including automotive  appliance  service center  conversion  container  and construction markets 
the tubular segment includes the operating results of u 
s 
steel s domestic tubular production facilities and an equity investee involved in the production of tubular goods 
these operations produce and sell both seamless and electric resistance weld tubular products and primarily serve customers in the oil  gas and petrochemical markets 
the ussk segment includes the operating results of u 
s 
steel s integrated steel mill located in the slovak republic  a production facility in germany  operations under facility management and support agreements in serbia  and equity investees  primarily located in central europe 
these operations produce and sell sheet  plate  tin  tubular  precision tube and specialty steel products  as well as coke 
ussk primarily serves customers in the central and western european construction  conversion  appliance  transportation  service center  container  and oil  gas and petrochemical markets 
the straightline segment includes the operating results of u 
s 
steel s technology enabled distribution business that serves steel customers primarily in the eastern and central united states 
straightline competes in the steel service center marketplace using a nontraditional business process to sell  process and deliver flat rolled steel products in small to medium sized order quantities primarily to job shops  contract manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers across an array of industries 
the real estate segment includes the operating results of u 
s 
steel s domestic mineral interests that are not assigned to other operating units  timber properties  and residential  commercial and industrial real estate that is managed or developed for sale or lease 
all other u 
s 
steel businesses not included in reportable segments are reflected in other businesses 
these businesses are involved in the production and sale of coal  coke and iron bearing taconite pellets  transportation services  and engineering and consulting services 
certain sections of management s discussion and analysis include forward looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting the businesses of u 
s 
steel 
these statements typically contain words such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects or similar words indicating that future outcomes are not known with certainty and are subject to risk factors that could cause these outcomes to differ significantly from those projected 
in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors  though not necessarily all such factors  that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in forward looking statements 
for discussion of risk factors affecting the businesses of u 
s 
steel  see supplementary data disclosures about forward looking statements on page critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of u 
s 
steel s financial condition and results of operations are based upon u 
s 
steel s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year 
management regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for deferred income taxes  potential tax deficiencies  environmental obligations  potential litigation claims and settlements  and assets and obligations related to employee benefits 
management estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from current expectations under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
pensions and other postretirement benefits opeb the recording of net periodic benefit costs credits for pensions and opeb are based on  among other things  assumptions of the expected annual return on plan assets  discount rate  and escalation of retiree health care costs 
changes in the assumptions or differences between actual and expected changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of u 
s 
steel s plans could cause net periodic benefit costs to increase or decrease materially from year to year as discussed below u 
s 
steel bases its estimate of the annual expected return on plan assets on the historical long term rate of return experienced by u 
s 
steel s plan assets  the investment mix of plan assets between debt  equities and other investments  and its view of market returns expected in the future 
based on a review of these factors at year end  u 
s 
steel has decreased the expected annual return on pension plan assets from in to in this decrease in the expected return will negatively affect the return on asset component of net periodic pension costs by approximately million in as compared to the investment performance of pension plan assets over the last three years will also unfavorably impact net periodic pension cost during and later years primarily through the use of a lower asset base in calculating the expected return on plan assets 
since the expected return on assets component of net periodic benefit cost is based upon a market related value that recognizes changes in fair value over three years  net periodic pension cost will also be progressively higher in and net periodic pension cost is expected to total million in as compared to a million credit before settlement charges in a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets for would have decreased or increased the net periodic pension cost by million 
at december   u 
s 
steel s two main pension plans had a fair market value of billion which was percent invested in equity securities  percent in debt securities and percent in all other investments 
u 
s 
steel determines the discount rate applied to pension and opeb obligations at each year end based on a number of external barometers used to measure the status of high quality bond rates consistent with the expected payout period of the obligations 
based on this evaluation at december   u 
s 
steel lowered the discount rate used to measure both pension and opeb obligations from to 
lower discount rates increase the actuarial losses of the plans and will unfavorably impact net periodic benefit costs by approximately million for pensions and million for opeb in principally due to the impact of required amortization amounts  which in recent years had not been a significant component of benefit costs 
total opeb costs in are expected to be approximately million  excluding multiemployer plans 
a percentage point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the net periodic pension and opeb costs by approximately million and million  respectively 
a percentage point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the net periodic pension and opeb costs by approximately million and million  respectively 
u 
s 
steel determines the escalation trend in per capita health care costs based on historical rate experience under u 
s 
steel s insurance plans and through consultation with health care experts 
for measurement purposes  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of in and remain at that level thereafter 
a percentage point increase in the escalation trend would have increased net periodic opeb costs by approximately million in a percentage point decrease in the escalation trend would have decreased net periodic opeb costs by approximately million in changes in the assumptions for expected annual return on plan assets and the discount rate do not impact the funding calculations used to derive minimum funding requirements for the pension plans 
based on preliminary funding valuations  u 
s 
steel s main pension plans are not expected to require cash funding for the plan year 
however  the lower returns on plan assets experienced in recent years may have a negative impact on funding for u 
s 
steel s pension plan for union employees in and later 
the timing and amount of any required future funding cannot be determined at this time 
for further cash flow discussion  see the liquidity section 
asset impairments u 
s 
steel evaluates the impairment of its property  plant and equipment on an individual asset basis or by logical groupings of assets 
asset impairments are recognized when the carrying value of those productive assets exceeds their aggregate projected undiscounted cash flows 
these undiscounted cash flows are based on management s long range estimates of market conditions and the overall performance associated with the individual asset or asset grouping 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if the probability of disposition of the assets differs from that previously estimated by management  additional asset write downs may be required 
taxes u 
s 
steel records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event that u 
s 
steel were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should u 
s 
steel determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the amount of deferred tax assets recorded as of december   was  million  net of an established valuation allowance of million 
u 
s 
steel expects to generate future taxable income to realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets 
u 
s 
steel makes no provision for deferred us and certain foreign income taxes on the undistributed earnings of ussk and other consolidated foreign subsidiaries because management intends to permanently reinvest such earnings in foreign operations 
as of december   the amount of undistributed earnings was approximately million 
if circumstances change and it is determined that earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future  a charge of up to million could be required 
any charge taken is contingent upon the amount of undistributed earnings that u 
s 
steel would plan to remit 
u 
s 
steel records liabilities for potential tax deficiencies 
these liabilities are based on management s judgment of the risk of loss should those items be challenged by taxing authorities 
in the event that u 
s 
steel were to determine that tax related items would not be considered deficiencies or that items previously not considered to be potential deficiencies could be considered as potential tax deficiencies as a result of an audit  tax ruling or other positions or authority an adjustment to the liability would be recorded through income in the period such determination was made 
environmental remediation u 
s 
steel provides for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures and are discounted in certain instances 
u 
s 
steel regularly monitors the progress of environmental remediation 
should studies indicate that the cost of remediation is to be more than previously estimated  an additional accrual would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made 
as of december   total accruals for environmental remediation were million 
management s discussion and analysis of income the principal drivers of u 
s 
steel s financial results are price  volume  product mix and costs 
to the extent that these factors are affected by industry conditions and the overall economic climate  revenues and income will reflect such conditions 
revenues and other income for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table dollars in millions revenues by product sheet and semi finished steel products    plate and tin mill products   tubular products raw materials coal  coke and iron ore other a income loss from investees net gains on disposal of assets other income total revenues and other income    a includes revenue from the sale of steel production by products  transportation services  steel mill products distribution  the management of mineral resources  the management and development of real estate  and engineering and consulting services 
total revenues and other income in increased by million from primarily due to higher shipments and average realized prices for domestic sheet products  the absence of the million impairment of receivables primarily from republic  which was included in  increased straightline shipments as a result of a full year of operations  and higher average realized prices for ussk  which were partially due to foreign exchange effects 
these were partially offset by reduced domestic tubular and plate shipment volumes 
total revenues and other income increased by million in from primarily due to the inclusion of ussk revenues for the full year  the inclusion of transtar revenues following the reorganization and higher income from investees relating to the gain on the transtar reorganization  partially offset by lower domestic sheet  tubular and plate shipment volumes  lower average realized prices for domestic sheet products  and the million impairment of receivables primarily from republic 
income loss from operations for the last three years was dollars in millions flat rolled tubular ussk straightline real estate total income loss from reportable segments other businesses income loss from operations before special items special items pension settlement losses asset impairments receivables asset impairments intangible asset costs related to separation costs related to fairless shutdown insurance recoveries related to uss posco fire a federal excise tax refund gain on vsz share sale reversal of litigation accrual gain on transtar reorganization environmental and legal contingencies asset impairments coal impairment and other costs related to investments in equity investees total income loss from operations a in excess of facility repair costs 
segment results for flat rolled the segment loss for flat rolled of million in reflected an improvement of million from the substantially decreased loss was primarily due to improved operating efficiencies  higher average realized prices and shipment volumes for sheet products  lower energy costs and cost saving initiatives 
flat rolled recorded a segment loss of million in  versus income of million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily due to lower sheet prices and reduced shipment volumes for sheet products  which resulted in less efficient operating rates and higher unit costs  lower results from tin operations during the phase out of operations at the fairless plant  higher than anticipated start up and operating expenses associated with the march acquisition of east chicago tin  and business interruption effects at uss posco following the cold mill fire in may 
segment results for tubular tubular segment income for was million  compared to million in the decline was primarily due to lower shipment volumes and lower average realized prices for tubular products 
segment income for tubular in reflected an improvement of million from primarily due to higher tubular prices during the first half of segment results for ussk ussk segment income for was million  a decrease of million compared to the decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on costs  higher freight costs  losses on conversion operations at sartid ad sartid in serbia and business development expenses associated with sartid and other expansion opportunities in europe  partially offset by higher average realized prices  which were in part due to favorable exchange rate effects 
the net currency exchange effect on total year income from operations was not material 
ussk segment income for the full year was million  compared to million in for the period following u 
s 
steel s acquisition of ussk on november  the increase was primarily due to u 
s 
steel s full year of ownership  changes in commercial strategy  strong customer focused marketing and a favorable cost structure 
segment results for straightline straightline recorded a segment loss of million in  its first full year of operations  compared with a loss of million in for the period following the start up of operations on october  these results reflect the early stage costs associated with building a new business  achieving market penetration  and creating the infrastructure for anticipated future growth 
segment results for real estate real estate segment income for was million  compared with million in the decrease primarily reflected lower mineral interest royalties 
real estate segment income for declined million from primarily due to a decline in land sales  partially offset by increases in mineral interest royalties 
results for other businesses income for other businesses for was million  a significant improvement from s loss of million 
the increase primarily reflected higher income from taconite pellet and coal operations  partially offset by lower results from coke operations 
the loss for other businesses for reflected a decline of million from income of million in mainly as a result of lower income from taconite pellet and coke operations  and a decline in income related to transtar 
these decreases were partially offset by improved results from coal operations due to improved operating and geological conditions and reduced depreciation following an impairment of coal assets in net periodic pension credit net periodic pension credits  which are primarily noncash and are included in income loss from operations  totaled million in  million in and million in the decrease of million from to was primarily due to higher settlement charges  which totaled million in  compared with million in the credit in was also negatively affected by a lower expected return on plan assets as a result of lower market related values of plan assets in the credit in also included million of termination expense due principally to a non union voluntary early retirement program offered in conjunction with the separation and a shutdown of a majority of the fairless plant 
the decrease of million in the net periodic pension credit from to was primarily due to the million effect of the transition asset being fully amortized in  an unfavorable change in the amortization of actuarial gains losses and million of termination expense 
for additional information on pensions  see note to the financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in as compared to the increase in was primarily due to the decrease in the net periodic pension credit as previously discussed  the impairment of remaining retiree medical cost reimbursements receivable from republic  increased legal and consulting expenses primarily due to the section trade cases and potential industry consolidation  and the ongoing expansion of straightline 
also contributing to the increase in were higher retiree medical costs primarily due to decreases in the discount rate  and higher escalation rates for medical expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million in as compared to was due to several factors  including the decrease in the net periodic pension credit previously discussed 
other contributing factors were the increase in costs in as a result of the full year inclusion of ussk costs  the inclusion of transtar costs following the reorganization  separation costs and the impairment of retiree medical cost reimbursements owed by republic 
items not allocated to segments pension settlement losses were related to retirements of personnel covered under the nonunion qualified pension plan  the non tax qualified pension plan and the non tax qualified executive management supplemental pension program 
the settlements occurred primarily as a result of a voluntary early retirement program which was completed in june asset impairments receivables were for charges related to reserves established against receivables exposure from financially distressed steel companies  primarily republic 
asset impairments intangible asset was for the impairment of an intangible asset in related to the five year agreement for ltv to supply u 
s 
steel with pickled hot bands entered into in conjunction with the acquisition of ltv s tin mill products business 
this impairment followed the discontinuation of ltv operations at east chicago 
costs related to separation were for u 
s 
steel s share of professional fees and expenses and certain other costs directly attributable to the separation in costs related to fairless shutdown resulted from the permanent shutdown of the pickling  cold rolling and tin mill facilities at the fairless plant in insurance recoveries related to uss posco fire represent u 
s 
steel s share of insurance recoveries in excess of facility repair costs for the cold rolling mill fire at uss posco  which occurred in may the final payment was received in december federal excise tax refund represents the recovery of black lung excise taxes that were paid on coal export sales during the period through during  u 
s 
steel received cash and recognized pre tax income of million  which is included in other income on the statement of operations 
of the million received  million represented interest 
the refunds resulted from a federal district court decision that found such taxes to be unconstitutional 
gain on vsz share sale represents the gain recognized in october when u 
s 
steel granted an option to purchase its shares of vsz and subsequently sold these shares 
reversal of litigation accrual represents the reversal in the first quarter of of a prior litigation accrual as a result of a final court ruling in u 
s 
steel s favor 
gain on transtar reorganization represents u 
s 
steel s share of the gain in because this was a transaction with a noncontrolling shareholder  transtar recognized a gain by comparing the carrying value of the businesses sold to their fair value 
see note to the financial statements 
environmental and legal contingencies relate to certain environmental and legal accruals 
asset impairments coal was for asset impairments at coal mines in alabama and west virginia in following a reassessment of long term prospects after adverse geological conditions were encountered 
impairment and other costs related to investments in equity investees represents charges to establish reserves against notes from republic and to record u 
s 
steel s share of republic special charges which resulted from the completion of a financial restructuring of republic 
net interest and other financial costs for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table dollars in millions net interest and other financial costs plus favorable adjustment to interest related to prior years taxes net interest and other financial costs adjusted to exclude above item adjusted net interest and other financial costs decreased million in as compared with  primarily due to lower average debt levels following the december  value transfer of million from marathon 
the change from to also reflects favorable foreign currency effects 
these effects were primarily due to remeasurement of ussk net monetary assets into the us dollar  which is the functional currency  and resulted in a net gain of million in compared to a net loss of million in adjusted net interest and other financial costs increased by million in as compared with this increase was largely due to higher average debt levels  which resulted from negative cash flow and the elective funding for employee benefits and the acquisition of ussk  both of which occurred in the fourth quarter of the income tax benefit in was million  compared with a benefit of million in  and a provision of million in the tax benefit in included a million deferred tax benefit associated with the transtar reorganization 
the decrease in the tax benefit from to was primarily due to reduced pre tax losses from domestic operations 
the change to a tax benefit in as compared to a tax provision in was primarily the result of losses from domestic operations reported in the tax benefits in and reflected pre tax losses from domestic operations and pre tax income from foreign operations for which virtually no income tax provision was recorded 
the slovak income tax act provides an income tax credit which is available to ussk if certain conditions are met 
in order to claim the tax credit in any year  of ussk s sales must be export sales and ussk must reinvest the tax credits claimed in qualifying capital expenditures during the five years following the year in which the tax credit is claimed 
the provisions of the slovak income tax act permit ussk to claim a tax credit of of ussk s tax liability for years through and for the years through management believes that ussk fulfilled all of the necessary conditions for claiming the tax credit for through as a result of claiming these tax credits and certain tax planning strategies to reinvest earnings in foreign operations  virtually no income tax provision is recorded for ussk income 
if circumstances change and it is determined that earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future  a charge would be required to record the deferred tax liability for the amounts planned to be remitted 
in october  a tax credit limit was negotiated by the slovak government as part of an agreement required for the slovak republic s entry into the european union eu 
effective upon the slovak republic s entry into the eu  the agreement will limit to million the total tax credit to be granted to ussk during the period through the impact of the tax credit limit is expected to be minimal since slovak tax laws have been modified and tax rates have been reduced since the acquisition of ussk 
the agreement also places limits upon total production and export sales to the eu  allowing for modest growth during the period covered by the investment incentive 
management believes that the agreement will not have a significant impact on future ussk production and results of operations 
the issue of certain subsidies or incentives to the steel industry is the subject of ongoing discussions at the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd 
it is possible that these discussions could result in the adoption of an oecd agreement which could negatively impact ussk s tax credit 
net income in was million  compared with a net loss of million in and a net loss of million in the changes primarily reflected the factors discussed above 
management s discussion and analysis of operations flat rolled shipments were million tons in  million tons in and million tons in tubular shipments were million tons in  million tons in and million tons in domestic shipments in were affected by a weak domestic economy  which reduced demand for sheet  plate and tubular products 
high import levels impacted all three years 
exports accounted for approximately of u 
s 
steel s domestic shipments in  and ussk shipments were million net tons in  million net tons in and million net tons in in the short period following the acquisition 
domestic raw steel production was million tons in  compared with million tons in and million tons in domestic raw steel production averaged of capability in  compared with of capability in and of capability in in  domestic raw steel production was negatively affected by poor market conditions during the first quarter  as well as the acceleration into the fourth quarter of some blast furnace repair work that was originally scheduled to occur in in  domestic raw steel production was negatively impacted by poor economic conditions and the high level of imports 
in  domestic raw steel production was negatively impacted by a planned reline at the gary works no 
blast furnace in july because of market conditions  u 
s 
steel limited its domestic production by keeping the gary works no 
blast furnace out of service until february u 
s 
steel s stated annual domestic raw steel production capability was million tons in  and ussk raw steel production was million tons in and million tons in  or and  respectively  of ussk s stated annual raw steel production capability of million net tons 
the domestic steel industry is restructuring after many years of oversupply and low prices attributable largely to excess imports  which resulted in significant capacity closures starting in late and led to the introduction of section import tariffs in march the combination of capacity closures  trade restrictions and the imposition of tariffs led to a recovery of steel prices from year lows in late and early u 
s 
steel benefited in from reduced domestic supply resulting from the temporary or permanent closure of steelmaking capacity  as well as the section remedies announced by president bush on march  despite the trade remedies  steel imports to the united states accounted for an estimated of the domestic steel market in  compared to and  for and  respectively 
in  imports of steel pipe and cold rolled sheets decreased and  respectively  compared to  and imports of hot rolled sheets and galvanized sheets increased and  respectively  compared to remedies under section of the trade act of became effective for imports entering the us on and after march   and are intended to provide protection against imports from certain countries  but there are products and countries not covered and imports of these exempt products or of products from these countries may still have an adverse effect upon u 
s 
steel s revenues and income 
through august  the us department of commerce and the office of the united states trade representative had granted exclusions from the section remedies for many products  and another round of processing requests for exclusion is in process 
the exclusions impact a number of products produced by u 
s 
steel and have weakened the protection initially provided by this relief 
additionally  as initially imposed  the remedies decrease each year they are in effect 
for flat rolled products  the tariff decreases from in the first year to in the second year and in the third year  and the quota for slab imports that can enter the united states without imposition of the section tariff increases from million net tons in the first year to million net tons in the second year and million net tons in the third year  although the quantity of slabs that can actually enter the country free of tariffs is substantially larger than that amount due to exemptions of various slab products and exemptions of certain countries that ship slabs 
various countries have challenged president bush s action with the world trade organization wto and have taken other actions responding to the section remedies 
the wto is expected to announce its initial decision on the challenges filed against the section action by april in addition  as provided by president bush when he announced the section action in march  the us international trade commission will conduct a mid term review in the third quarter of and recommend to the president whether the remedies should remain in effect 
at the same time  the bush administration has continued discussions at the oecd aimed at the reduction of inefficient steel production capacity and the elimination and limitation of certain subsidies to the steel industry throughout the world 
on march   the canadian international trade tribunal citt initiated a safeguard inquiry to determine whether imports of certain steel goods from countries  including the us  had injured the canadian steel industry 
on july   the citt announced its determination that the canadian steel industry had been injured by reason of imports of certain products including the following which are made by u 
s 
steel cut to length plate  cold rolled steel sheet and standard pipe up to od on august   the citt announced that it was recommending as a remedy a three year quota  with tariffs imposed on tonnages exceeding the quota 
this resulted in quota levels for the us which are lower than shipments 
for shipments exceeding the quota levels  tariffs would be imposed ranging from in the first year  in the second year and in the third year 
the citt s remedy recommendations were forwarded to the ministry of finance  but a final decision regarding a remedy has not yet been made 
on december   the european commission commenced an anti dumping investigation concerning hot rolled coils imported into the eu from the slovak republic and five other countries 
on january   the commission issued a final disclosure advising of its determinations relative to the dumping and injury margins applicable to those imports 
the commission s findings set the dumping margin applicable to those imports at and the injury margin at 
ussk is currently in discussions with the commission regarding the possibility of entering into a price undertaking agreement which would set minimum prices for future shipments of hot rolled coils into the eu 
if no price undertaking agreement is reached  at the conclusion of these proceedings which must occur by march   duties equal to the injury margin of will be imposed upon hot rolled coils shipped by ussk into the eu 
all anti dumping measures  including any price undertaking agreement  will be terminated at such time that slovakia becomes a member of the eu  which is currently anticipated to occur in may definitive measures were recently announced in a separate safeguard trade action commenced by the european commission 
in that proceeding  which is similar to the us section proceedings  quota tariff measures were announced relative to the import of certain steel products into the eu 
ussk is impacted by the quota tariff measures on four products non alloy hot rolled coils  hot rolled strip  hot rolled sheet and cold rolled flat products 
shipment quotas were set for all four products 
the shipment quotas applicable to the first year of the measure were set at above the average shipments during the period an additional will be added to the shipment quotas applicable to the remainder of the safeguard measure period 
the shipment quotas on all products  other than non alloy hot rolled coils  are country specific 
the non alloy hot rolled coil quota is a global quota 
if the shipment quotas are exceeded  tariffs will be imposed 
the tariffs which would apply to shipments into the eu through march   are for non alloy hot rolled coils and for the other three products 
for the period march   through march   these tariffs will be reduced to and  respectively 
on march   these tariffs will again be reduced to and  respectively 
the safeguard measures are scheduled to expire on march  these measures will be terminated at such time that slovakia becomes a member of the eu 
safeguard proceedings similar to those pursued by the european commission have recently been commenced by poland  hungary and the czech republic 
provisional quota tariff measures have been imposed in poland and hungary 
to date  the czech republic has neither imposed provisional safeguard measures nor announced definitive measures 
the impact on ussk of these trade actions in the eu and central europe cannot be predicted at this time 
however  in light of market opportunities elsewhere  recent developments in the eu hot rolled coil anti dumping case and ussk s experience operating under the safeguard measures in place in the eu  poland and hungary  it appears unlikely that these matters will have a material adverse effect on ussk s operating profit in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  cash flows and liquidity financial condition sfas no 
employer s accounting for pensions provides that if  at any plan measurement date  the fair value of plan assets is less than the plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo  the sponsor must establish a minimum liability at least equal to the amount by which the abo exceeds the fair value of the plan assets and any pension asset must be removed from the balance sheet 
the sum of the liability and pension asset is offset by the recognition of an intangible asset and or as a direct charge to stockholders equity  net of tax effects 
such adjustments have no direct impact on earnings per share or cash 
at december   the fair value of plan assets for the pension plan for union employees union plan was billion 
based on asset values as of december   the abo for this plan exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million 
consequently  required minimum liability adjustments were recorded  resulting in the recognition of an intangible asset of million and a charge to equity  net of related tax effects  of million at december  current assets at year end increased million from year end primarily due to increased inventory balances related to higher operating rates and the continuing expansion of straightline  higher trade receivables resulting from increased sales volumes in late as compared to the latter part of  and an increase in cash and cash equivalents 
these were partially offset by a decline in related party receivables mainly as a result of lower shipments and changes in the shipment mix to uss posco 
net property  plant and equipment at year end decreased million from year end primarily due to capital spending that was million lower than depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the pension asset at year end decreased  million from year end primarily reflecting the elimination of the prepaid pension asset related to the union plan 
the intangible pension asset of million at december   resulted from the minimum liability adjustments that were recorded for the union plan 
other noncurrent assets of million at year end increased million from year end mainly as a result of an increase in restricted cash deposits primarily used to collateralize letters of credit to provide financial assurance 
current liabilities at year end increased million from year end primarily due to an increase in accounts payable as a result of higher operating levels in late as compared to the same period in  and higher accrued taxes  partially offset by lower accounts payable to related parties primarily due to payment of a million cash settlement to marathon in accordance with the terms of the separation 
long term debt at december   was  million  million lower than year end the decrease in debt was primarily due to a repayment on the ussk loan in april deferred income taxes at december   reflected a decrease of million from december  the change primarily resulted from the establishment of federal and state deferred tax assets related to the adjustment to the minimum liability for the union plan and the related intangible asset 
employee benefits at december   increased million from year end primarily as a result of the million minimum liability recorded for the union plan

cash flows net cash provided from operating activities was million in  a decrease of million from absent the favorable effects of the million intergroup tax settlements from marathon in as described below  net cash provided from operating activities in reflected an improvement of million from this improvement primarily resulted from higher net income  partially offset by increased working capital requirements primarily as a result of higher operating levels 
net cash provided from operating activities was million in  compared with net cash used in operating activities of million in the significant improvement was primarily due to the receipt of favorable intergroup tax settlements from marathon totaling million in the period compared to a favorable intergroup settlement of million in the period and the absence of million of elective contributions to a voluntary employee benefit association veba trust and to a non union retiree life insurance trust 
the million tax settlement is reflected in net cash provided by operating activities primarily as favorable working capital changes of million related to the settlement of the income tax receivable established in arising from tax attributes primarily generated in the year  increases in net income of million for tax benefits generated by u 
s 
steel in  and net increases in all other items net of million for state tax benefits generated in the last two items were included in the million settlement with marathon  which occurred in as a result of the separation 
absent these intergroup tax settlements in and and the million of elective contributions in to a veba trust and to a non union retiree life insurance trust  net cash used in operating activities decreased by million 
cash payments of employee benefit liabilities were lower in because million was paid from assets held in trust  compared to million in this change was primarily the result of approximately million of funds from the veba trust being used to pay retiree medical and life insurance benefits for united steelworkers of america uswa retirees in in addition  working capital improved 
these improvements were partially offset by decreased net income 
net cash used in operating activities in was million and reflected the million elective contribution to a veba trust  a million elective contribution to a non union retiree life insurance trust and an income tax receivable from marathon of million 
these unfavorable effects were partially offset by a million income tax settlement with marathon received in primarily for the year in accordance with the group tax allocation policy 
the million veba trust contribution has provided u 
s 
steel with the flexibility to pay ongoing costs of providing uswa retiree health care and life insurance benefits from the veba trust instead of from corporate cash flow 
at december   the company had million of the million contribution remaining to offset future benefit payments and required veba contributions

this forward looking statement is based on assumptions  which can be affected by among other things levels of cash flow from operations  general economic conditions  business conditions  availability of capital  whether or not assets are purchased or financed by operating leases  and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions  explosions or fires  which could delay the timing of completion of particular capital projects 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from current expectations in the forward looking statement

restricted cash deposits of million in were mainly used to collateralize letters of credit to meet financial assurance requirements 
investees return of capital in of million reflected a return of capital on the investment in stock of vsz 
net change in attributed portion of marathon consolidated debt and other financial obligations was a decrease of million in compared to an increase of  million in the decrease in primarily reflected the net effects of cash provided from operating activities less cash used for investing activities and dividend payments 
the increase in primarily reflected the net effects of cash used in operating activities  including a contribution to a veba trust  cash used in investing activities  dividend payments and preferred stock repurchases 
repayment of specifically attributed debt in of million was primarily due to the termination and repayment of the accounts receivable facility  which was accounted for as secured borrowing and specifically attributed to u

ussr can sell an undivided interest in these receivables to certain commercial paper conduits 
ussr pays the conduits a discount based on the conduits borrowing costs plus incremental fees  certain of which are determined by credit ratings of u

steel 
fundings under the facility are limited to the lesser of eligible receivables or million 
eligible receivables exclude certain obligors  amounts in excess of defined percentages for certain obligors  and amounts past due or due beyond a defined period 
in addition  eligible receivables are calculated by deducting certain reserves  which are based on various determinants including concentration  dilution and loss percentages  as well as the credit ratings of u

the new notes received in the exchange are identical in all material aspects to the tendered notes except that the new notes have been registered under the securities act of  as amended 
as of december   the aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding was million 
the senior notes impose limitations on u

steel s ability to make restricted payments 
restricted payments under the indenture include the declaration or payment of dividends on capital stock  the purchase  redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of capital stock  the retirement of any subordinated obligations prior to their scheduled maturity  and the making of any investments other than those specifically permitted under the indenture 
in order to make restricted payments  u 
s 
steel must satisfy certain requirements which include a consolidated coverage ratio based on ebitda and consolidated interest expense for the four most recent quarters 
in addition  the total of all restricted payments made since the senior notes were issued  excluding up to million of dividends paid on common stock through the end of  cannot exceed the cumulative cash proceeds from the sale of capital stock and certain investments plus of consolidated net income from october   through the most recent quarter end treated as one accounting period  or  if there is a consolidated net loss for the period  less of such consolidated net loss

steel s ability to continue to meet the consolidated coverage ratio and have amounts available under the calculation or one of the exclusions just discussed 
the senior notes also impose other significant restrictions on u 
s 
steel such as the following limits on additional borrowings  including limiting the amount of borrowings secured by inventories or accounts receivable  limits on sale leasebacks  limits on the use of funds from asset sales and sale of the stock of subsidiaries  and restrictions on our ability to invest in joint ventures or make certain acquisitions 
the inventory facility imposes additional restrictions on u

steel must meet an interest expense coverage ratio of at least to through march   and to thereafter  and a debt to ebitda leverage ratio of no more than to through december   to through march   to through june   to through september   to through march   and to thereafter  limitations on capital expenditures  and restrictions on investments 
if these covenants are breached or if u 
s 
steel fails to make payments under our material debt obligations or the receivables purchase agreement  creditors would be able to terminate their commitments to make further loans  declare their outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and foreclose on any collateral  and it may also cause termination events to occur under the receivables purchase agreement and a default under the senior notes 
additional indebtedness that u

steel may incur in the future may also contain similar covenants  as well as other restrictive provisions 
cross default and cross acceleration clauses in the receivables purchase agreement  the inventory facility  the senior notes and any future additional indebtedness could have an adverse effect upon our financial position and liquidity

steel was in compliance with all of its debt covenants at december  on february   u 
s 
steel sold million shares of series b preferred 
the company also granted the underwriters an over allotment option to purchase up to an additional  shares of series b preferred 
the series b preferred were issued under outstanding universal shelf registration statements 
proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes  including funding working capital  financing potential acquisitions  debt reduction and voluntary contributions to employee benefit plans 
dividend payments related to the million shares of series b preferred will be approximately million per year 
these dividends will be considered restricted payments under the senior note covenants described above  however  the amount u 
s 
steel has available to make restricted payments increased by the million of net proceeds received from the sale of the series b preferred 
the number of common shares that could be issued upon conversion of the million shares of series b preferred ranges from approximately million shares to million shares  based upon the timing of the conversion and the market price of u

steel has utilized surety bonds  trusts and letters of credit to provide financial assurance for certain transactions and business activities 
the total amount of active surety bonds  trusts and letters of credit currently being used for financial assurance purposes is approximately million 
events over the last year have caused major changes in the surety bond market including significant increases in surety bond premiums and reduced market capacity 
these factors  together with our non investment grade credit rating  have caused u 
s 
steel to replace some surety bonds with other forms of financial assurance 
the use of other forms of financial assurance and collateral have a negative impact on liquidity

the disputes involve property values and tax rates and are in various stages of administrative appeals 
u

steel is contingently liable  as well as obligations relating to industrial development and environmental improvement bonds and notes in the amount of million that were assumed by u 
s 
steel from marathon  may be declared immediately due and payable 
if that occurs  u 
s 
steel may not be able to satisfy such obligations 
in addition  if marathon loses its investment grade ratings  certain of these obligations will be considered indebtedness under the senior notes indenture and for covenant calculations under the inventory facility 
this occurrence could prevent u

steel accrues an annual cost for these benefit obligations under plans covering its active and retiree populations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these obligations will require corporate cash in future years to the extent that trust assets are restricted or insufficient and to the extent that company contributions are required by law or union labor agreement 
amounts in the year through reflect our current estimate of corporate cash outflows and are net of the use of funds available from a veba trust 
the accuracy of this forecast of future cash flows depends on various factors such as actual asset returns  the mix of assets within the asset trusts  medical escalation and discount rates used to calculate obligations  the availability of surplus pension assets allowable for transfer to pay retiree medical claims and company decisions or veba restrictions that impact the timing of the use of trust assets 
also  as such  the amounts shown could differ significantly from what is actually expended and  at this time  it is impossible to make an accurate prediction of cash requirements beyond five years 
g amount of contractual cash obligations is not determinable because other post retirement benefit cash obligations are not estimable beyond five years  as discussed in f above

future requirements for u

steel s business needs  including the funding of capital expenditures  debt service for outstanding financings  and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies  are expected to be financed by a combination of internally generated funds including asset sales  proceeds from the sale of stock  borrowings and other external financing sources 
however  there is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient operating cash flow or that external financing sources will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
if there is a prolonged delay in the recovery of the manufacturing sector of the us economy  u 
s 
steel believes that it can maintain adequate liquidity through a combination of deferral of nonessential capital spending  sales of non strategic assets and other cash conservation measures 
u

steel s ability to avail itself in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward looking statements are based on currently available information

steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
in recent years  these expenditures have been mainly for process changes in order to meet clean air act obligations  although ongoing compliance costs have also been significant 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of u 
s 
steel s products and services  operating results will be adversely affected 
u 
s 
steel believes that its major domestic integrated steel competitors are confronted by substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such competitors is materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on u 
s 
steel s competitive position with regard to domestic mini mills and some foreign steel producers and producers of materials which compete with steel  which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 
in addition  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods 
ussk is subject to the laws of the slovak republic 
the environmental laws of the slovak republic generally follow the requirements of the eu  which are comparable to domestic standards

a rcra corrective action program has been initiated at gary works and fairfield works 
until the studies are completed at these facilities  u 
s 
steel is unable to estimate the total cost of remediation activities that will be required 
on october   a final administrative order on consent was issued by the us environmental protection agency epa addressing corrective action for solid waste management units throughout gary works 
this order requires u 
s 
steel to perform a rcra facility investigation rfi and a corrective measure study cms at gary works 
the current conditions report  u

steel s first deliverable  was submitted to the epa in january and was approved by the epa in phase i rfi work plans have been approved for the coke plant  the process sewers  and background soils at the site  along with the approval of one self implementing interim stabilization measure 
another eight phase i rfi work plans have been submitted for epa approval  thereby completing the phase i requirement  along with two phase ii rfi work plans and one further self implementing interim stabilization measure 
the costs of these studies are estimated to be million 
until they are completed  it is impossible to assess what additional expenditures will be necessary 
at gary works  u 
s 
steel has agreed to close three hazardous waste disposal sites located on plant property 
the d disposal site and a nearby refuse area will be closed collectively 
a corrective action management unit camu for the west end maintenance area of gary works has been proposed that will include wastes from the d and t disposal sites 
total costs to close d  d  t and the refuse area are estimated to be million 
in january  u

steel commenced negotiations with the epa regarding the terms of an administrative order on consent  pursuant to the rcra  under which u 
s 
steel would perform a rfi and a cms at its fairless plant 
a phase i rfi report was submitted during the third quarter of a phase ii iii rfi will be submitted following epa approval of the phase i report 
the rfi cms will determine whether there is a need for  and the scope of  any remedial activities at the fairless plant

steel where it has received information requests or other indications that it may be a prp under cercla but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability or make any judgment as to the amount thereof 
there are also additional sites related to u 
s 
steel where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes  both federal and state  or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation 
at many of these sites  u 
s 
steel is one of a number of parties involved and the total cost of remediation  as well as u 
s 
steel s share thereof  is frequently dependent upon the outcome of investigations and remedial studies 
u 
s 
steel accrues for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise  charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required

steel s estimated share of these costs is million 
new or expanded environmental requirements  which could increase u 
s 
steel s environmental costs  may arise in the future 
u 
s 
steel intends to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment  but since many of them are not fixed or presently determinable even under existing legislation and may be affected by future legislation  it is not possible to predict accurately the ultimate cost of compliance  including remediation costs which may be incurred and penalties which may be imposed 
however  based on presently available information  and existing laws and regulations as currently implemented  u 
s 
steel does not anticipate that environmental compliance expenditures including operating and maintenance and remediation will materially increase in u 
s 
steel s environmental capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million in primarily related to projects at ussk approximately million  gary works and fairfield works 
predictions beyond can only be broad based estimates  which have varied  and will continue to vary  due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements  the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies to remediate sites  among other matters 
based upon currently identified projects  u 
s 
steel anticipates that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately million in including million for ussk  however  actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed 
u 
s 
steel has been and is a defendant in a large number of cases in which approximately  claimants actively allege injury resulting from exposure to asbestos 
nearly all of these cases involve multiple defendants 
these claims fall into three major groups claims made under certain federal and general maritime law by employees of the great lakes fleet or intercoastal fleet  former operations of u 
s 
steel  claims made by persons who performed work at u 
s 
steel facilities  and claims made by industrial workers allegedly exposed to an electrical cable product formerly manufactured by u 
s 
steel 
to date  all actions resolved have been either dismissed or settled for immaterial amounts 
in  u 
s 
steel disposed of claims from approximately  claimants with aggregate total payments of approximately  and over  cases were administratively dismissed 
it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters  however  based upon present knowledge  management believes that it is unlikely that the resolution of the pending actions will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
among the factors that management considered in reaching this conclusion are that u 
s 
steel has been subject to a total of approximately  asbestos claims over the last years that have been administratively dismissed or are inactive due to the failure of the claimants to present any medical evidence supporting their claims  that over the last several years the total number of pending claims has remained steady  that it has been many years since u 
s 
steel employed maritime workers or manufactured electrical cable and u 
s 
steel s history of trial outcomes  settlements and dismissals 
this statement of belief is a forward looking statement 
predictions as to the outcome of pending litigation are subject to substantial uncertainties with respect to among other things factual and judicial determinations  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed in this forward looking statement 
u 
s 
steel is the subject of  or a party to  a number of pending or threatened legal actions  contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters  including laws and regulations relating to the environment  certain of which are discussed in note to the financial statements 
the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could  individually or in the aggregate  be material to the u

outlook for looking ahead  a loss from operations and a net loss are expected for the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  pension and other benefit costs will increase by approximately million and natural gas costs will be substantially higher 
although the fourth quarter included approximately million for blast furnace outages  the first quarter will have normal negative seasonal effects related to iron ore and transportation operations 
shipments for the flat rolled segment in the first quarter are expected to be in line with fourth quarter levels  however  product mix is expected to be less favorable as a result of planned slab sales and natural gas costs will be substantially higher 
for full year  flat rolled shipments are expected to approximate million net tons 
for the tubular segment  first quarter shipments are projected to be moderately higher than in the fourth quarter  and the average realized price is expected to be lower than in the fourth quarter 
shipments for full year are expected to be approximately million net tons  as higher energy prices should spur a recovery in north american drilling activity in the second half of ussk s first quarter shipments are expected to increase slightly from the fourth quarter  and shipments for the full year are projected to be approximately million net tons 
ussk s average realized price in the first quarter should improve from the fourth quarter due primarily to a january   price increase of euros per metric ton for all flat rolled products 
a price increase of at least per net ton has been announced for new oil country tubular goods orders for shipment after march  in addition  a price increase of per ton was announced for new domestic sheet orders for shipment march  and later 
also  ussk announced a minimum price increase of euros per metric ton for all shipments april  and later 
beginning in march and continuing throughout the year  ussk entered into various commercial arrangements with sartid  an integrated steel company with facilities located in smederevo and sabac in the republic of serbia 
tolling agreements provide for the conversion of cold rolled full hard into tin coated products  and raw materials into hot rolled bands and other finished products 
ussk retains ownership of these materials and markets all of the finished products 
a facility management agreement requires ussk to provide management oversight of sartid s tin processing facilities in sabac 
on july   sartid was placed into bankruptcy and shortly thereafter the bankruptcy administrator affirmed ussk s agreements with sartid 
at the request of the bankruptcy administrator  a commercial and technical support agreement was entered into on november   between ussk and the bankruptcy administrator  under which ussk has been retained to provide commercial  technical and financial support as necessary to assist the bankruptcy administrator in the operation of the smederevo facility 
in addition  u 
s 
steel continues to explore possibilities for involvement in the restructuring of sartid 
sartid s steel production has averaged  tons per year during the past two years  which is substantially below design capacity due to sartid s financial difficulties 
u 
s 
steel believes that with needed rehabilitation and investments  sartid s long term raw steelmaking capability could be increased to slightly more than million tons per year 
sartid primarily produces sheet products and its tinning facility has an annual capability of  tons 
on april   u

steel announced that it had signed a letter of intent to sell all of the coal and related assets associated with u 
s 
steel mining company s west virginia and alabama mines 
u 
s 
steel and the purchaser continue discussions 
u 
s 
steel anticipates that the sale will generate proceeds of approximately million and will result in a pre tax gain  excluding the recognition of the present value of obligations related to a multiemployer health care benefit plan created by the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the recognition of these obligations  which were broadly estimated to be million at december   will be required when u 
s 
steel exits the coal mining business and would result in an extraordinary loss of approximately million on an after tax basis 
on october   u

steel announced that it had signed a letter of intent to sell its raw materials and transportation businesses to an entity to be formed by affiliates of apollo management  lp on february   u 
s 
steel announced that it would suspend taking further actions relative to the sale of steel related assets with uswa representation  including the previously announced letter of intent to sell its raw materials and transportation units  pending labor negotiations with the uswa that are described below 
on january   u 
s 
steel announced that it had signed an asset purchase agreement apa with national to acquire substantially all of national s steelmaking and finishing assets for approximately million  which includes the assumption of liabilities of approximately million 
management believes that the acquisition of national would significantly increase u 
s 
steel s value added production capabilities and enhance u 
s 
steel s ability to serve the needs of north american customers in the automotive  container  appliance and construction industries 
the closing of the agreement with national was contingent on  among other things  the approval of the bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois  eastern division  and the execution and ratification of a new labor agreement with the uswa with respect to the steelworkers at the national facilities to be acquired 
on january   national announced that it had signed an agreement with another party  under which national would sell substantially all of its assets  including its pellet making facility  for  million  consisting of cash and the assumption of approximately million of liabilities 
the closing of the agreement between national and the other party is contingent on  among other things  the approval of the bankruptcy court and the execution and ratification of a new labor agreement with the uswa with respect to the steelworkers at the national facilities to be acquired 
the us bankruptcy court in chicago established an auction period for national steel s assets that began on february   and will end on april  on february   u 
s 
steel announced that it would immediately begin bargaining with the uswa to reach a new  progressive labor contract covering facilities now owned by bankrupt national as well as the uswa represented plants of u 
s 
steel 
u 
s 
steel remains interested in acquiring the assets of national if it is able to reach a new labor agreement with the uswa for the steelworkers at the national facilities and acquire the assets at a price that it views to be appropriate in light of conditions in the steel and financial markets at the time of the auction 
u 
s 
steel is in discussions with the uswa regarding such a labor agreement  as well as other matters  including our mutual interest in encouraging consolidation in the north american integrated steel industry 
u

steel submitted an indicative  non binding proposal to the government of poland for the purchase of polskie huty stali sa phs  the government owned steel company 
in accordance with its confidentiality agreement with the polish government  u 
s 
steel did not disclose the terms of its offer 
on february   u 
s 
steel was advised that it had been admitted to the next round of the privatization process 
the polish government has indicated its desire to complete the privatization by september  earlier this year four of poland s steel mills  including the two largest integrated facilities  were consolidated under phs  which currently has annual raw steel production capability of approximately million tons 
phs s steelmaking capability is expected to be reduced as a result of negotiations related to poland s accession into the eu 
phs primarily produces blooms  rails  wire and other long products  as well as plate and sheet products 
in line with u 
s 
steel s strategy to dispose of non strategic assets  management is also considering conveying certain timber properties to one or more employee benefit plans 
based on preliminary actuarial information for  the company expects annual net periodic pension costs to be million and annual retiree medical and life insurance costs to be million  excluding multiemployer plans 
since the expected return on assets component of net periodic cost is based upon a market related value that recognizes changes in fair value over three years  net periodic pension costs will also be progressively higher in and in  u 
s 
steel recorded a credit of million for pensions excluding settlement charges of million and a million expense for retiree medical and life insurance excluding multiemployer plans 
pension costs are expected to increase from primarily because of lower plan assets  average asset return assumptions that have been reduced from percent to percent  and a discount rate that has been reduced from percent to percent 
the anticipated increase in retiree medical and life insurance costs primarily reflects unfavorable health care claims cost experience in for union retirees  the use of the lower discount rate and higher assumed medical cost inflation 
for  a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits has been assumed 
this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of for and remain at that level thereafter 
as a result of the above factors and payments made in from benefit plans  u 
s 
steel s underfunded benefit obligations for retiree medical and life insurance increased from billion at year end to billion at year end also  the funded status of the projected pension benefit obligation declined from an overfunded position of billion at year end to an underfunded position of billion at year end this annual report contains forward looking statements with respect to market conditions  operating costs  shipments and prices  potential asset dispositions and potential acquisitions 
some factors  among others  that could affect market conditions  costs  shipments and prices for both domestic operations and ussk include product demand  prices and mix  global and company steel production levels  plant operating performance  the timing and completion of facility projects  natural gas prices and usage  changes in environmental  tax and other laws  the resumption of operation of steel facilities sold under the bankruptcy laws  and us and european economic performance and political developments 
domestic steel shipments and prices could be affected by import levels and actions taken by the us government and its agencies 
additional factors that may affect ussk s results are foreign currency fluctuations and political factors in europe that include  but are not limited to  taxation  nationalization  inflation  currency fluctuations  increased regulation  export quotas  tariffs  and other protectionist measures 
consummation of the asset dispositions will depend upon a number of factors including negotiation of definitive agreements  regulatory approvals  including department of labor approvals for the conveyances to the benefit plans  and the ability of the purchasers to arrange financing 
factors that may impact the occurrence and timing of the acquisition of national s steelmaking and finishing assets include the negotiation of a new labor agreement between u 
s 
steel and the united steelworkers of america covering employees of the national facilities  receipt of necessary clearances from the federal trade commission and the us department of justice under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvement act  approval by the surface transportation board under the surface transportation act for the acquisition of the delray connecting railroad company  the absence of any injunctions blocking the acquisition  and the results of the auction process contemplated in national s bankruptcy court filing

the adoption of these statements has not affected u 
s 
steel s critical accounting estimates 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
establishes a new accounting model for the recognition and measurement of retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that an asset retirement obligation should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method 
u 
s 
steel adopted this statement effective january  the transition adjustment of less than million  net of tax  resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities was issued in july sfas no 
addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities 
the scope of sfas no 
includes costs to terminate contracts that are not capital leases  costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees  and termination benefits provided to employees who are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
the provisions of this statement will be effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation elaborates on the disclosure to be made by a guarantor about obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that at the inception of a guarantee  the company must recognize liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements have been adopted for the annual financial statements see note to the financial statements

to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
the company has adopted the annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and will adopt the interim provisions effective with the first quarter of the company is not changing to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  therefore  the transition provisions are not applicable 
fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  was issued in january and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that do not have sufficient equity investment to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
this interpretation requires consolidation of a variable interest entity by the primary beneficiary and requires certain disclosures by the primary and other significant beneficiaries 
the provisions of this interpretation apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which a company obtains an interest after that date 
it applies for the interim period beginning after june   for variable interest entities in which a company holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the interpretation may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of first application or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
if it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity when this interpretation becomes effective  the company must make certain disclosures in all financial statements initially issued after january   regardless of the date on which the variable interest entity was created 
u 
s 
steel is in the process of assessing the appropriate application of this interpretation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments u 
s 
steel uses commodity based and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage its price risk 
management has authorized the use of futures  forwards  swaps and options to manage exposure to price fluctuations related to the purchase of natural gas  heating oil and nonferrous metals and also certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
derivative instruments used for trading and other activities are marked to market and the resulting gains or losses are recognized in the current period in income from operations 
while u 
s 
steel s risk management activities generally reduce market risk exposure due to unfavorable commodity price changes for raw material purchases and products sold  such activities can also encompass strategies that assume price risk 
management believes that the use of derivative instruments  along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls  does not expose u 
s 
steel to material risk 
the use of derivative instruments could materially affect u 
s 
steel s results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods  however  management believes that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on financial position or liquidity 
for a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments  see note to the financial statements 
commodity price risk and related risks in the normal course of its business  u 
s 
steel is exposed to market risk or price fluctuations related to the purchase  production or sale of steel products 
to a lesser extent  u 
s 
steel is exposed to price risk related to the purchase  production or sale of coal and coke and the purchase of natural gas  steel scrap  iron ore and pellets  and certain nonferrous metals used as raw materials 
u 
s 
steel s market risk strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for its products and services and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand  however  u 
s 
steel uses derivative commodity instruments primarily over the counter commodity swaps to manage exposure to fluctuations in the purchase price of natural gas and certain nonferrous metals 
the use of these instruments has not been significant in relation to u 
s 
steel s overall business activity 
sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on pre tax income of hypothetical and decreases in commodity prices for open derivative commodity instruments as of december   and december   are provided in the following table dollars in millions incremental decrease in pre tax income assuming a hypothetical price decrease of a commodity based derivative instruments zinc tin a with the adoption of sfas no 
 the definition of a derivative instrument has been expanded to include certain fixed price physical commodity contracts 
such instruments are included in the above table 
amounts reflect the estimated incremental effect on pre tax income of hypothetical and decreases in closing commodity prices for each open contract position at december   and december  management evaluates the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments on an ongoing basis and adjusts strategies to reflect anticipated market conditions  changes in risk profiles and overall business objectives 
changes to the portfolio subsequent to december   may cause future pre tax income effects to differ from those presented in the table 
u 
s 
steel recorded net pre tax losses on other than trading activity of million in  losses of million in and gains of million in these gains and losses were offset by changes in the realized prices of the underlying hedged commodities 
for additional quantitative information relating to derivative commodity instruments  see note to the financial statements 
interest rate risk u 
s 
steel is subject to the effects of interest rate fluctuations on certain of its non derivative financial instruments 
a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical decrease in year end and interest rates on the fair value of u 
s 
steel s non derivative financial instruments is provided in the following table dollars in millions incremental increase in fair value c incremental increase in fair value c as of december fair value b fair value b non derivative financial instruments a financial assets investments and long term receivables d financial liabilities long term debt e f   a fair values of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  notes payable  accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short term maturity of the instruments 
accordingly  these instruments are excluded from the table 
b see note to the financial statements for carrying value of instruments 
c reflects  by class of financial instrument  the estimated incremental effect of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates at december   and december   on the fair value of u 
s 
steel s non derivative financial instruments 
for financial liabilities  this assumes a decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of u 
s 
steel s long term debt at december   and december  d for additional information  see note to the financial statements 
e includes amounts due within one year 
f fair value was based on market prices where available  or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities 
for additional information  see note to the financial statements 
at december   u 
s 
steel s portfolio of long term debt was comprised primarily of fixed rate instruments 
therefore  the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations 
this sensitivity is illustrated by the million increase in the fair value of long term debt assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rates 
however  u 
s 
steel s sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of its debt portfolio would unfavorably affect u 
s 
steel s results and cash flows only to the extent that u 
s 
steel elected to repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of its fixed rate debt portfolio at prices above carrying value 
foreign currency exchange rate risk u 
s 
steel  primarily through ussk  is subject to the risk of price fluctuations due to the effects of exchange rates on revenues and operating costs  firm commitments for capital expenditures and existing assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than us dollars  in particular the euro and slovak koruna 
u 
s 
steel has not generally used derivative instruments to manage this risk 
however  u 
s 
steel has made limited use of forward currency contracts to manage exposure to certain currency price fluctuations 
at december   u 
s 
steel had open euro forward sale contracts for both us dollar total notional value of approximately million and slovak koruna total notional value of approximately million 
a increase in the december  euro forward rates would result in an additional million charge to income 
equity price risk on october   u 
s 
steel sold its investment in vsz 
prior to that time  u 
s 
steel was subject to equity price risk and market liquidity risk related to that investment 
safe harbor u 
s 
steel s quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward looking statements with respect to management s opinion about risks associated with u 
s 
steel s use of derivative instruments 
these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for steel products and certain raw materials 
to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future outcomes with respect to u 
s 
steel s hedging programs may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements
