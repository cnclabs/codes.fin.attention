item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the notes thereto  and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
dollars are in thousands  except per share and per unit amounts 
this form k contains forward looking statements with respect to the operation of certain of our properties 
we believe the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements made in this document are based on reasonable assumptions 
certain factors could occur that might cause actual results to vary 
these include our success or failure in implementing our business strategy  economic conditions generally and in the commercial real estate and finance markets specifically  our cost of capital  which depends in part on our asset quality  our relationships with lenders and other capital providers  our business prospects and outlook and general market conditions  and changes in governmental regulations  tax rates and similar matters  and other factors discussed elsewhere in this form k report filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the 
table of contents forward looking statements are identified by terminology such as may  will  should  believe  expect  estimate  anticipate  continue  predict or similar terms 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
it is our opinion that we fully disclose our significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
consistent with our disclosure policies we include the following discussion related to what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgment reserve for bad debts we provide for bad debt expense based upon the reserve method of accounting 
we continuously monitor the collectibility of our accounts receivable billed  unbilled and straight line from specific tenants  analyze historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in tenant payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
when tenants are in bankruptcy  we make estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims 
the ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year 
management believes the allowance is adequate to absorb currently estimated bad debts 
however  if we experience bad debts in excess of the reserves we have established  our operating income would be reduced 
kmart corporation filed for chapter bankruptcy protection during january kmart is our second largest tenant based on the percentage of our total annualized base rent and leases seven locations with a total annualized base rent at december  of approximately million 
on march   kmart announced its intention to close stores  including three stores leased from us 
on june   we entered into a termination agreement for one of the locations for redevelopment purposes 
designation rights for the other two locations were purchased by a third party 
of those two  one has been assumed and assigned to burlington coat factory without impact to monetary lease obligations and the other will expire on its own terms in april on january   kmart announced its intention to close an additional stores  including one store leased from us at our tel twelve shopping center 
kmart will continue to be lease obligated for this location unless kmart rejects the lease as part of its bankruptcy proceedings 
if the tel twelve lease is rejected  the collectibility of the straight line rent receivable in the amount of million is unlikely  and could result in an adverse effect on future results of operations 
bad debt expense amounted to   and  for the three years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue recognition shopping center space is generally leased to retail tenants under leases which are accounted for as operating leases 
we recognize minimum rents on the straight line method over the terms of the leases  as required under statement of financial accounting standard no 
certain of the leases also provide for additional revenue based on contingent percentage income which is recorded on an accrual basis once the specified target that triggers this type of income is achieved 
the leases also typically provide for tenant recoveries of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other operating expenses 
these recoveries are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable costs are incurred 
straight line rental income was greater than the current amount required to be paid by our tenants by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accounts receivable include unbilled straight line rent receivables of million at december  and million at december  straight line rent receivable at december   includes approximately million due from kmart corporation 
real estate we record real estate assets at the lower of cost or fair value if impaired 
costs incurred for the acquisition  development and construction of properties are capitalized 
for redevelopment of an existing operating property  the undepreciated net book value plus the cost for the construction including 
table of contents demolition costs incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent such costs do not exceed the estimated fair value when complete 
to the extent such costs exceed the estimated fair value of such property  the excess would be charged to expense 
we evaluate the recoverability of our investment in real estate whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired 
our assessment of recoverability of our real estate assets includes  but is not limited to recent operating results  expected net operating cash flow and our plans for future operations 
for the years ended  december   and  none of our assets was considered impaired 
in we substantially completed the first phase redevelopment of our tel twelve shopping center from an enclosed regional mall to an open air center for a total cost of approximately million in connection with the redevelopment  we demolished approximately of the gross leasable area  square feet of the shopping center 
an expanded  square foot dsw shoe warehouse and two  square foot multi tenant retail outlot buildings were completed and opened during lowe s home improvement opened a  square foot building in february other assets other assets consist primarily of prepaid expenses  proposed development and acquisition costs  and financing and leasing costs which are amortized using the straight line method over the terms of the respective agreements 
proposed development and acquisition costs amounted to million at december  and million at december  we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of other assets 
these assessments have a direct impact on our consolidated financial statements if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable 
off balance sheet arrangements we have five off balance sheet investments in which we have a or less ownership interest 
we provide leasing  development and property management services to the joint ventures 
these investments are accounted for under the equity method 
in our judgment  we do not have the level of control of these joint ventures to include the entities as consolidated subsidiaries 
result of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues total revenue increased or million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  of the million increase  million was the result of increased minimum rents

table of contents minimum rents increased  or million for the year ended december  increase decrease amount millions percentage same center acquisitions dispositions the decrease in same center minimum rents is principally attributable to the redevelopment during of our tel twelve shopping center from an enclosed regional mall to an open air center and the redevelopment of the shoppes of lakeland 
in addition  our occupancy rate for our centers decreased to at december  from at december  the decrease in the occupancy rate is attributable to the increase in the number of retail companies filing for bankruptcy protection during and as a result of these bankruptcies  some national retail tenants closed stores at several of our locations 
we have recently gained control of a few of these locations and we are currently negotiating with potential tenants to lease the space 
recoveries from tenants increased  or million for the year ended december  the increase in recoveries from tenants at same centers is primarily the result of general increases in real estate tax recoveries during the overall recovery ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the following two tables include recovery revenue and related expenses that comprise the recovery ratio

the change in the law has been vigorously challenged in the courts by a number of taxpayers 
in january  we were informed that the michigan supreme court elected not to review the appellate courts decision that overturned a favorable lower court ruling in favor of a taxpayer 
since we previously paid the additional tax for the above mentioned years and filed a protective claim requesting a refund  we recorded a receivable from the state of michigan 
as a result of the michigan supreme court s decision not to hear the case  we reversed the receivable and recognized an expense in interest expense increased  or  for the year ended december  the summary below identifies the increase by its various components dollars in thousands

various executive officers trustees of the company are partners in that partnership 
the property was offered for sale  utilizing the services of a national real estate brokerage firm  and we accepted the highest offer from an unrelated party 
subsequently the buyer cancelled the agreement 
pontiac mall limited partnership presented a comparable offer  which resulted in more favorable economic benefits to us 
the sale of the property was entered into upon the unanimous approval of the independent members of our board of trustees 
since january   ramco gershenson  inc ramco  our management company providing property management services to us and to other entities  has been consolidated in our financial statements 
as of january   ramco elected to be a taxable real estate investment trust subsidiary for federal income tax purposes 
in conjunction with the tax election  we entered into an option agreement to purchase the remaining voting common stock of ramco  which we exercised 
in prior years this entity was accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
fees and management income earned by ramco contributed million to the increase in revenue for the year ended december  for the year ended december   percentage rents decreased  to million  as compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease is the result of tenant changes associated with redevelopment projects and our efforts to convert percentage rent to higher minimum rent when renewing leases 

table of contents total expenses for the year ended december  increased  or million to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a million increase in general and administrative expenses 
the increase was offset by a  decrease in total recoverable expenses  including real estate taxes and a million decrease in interest expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  or million to million in the increase is primarily due to the redevelopment projects completed during and amortization of leasing commissions and financing costs

liquidity and capital resources our capital structure at december   includes property specific mortgages  an unsecured revolving credit facility loan  the secured revolving credit facility  our series b preferred shares  our common shares and a minority interest in the operating partnership 
the principal uses of our liquidity and capital resources are for acquisitions  development  redevelopment  including expansion and renovation programs and debt repayment  as well as dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements 
we anticipate that cash on hand  borrowings under our existing credit facility  as well as other debt and equity alternatives  will provide the necessary capital to achieve continued growth 
the following is a summary of our cash flow activities dollars in thousands year ended december  cash flow provided by operating activities cash flow provided by used in investing activities cash flow provided by used in financing activities 
table of contents to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  we are required to distribute to our shareholders at least of our real estate investment trust taxable income as defined in the code 
we satisfied the reit requirement with declared common and preferred share dividends of million in  million in and million in the following are our contractual cash obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating lease unconditional construction cost obligations total contractual cash obligations at december   our market capitalization amounted to million

our debt to total market capitalization was at december   as compared to at december  our outstanding debt at december   had a weighted average interest rate of  and consisted of million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt 
effective december  we renewed our secured revolving credit facility  increasing the maximum available borrowings from million to million  and we extended the maturity due date to december at our option  we can increase the available amount of borrowings by million to million 
the interest rate is at libor plus a margin of to basis points  depending on certain of our leverage ratios 
the credit facility is secured by mortgages on various properties and contains financial covenants relating to liabilities to assets ratios  minimum operating coverage ratios and a minimum equity value 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenant terms 
we also amended our unsecured loan in december we increased our ability to borrow up to million  due december at our option  we can increase the available amount of the unsecured revolving credit facility borrowings by million to million 
the interest rate is at libor plus a margin of to basis points  depending on certain of our leverage ratios 
outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit facility amounted to million at december  under terms of various debt agreements  we are required to maintain interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rate on our floating rate debt 
we have six interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million at december  based on rates in effect at december   the agreements provide for fixed rates ranging from to at libor plus basis points and expire at various dates through march we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by the counter party to the interest rate swap agreements  however we do not anticipate non performance by the counter party 
after taking into account the impact of converting our variable rate debt into fixed rate debt by use of the interest rate swap agreements  at december   our variable rate debt accounted for approximately million of outstanding debt with a weighted average interest rate of 
variable rate debt accounted for approximately of our total debt and of our total market capitalization 
the properties in which ramco gershenson properties  lp the operating partnership  owns an interest and which we account for using the equity method of accounting are subject to non recourse mortgage indebtedness 
at december   the pro rata share of non recourse mortgage debt of these properties held by unconsolidated entities was million with a weighted average interest rate of 

table of contents the mortgage loans other than our secured revolving credit facility encumbering our properties  including properties held by our unconsolidated joint ventures  are generally non recourse  subject to certain exceptions for which we would be liable for any resulting losses incurred by the lender 
these exceptions vary from loan to loan but generally include fraud or a material misrepresentation  misstatement or omission by the borrower  intentional or grossly negligent conduct by the borrower that harms the property or results in a loss to the lender  filing of bankruptcy petition by the borrower  either directly or indirectly  and certain environmental liabilities 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain of such events  such as fraud or filing of a bankruptcy petition by the borrower  we would be liable for the entire outstanding balance of the loan  all interest accrued thereon and certain other costs  penalties and expenses 
at december   our unconsolidated joint venture entities had million of debt outstanding  of which million was our proportionate share 
on april   we issued million common shares of beneficial interest in a public offering 
on may   we issued an additional  common shares upon the exercise by the underwriter of their over allotment option 
we received total net proceeds of million  based on an offering price of per share 
the net proceeds from the offering were used to redeem million of our series a preferred shares  purchase the equity interest of our joint venture partner in rpt invest  llc and pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
as a result of this offering  the remaining  of our series a preferred shares automatically converted into  common shares on april  on november   we issued million shares of series b cumulative redeemable preferred shares 
we received total net proceeds of million based on an offering price of per share 
the net proceeds from this offering were used to purchase the equity interest of our joint venture partners in rossford development llc and in east town plaza shopping center 
a portion of the proceeds from this offering were used to purchase the fee interest in a parcel of property adjacent to our naples  florida shopping center 
at december   the minority interest in the operating partnership represented a ownership in the operating partnership which may  under certain conditions  be exchanged for  common shares 
as of december   operating partnership units op units issued were exchangeable for our common shares on a one for one basis 
we  as sole general partner of the operating partnership  have the option  but not the obligation  to settle exchanged op units in cash based on the current trading price of our common shares 
assuming the exchange of all limited partnership interests in the operating partnership  there would have been  of our common shares outstanding at december   with a market value of approximately million at december  based on the closing price of per share on december  
we have historically funded  and may continue to fund  some of our acquisition and development activities by entering into joint venture transactions with third parties in which we own or less of the joint venture entity 
as part of our business plan to improve our capital structure and reduce debt  we will continue to pursue the strategy of selling fully valued properties and to dispose of shopping centers that no longer meet the criteria established for our portfolio 
our ability to obtain acceptable selling prices and satisfactory terms will impact the timing of future sales 
net proceeds from the sale of properties are expected to reduce outstanding debt 
we anticipate that the combination of the availability under the secured revolving credit facility  the unsecured revolving credit facility  possible equity offerings  the sale of existing properties  and potential new debt will satisfy our expected working capital requirements through at least the next months 
we anticipate adequate liquidity for the foreseeable future to fund future developments  expansions  repositionings  and to continue currently planned capital programs  and to make distributions to our shareholders in accordance with the code s requirements applicable to reits 
although we believe that the combination of factors discussed above will provide sufficient liquidity  no such assurance can be given 

table of contents economic conditions the retail industry has experienced some financial difficulties during the past few years and certain local  regional and national retailers have filed for protection under bankruptcy laws 
if this trend should continue  our future earnings performance could be negatively impacted 
sensitivity analysis we are exposured to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt obligations 
we are not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk  or other material market rate or price risks 
based on our debt and interest rates and the interest rate swap agreements in effect at december   a basis point change in interest rates would affect our earnings and cash flows by approximately  under terms of various debt agreements  we are required to maintain interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rate on our floating rate debt 
we have six interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million at december  based on rates in effect at december   the agreements provide for fixed rates ranging from to at libor plus basis points and expire at various dates through march we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by the counter party to the interest rate swap agreements  however we do not anticipate non performance by the counter party 
risks related to our business adverse market conditions and tenant bankruptcies the economic performance and value of our real estate assets are subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate  including risks related to adverse changes in national  regional and local economic and market conditions 
our current properties are located in states in the midwestern  southeastern and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
the economic condition of each of our markets may be dependent on one or more industries 
an economic downturn in one of these industries may result in a business downturn for our tenants  and as a result  these tenants may fail to make rental payments  decline to extend leases upon expiration  delay lease commencements or declare bankruptcy 
any tenant bankruptcies  leasing delays  or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant s lease  causing material losses to us and adversely impacting our operating results 
if our properties do not generate sufficient income to meet our operating expenses  including future debt service  our income and results of operations would be adversely affected 
kmart corporation filed for chapter bankruptcy protection during january kmart is our second largest tenant based on the percentage of our total annualized base rent and leases seven locations with a total annualized base rent at december  of approximately million 
on march   kmart announced its intention to close stores  including three stores leased from us 
on june   we entered into a termination agreement for one of the locations for redevelopment purposes 
designation rights for the other two locations were purchased by a third party 
of those two  one has been assumed and assigned to burlington coat factory without impact of monetary lease obligations and the other will expire on its own terms in april on january   kmart announced its intention to close an additional stores  including one store leased from us at our tel twelve shopping center 
kmart will continue to be lease obligated for this location unless kmart rejects the lease as part of its bankruptcy proceedings 
if the tel twelve lease is rejected  the collectibility of straight line rent receivable in the amount of million is unlikely  and could result in an adverse effect on future results of operations 
any bankruptcy filings by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre bankruptcy debts from that tenant  the lease guarantor or their property  unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court 
a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums 
if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy  all pre bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full 
however  if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy  we would have only a 
table of contents general unsecured claim for damages 
any unsecured claim we hold may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims 
it is possible that we may recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold  if at all  which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
several of our tenants represent a significant portion of our leasing revenues 
as of december   we received of our annualized rent from wal mart stores  inc and from kmart corporation 
six other tenants each represented at least of our total annualized base rent 
the concentration in our leasing revenue from a small number of tenants creates the risk that  should these tenants experience financial difficulties  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we are involved in various tax disputes with the internal revenue service and may not be able to resolve these disputes on satisfactory terms 
we are involved in a dispute with the irs that relates to its examination of our taxable years ended december   through during the third quarter of  we held more than of the value of our total assets in short term treasury bill reverse repurchase agreements  which could be viewed as non qualifying assets for purposes of determining whether we qualify to be taxed as a reit 
we requested that the irs enter into a closing agreement with us that our ownership of the short term treasury bill reverse repurchase agreements would not adversely affect our status as a reit 
the irs deferred any action relating to this issue pending the further examination of our taxable years ended december  through as discussed below  the field examination has since been completed and the irs has proposed to disqualify us as a reit for our taxable year ended december   based on our ownership of the short term treasury bill reverse repurchase agreements 
in connection with the incorporation and distribution of all of the shares of atlantic realty trust in may  we entered into a tax agreement with atlantic under which atlantic assumed all tax liability arising out of the irs then ongoing examination  excluding any tax liability relating to any actions or events occurring  or any tax return position taken  after may   but including liabilities for interest  penalties  additions to tax and costs relating to covered taxes 
in addition  the tax agreement provides that  to the extent any of our taxes which atlantic is obligated to pay under the tax agreement can be avoided through the declaration of a deficiency dividend that is  our declaration and payment of a distribution that is permitted to relate back to the year for which the irs determines a deficiency in order to satisfy the requirement for reit qualification that we distribute a certain minimum percentage of our reit taxable income for such year  we will make  and atlantic will reimburse us for the amount of  such deficiency dividend 
in addition to examining our taxable years ended december  through  the irs examined our taxable year ended december  based on these examinations  the irs has not only proposed to disqualify us as a reit for our taxable year ended december   based on our ownership of the short term treasury bill reverse repurchase agreements  as noted above  but has also proposed to adjust increase our reit taxable income for the taxable years ended december     and if sustained  the adjustments proposed by the irs to our reit taxable income would  in and of themselves  disqualify us as a reit for at least some of these years unless we were to pay a deficiency dividend for each of the taxable years for which we would otherwise be disqualified as a reit as a result of having failed to distribute a sufficient amount of our taxable income 
we are continuing to dispute these issues with the irs through an administrative appeals procedure 
in addition  the irs is currently conducting an examination of our taxable years ended december  and  and of our operating partnership for the taxable years ended december   and based on the second of two examination reports issued by the irs  we could be liable for up to million in combined taxes  penalties and interest through march  however  this examination report acknowledges as does the initial examination report that we can avoid disqualification as a reit for certain of our examined tax years if we distribute a deficiency dividend to our shareholders 
the distribution of a deficiency dividend would be deductible by us  thereby reducing our liability for federal income tax 
based on the second examination report  the proposed adjustments to our reit taxable income would require us 
table of contents to pay a deficiency dividend to our current shareholders resulting in combined taxes  penalties  interest and deficiency dividends of approximately million as of march  if the irs successfully challenges our status as a reit for any taxable year  we will be able to re elect reit status commencing with the fifth succeeding taxable year or possibly an earlier taxable year if we meet certain relief provisions of the internal revenue code 
in the notes to the consolidated financial statements made part of atlantic s quarterly report on form q filed with the securities and exchange commission for the quarter ended september   atlantic has disclosed its liability for the tax deficiencies and interest and penalties on the tax deficiencies proposed to be assessed against us by the irs for the taxable years ended december   through  as reflected in each of the two examination reports issued by the irs 
we believe  but can provide no assurance  that atlantic currently has sufficient assets to pay such tax deficiencies  interest and penalties 
according to the quarterly report on form q filed by atlantic for its quarter ended september   atlantic had net assets on september   of approximately million as determined pursuant to the liquidation basis of accounting 
if the amount of tax  interest and penalties assessed against us ultimately exceeds the amounts proposed in each of the examination reports  however  because interest continues to accrue on the proposed tax deficiencies  or if additional tax deficiencies are proposed or for any other reason  then atlantic may not have sufficient assets to reimburse us for all amounts we must pay to the irs  and we would be required to pay the difference out of our own funds 
accordingly  the ultimate resolution of any controversy over tax liabilities covered by the above described tax agreement may have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows  including if we are required to distribute deficiency dividends to our shareholders and or pay additional taxes  interest and penalties to the irs in amounts that exceed the value of atlantic s net assets 
moreover  the irs may assess us with taxes that atlantic is not required under the above described tax agreement to pay  such as taxes arising from the recently commenced examination of us for the taxable years ended december   and  and of our operating partnership for the taxable years ended december   and there can be no assurance  therefore  that the irs will not assess us with substantial taxes  interest and penalties which atlantic cannot  is not required to  or otherwise does not pay 
our failure to qualify as a reit would result in higher taxes and reduced cash available for our shareholders 
we believe that we currently operate in a manner so as to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
if  however  we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates  and distributions to shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income 
any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders  which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of  and trading prices for  our shares 
unless entitled to relief under certain internal revenue code provisions  we also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a reit 
ability to successfully identify or complete suitable acquisitions and new developments 
integral to our business strategy is our ability to continue to acquire and develop properties 
we also may not be successful in identifying suitable real estate properties that meet our acquisition criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms 
we may not be successful in identifying suitable areas for new development  negotiating for the acquisition of the land  obtaining required permits and authorizations  completing developments in accordance with our budgets and on a timely basis or leasing any newly developed space 
if we fail to identify or complete suitable acquisitions or developments within our budget  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and our growth could slow  which in turn could adversely impact our share price 

table of contents our redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
a key component of our business strategy is exploring redevelopment opportunities at existing properties within our portfolio and in connection with property acquisitions 
to the extent that we engage in these redevelopment activities  they will be subject to the risks normally associated with these projects  including  among others  cost overruns and timing delays as a result of the lack of availability of materials and labor  weather conditions and other factors outside of our control 
any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these redevelopment projects and adversely impact our operating results 
funds from operations we generally consider funds from operations  also known as ffo  an appropriate supplemental measure of our financial performance because it is predicated on cash flow analyses 
we have adopted the most recent national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo  which was amended april under the nareit definition  ffo represents income before minority interest  excluding extraordinary items  as defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  gains on sales of depreciable property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
our computation of ffo may  however  differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other real estate companies  and therefore  may not be comparable to these other real estate companies 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or our ability to pay distributions 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows from operating activities as measure of liquidity or our ability to pay distributions

capital expenditures during  we spent approximately  on revenue generating capital expenditures including tenant allowances  leasing commissions paid to third party brokers  legal costs relative to lease documents  and capitalized leasing and construction costs 
these types of costs generate a return through rents from tenants over the term of their leases 
revenue enhancing capital expenditures  including expansions  renovations and repositionings were approximately  revenue neutral capital expenditures  such as roof and parking lot repairs which are anticipated to be recovered from tenants  amounted to approximately inflation substantially all of our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants gross sales  which usually increase as prices rise  and or  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the term of the leases

the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  but it may have an impact in future years 
the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas in june this statement changes the accounting for the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination from an amortization method to an impairment only method

this statement requires the use of one of two present value techniques to measure the fair value of an asset

the adoption of sfas resulted in reporting the operating results of a shopping center and the gain on sale of a shopping center in discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated statements of income 
using our best estimates based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  we review for impairment such long lives assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable and no material impairment occurred since we adopted this pronouncement 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
rescission of fasb statement no

sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas which amends fasb no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement provided alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation

we elected not to change our 
table of contents method of accounting for stock based compensation from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method

in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  interpretation 
this interpretation expands the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for its fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
interpretation is effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not expect the provisions of interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and results of operations of a vie need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate the entity if the company s interest in the vie is such that the company will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  if they occur 
fin also requires additional disclosure by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
the disclosure provisions of this interpretation become effective upon issuance 
the consolidated requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and in the fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  to existing variable interest entities 
we are currently in the process of evaluating all of our joint venture relationships which are described in note in order to determine whether the entities are variable interest entities and whether we are considered to be the primary beneficiary or whether we hold a significant variable interest
