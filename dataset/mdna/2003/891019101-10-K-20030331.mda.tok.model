item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the discussion below contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in this form k 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed above under the captions forward looking statements and item business risk factors 
overview we provide subsea construction services in connection with the in field development of offshore oil and natural gas reservoirs 
we are a leading service provider in our market niche of installing and maintaining small diameter flowlines and related infrastructure on the shelf 
over the last few years  we have expanded our operations  fleet capabilities and management expertise to enable us to provide deeper water services analogous to the services we provide on the shelf 
since  we have increased the size of our total fleet from three to eleven construction and service vessels 
in  we added two diving support vessels and one supply diving support vessel 
in  we added one fully redundant dynamically positioned  or dp  pipelay bury barge the midnight eagle and one dp subsea construction vessel the midnight arrow 
in june  we purchased a pipelay bury barge  the midnight rider  which increased our capabilities on the shelf and was placed into service in late in  we completed the acquisition of a foot vessel from smit international 
this vessel will be converted to a dp offshore construction vessel with our patent pending pipelay system and renamed the midnight express 
in december  we committed to purchase a cable lay vessel  renamed the midnight wrangler  for the purpose of deepwater pipelay and subsea construction 
we took possession of this vessel in march this vessel will enter our active fleet during the second quarter of after various modifications to the vessel are made 
we are actively seeking opportunities to expand our fleet either through construction or acquisition of vessels 
in addition  we purchased the midnight gator  a supply barge  in september we are currently converting this piece of equipment into a sand dredge and it will become available for use in the second quarter of for the purpose of jetting trenches for pipe burial in shallow waters 
in november  we signed a contract to provide pipeline installation support in the boston  massachusetts harbor 
the contract commenced in the fourth quarter of and should last for a period of five to six months from the date of commencement 
the contract calls for the midnight rider to work outside of gulf of mexico waters for the duration of the contract 
the contract provides for the mobilization and demobilization of the vessel in addition to the pipelay and burial work to be completed by the midnight rider 
factors affecting results of operations the demand for subsea construction services primarily depends on the prices of oil and natural gas 
these prices reflect the general condition of the industry and influence the willingness of our customers to spend capital to develop oil and natural gas reservoirs 
we are unable to predict future oil and natural gas prices or the level of offshore construction activity related to the industry 
in addition to the prices of oil and natural gas  we use the following leading indicators  among others  to forecast the demand for our services o the offshore mobile and jack up rig counts  o forecasts of capital expenditures by major and independent oil and natural gas companies  and o recent lease sale activity levels 
even when demand for subsea construction services is strong  several factors may affect our profitability  including the following o competition  o equipment and labor productivity  o weather conditions  o contract estimating uncertainties  o global economic and political circumstances  and o other risks inherent in marine construction 
although greatly influenced by overall market conditions  our fleet wide utilization is generally lower during the first half of the year because of winter weather conditions in the gulf of mexico 
accordingly  we endeavor to schedule our drydock inspections and routine and preventative maintenance during this period 
additionally  during the first quarter  a substantial number of our customers finalize capital budgets and solicit bids for construction projects 
for this reason  individual quarterly interim results are not necessarily indicative of the expected results for any given year 
in the life of an offshore field  capital is allocated to the development of a well following a commercial discovery 
the time that elapses between a successfully drilled well and the development phase  in which we participate  varies depending on the water depth of the field 
on the shelf  demand for our services generally follows drilling activities by three to twelve months 
we have noticed that demand for pipeline installation for deepwater projects exceeding  feet of water depth generally follows drilling activities by eighteen months to three years 
these deepwater installations typically require much more engineering design work than do shelf installations 
outlook we experienced positive earnings in and expect a similar result in  although we expect these earnings to be minimal 
we believe the first half of will be a period of minimal activity with a possibility for an increase in activity during the second half of the year 
despite the relatively high commodity prices of both oil and natural gas  the exploration and production spending budgets of the oil and natural gas companies remained relatively flat and are expected to maintain that pattern in the near term due to the many uncertainties regarding the current state of the world s economies and current war in iraq 
we believe that our future financial and operating results will continue to be highly dependent on overall market conditions in the oil and natural gas industry 
we believe that the shelf will benefit from recently passed royalty relief regulations  which provide certain benefits to companies performing deep drilling on the shelf 
we anticipate that this benefit may entice certain independent oil and natural gas operators to increase their drilling for natural gas on the shelf 
in addition  we anticipate that the gulf of mexico offshore construction industry will benefit from improved long term industry fundamentals 
we believe that a combination of factors  such as the expected increase in worldwide energy demand  decreased levels of natural gas storage  positive shelf and deepwater forecasts for capital expenditures in and our strong market presence  positions us well for the future 
the extensive transportation infrastructure present on the shelf facilitates the development of incremental fields that can be tied into existing trunklines originally constructed to service fields that are now in the process of decline  which favors our shelf market niche strategy 
the additions to our active fleet of the midnight wrangler in and the midnight express in early also positions us to take on the challenges and opportunities of the deepwater market in the near future 
natural gas consumption in the united states is expected to continue to increase over the next decade  as it did during  leading to a further depletion of levels of natural gas storage 
a large portion of this continued expansion is expected to come from the growth in electric power requirements and overall population growth 
environmental and economic considerations dictate that a large percentage of this increased electric power will come from newly constructed gas fired power generation facilities 
oil consumption should also remain relatively stable in the near term 
management believes that significant new capital must be continually invested in field exploration and development in order to maintain  much less grow  existing oil and natural gas energy production levels to meet these growing demands 
these increased demands for natural gas and the dominant role of independent oil and natural gas operators on the shelf should allow the gulf of mexico to maintain and even increase its position as a major source of north american natural gas supplies for the intermediate term 
according to the mms  approximately of the natural gas production in the first nine months of in the gulf of mexico came from shallow water fields 
in addition  technological advances have enabled oil and natural gas companies to improve exploration success rates 
management believes that the higher demand  improved technologies  and higher natural gas prices will permit the exploration for and the development of additional marginal prospects  resulting in increased activity on the shelf where we already have a strong market position 
while the economic fundamentals of the shelf are positive  major oil and natural gas companies and large independent oil and natural gas operators are increasingly focusing their exploration and development efforts on frontier areas  particularly the deepwater regions of the gulf of mexico and the coasts of south america and west africa 
these regions offer greater oil and natural gas reserve and production growth potential relative to the existing shelf regions 
focusing on the gulf of mexico  deepwater production has been much more prolific and oil prone than on the shelf  as approximately of the oil production from the gulf of mexico was from deepwater fields during the first nine months of according to the mms the mms classifies deepwater as  feet deep and beyond 
these worldwide deepwater basins are one of the few non opec areas to have major reserve potential  with numerous individual discoveries expected to produce more than one billion barrels each 
there have already been several deepwater fields identified for development and various other projects are under contemplation 
the completion of these deepwater projects will require multi billion dollar expenditures and will result in additional wells  subsea trees  templates and manifolds  subsea control lines  flowlines  risers  and fixed and floating platforms 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase resulted from an overall increase in the number of revenue days worked by the fleet  as the capacity of the fleet was expanded during the midnight rider was in the fleet for all of  contributing revenue days  versus availability during only a portion of  when it contributed revenue days 
the midnight hunter was an active part of our fleet and added revenue days during the second half of the overall fleet wide improvement for the number of revenue days worked was  as the fleet worked  days in as compared to  days in the average vessel utilization of the fleet decreased slightly during to versus in in addition  average pricing realization levels revenues divided by revenue days for our services in were approximately higher than levels per revenue day worked 
gross profit 
gross profit defined as revenues less cost of sales was million of revenues for the year ended december   compared to million of revenues for the year ended december   a decrease of 
cost of sales consists of job related costs such as vessel wages  insurance and repairs and maintenance 
the decrease in the overall gross profit as a percentage of revenue was caused by an increase in job related insurance costs  higher offshore wages and benefits  increased fuel costs  and higher subcontract costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase primarily reflects a full year of depreciation on the midnight rider in  versus only a partial year of depreciation in in addition  depreciation on the equipment added to the midnight hunter commenced in the third quarter of  the depreciation on the midnight eagle increased due to the addition of equipment during  and there was an increase in depreciation related to computer equipment 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million of revenues for the year ended december  compared to million of revenues for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in as compared to was a result of higher consulting fees  investor relation costs and franchise taxes related to being a public entity for the entire year along with higher insurance premiums and wages 
other operating expense 
other operating expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million of other operating expense for the year ended december  the other operating expense in relates primarily to charges resulting from the write off of certain costs due to the termination of the midnight hunter charter agreement and the write off of certain financing costs related to the midnight express 
in addition  the other operating expense includes a million charge relating to an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the other operating expense in relates to the charge resulting from the write off of certain costs related to the midnight warrior project 
interest expense  net 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to net interest expense of million for the year ended december  we capitalized all of our interest costs totaling million  in relation to the construction of the midnight express 
the interest expense in was incurred before we retired all outstanding debt in june with the proceeds of our initial public offering 
in addition  the interest income on the remaining proceeds of our initial public offering totaled million 
income taxes 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million income tax provision at a effective tax rate 
in connection with our initial public offering  we became subject to corporate level taxation 
as such  we recorded a one time million tax charge based upon the cumulative book and tax basis differences at that time 
additionally  we recorded a million income tax provision  at a effective rate  on pretax earnings subsequent to our initial public offering 
if we had been subject to payment of income taxes for the entire period  we would have recorded an additional charge of million for the year ended december  extraordinary loss 
in june  we completed our initial public offering resulting in the retirement of all outstanding debt balances 
in connection with this extinguishment of debt  we recognized a million net of taxes of million charge on the early extinguishment of debt see note to the financial statements 
net income loss attributable to common stockholders 
net income to common stockholders for the year ended december  was million  compared with a net loss of million in  including a million charge for preferred dividends in comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase resulted from the generally stronger shelf natural gas market for the first half of and an increase in the number of revenue days worked 
the overall fleet wide improvement for the number of revenue days worked was as the fleet worked  days in as compared to  days in the average vessel utilization of the fleet remained steady at versus in in addition  average pricing levels revenues divided by revenue days for our services in were higher than levels 
gross profit 
gross profit was million of revenues for the year ended december   compared to million of revenues for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase resulted directly from the increase in revenues  with the gross profit as a percentage of revenues remaining steady 
cost of sales consists of job related costs such as vessel wages  insurance and repairs and maintenance 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase primarily reflects a partial year of depreciation in on the midnight rider and a full year of amortization on the drydocking of the midnight carrier  which occurred in late general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million of revenues for the year ended december   compared to million of revenues for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase was caused by the introduction of new costs as we went through our initial public offering and continued the expansion of our sales efforts and promotions 
other operating expense 
other operating expense was million for the year ended december   which equaled the million of other operating expense for the year ended december  the other operating expense in relates to the charge relating to the write off of certain costs related to the midnight warrior that could not be carried over to the conversion of the midnight express 
other operating expense for the year ended december  primarily related to severance costs associated with a former employee and the provision for doubtful trade receivables 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an decrease of 
this decrease was achieved because we retired all outstanding debt in june with the proceeds of our initial public offering 
in addition  the remaining proceeds of our initial public offering led to million in interest income 
income taxes 
in connection with our initial public offering  we became subject to corporate level taxation 
as such  we recorded a one time million tax charge based upon the cumulative book and tax basis differences at that time 
additionally  we recorded a million income tax provision  at a effective rate  on pretax earnings subsequent to our initial public offering 
if we had been subject to payment of income taxes for the entire periods  we would have recorded an additional charge of million for the year ended december   and a credit of million for the year ended december  extraordinary loss 
in june  we completed our initial public offering resulting in the retirement of all outstanding debt balances 
in connection with this extinguishment of debt  we recognized a million net of taxes of million charge on the early extinguishment of debt see note to the financial statements 
net loss attributable to common stockholders 
net loss to common stockholders for the year ended december   was million  compared with a net loss of million in  including a million and million charge for preferred dividends in and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources in june  we completed an initial public offering of million shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of million  net proceeds were million after underwriting commission and discounts and expenses the public offering 
we subsequently retired all debt  purchased the midnight rider  and initiated the detailed engineering for the construction of the midnight warrior discussed below 
we also used the proceeds from the public offering to purchase the midnight express and commence the conversion of the vessel during concurrent with the public offering  the predecessor company s million of preferred membership units were exchanged for  shares of our common stock 
in the year ended december   our operations used cash of million as compared to million of cash generated during the proceeds from the public offering and cash flow from operations funded the million and million used in investing activities related to the purchase of equipment in and  respectively 
cash flow provided by financing activities was million during as compared to million in the cash flows from financing consisted primarily of million of net proceeds against our receivable line of credit offset by million of treasury stock purchases 
the public offering in greatly affected the cash flow from financing activities in as described above and it also allowed us to retire all outstanding debt and repurchase million of treasury stock 
working capital decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  due primarily to the million we expended during related to the conversion of the midnight express  an increase in accounts payable trade and the million drawn against our receivable line of credit facility 
historically  our capital requirements have been primarily for the acquisition and improvement of our vessels and other related equipment 
we expect that as we enter into the deepwater market our capital requirements will continue to be primarily for the acquisition and improvement of our vessels 
capital expenditures totaled million for  million for and million for the capital expenditures in primarily relate to the deepwater expansion of our fleet funded with cash on hand 
in prior years  the capital expenditures represented the expansion of our fleet and were funded with cash flow from operations  additional indebtedness and  most recently  proceeds from the public offering 
we expect to fund our cash requirements for any future capital investments from cash on hand  cash flow from operations and by utilizing our bank and debt facilities 
we currently estimate capital expenditures for to be approximately million  primarily representing the construction of  and the equipment and support facilities associated with  the conversion of the midnight express 
included in this estimate are approximately million of improvements on the midnight wrangler and approximately million for routine capital and drydock inspections of our vessels to be incurred over this period 
not included in this figure is the purchase price of the midnight wrangler of million  which will be financed by the seller as discussed below 
in july  we entered into a million bank facility the bank facility with regions bank consisting of a million asset based five year revolving credit facility and a million accounts receivable based working capital facility 
the interest on the bank facility is the london interbank offered rate libor plus a range of to  depending upon the level of the consolidated leverage ratio as defined measured on a quarterly basis 
borrowings under the bank facility are secured by first preferred ship mortgage liens on a portion of our fleet and a pledge of our accounts receivable 
amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable based working capital facility may not exceed of eligible trade accounts receivable 
under the terms of the bank facility  we must maintain tangible net worth of at least million  a minimum debt service coverage ratio of at least to  a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than to and a consolidated current ratio of at least to we had borrowed million under the million accounts receivable based working capital facility as of december  in addition  we issued a million standby letter of credit as security for the charter payments due under the charter agreement for the midnight hunter against the million accounts receivable based working capital facility and a million standby letter of credit as security for payments related to a crane to be constructed as part of the midnight express conversion against the million asset based five year revolving credit facility 
in march  we received commitment letters for a month credit line to finance the conversion of the midnight express the finance facility  however  the financing has not yet been finalized as it is contingent upon the shipyard contract becoming effective 
the credit line will convert into a three year term loan facility upon completion of the conversion of the midnight express 
the finance facility commitment is equally provided by regions bank and edc million participation by each 
as part of the terms and conditions of the finance facility  regions bank will restructure the million asset based five year revolving credit facility discussed above and make this part of the finance facility 
we will continue to have available the million accounts receivable based working capital facility discussed above from regions bank 
in addition  the million standby letter of credit as security for payments related to a crane to be constructed as part of the midnight express conversion will be transferred to the finance facility 
the interest rate for the construction financing will be based upon our consolidated leverage ratio ranges from a libor spread of to based upon these levels 
we will provide collateral in the form of the midnight express as well as a first preferred ship mortgage on the midnight fox  midnight star  midnight dancer  midnight carrier  midnight brave and midnight rider 
we will have to adhere to various conditions including maintaining tangible net worth of at least million  a minimum debt service coverage ratio of at least to  a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than to and a consolidated current ratio of to we will not be allowed to incur additional debt over million without consent from regions bank 
the actual funding of the finance facility is to commence following effectiveness of the shipyard contract and once we have spent million related to the conversion of the midnight express 
we had spent million related to the conversion as of december  we expect to have spent the million required for the funding of the finance facility by the end of the second quarter of the term loan facility of the finance facility is a three year debt structure with a year amortization payment schedule with semi annual payments 
the pricing for this facility is over libor 
regions bank and edc would require us to maintain the same collateral and covenants as included in the construction financing depicted above 
two conditions remain that the shipyard must fulfill prior to the conversion contract becoming effective 
we have agreed to extend the date by which these conditions must be met to april  if these conditions are not met  the conversion contract will become null and void and we may have to submit the project for re bid 
the delay resulting from re bidding and re awarding the contract could result in substantial delay in delivery of the vessel and thus would cause a delay in the implementation of our deepwater strategy and the start of operations of the midnight express 
additionally  the cost of the contract may increase and we would incur costs to move the vessel to another shipyard 
it is anticipated that the conversion will be performed by another canadian shipyard  however  our inability to complete the conversion in a canadian shipyard would result in the loss of the edc portion of the financing of the conversion 
if we award the project to a shipyard that is not located in canada  we will have to secure additional financing for this project 
in march  we finalized a million  seven year term loan with ge commercial equipment financing ge 
the loan is structured so that we receive million immediately and ge retains million as a security deposit 
the interest rate on the term loan is the day commercial paper rate plus and includes prepayment penalties of for the first twelve months  for the second twelve months and thereafter 
the term loan is structured to have monthly payments over seven years 
the collateral for the loan is the midnight eagle 
we intend to utilize the proceeds from the loan to fund the improvements to the midnight wrangler and a portion of the midnight express conversion costs 
in december  we entered into a purchase agreement with global marine shipping limited global marine for the purchase of the wave alert  to be renamed the midnight wrangler  at a cost of approximately million included in the unconditional purchase obligations in the table below 
we took possession of the vessel in march the purchase of the vessel was financed by global marine over a five year period with monthly payments  including per annum interest  of approximately million plus a million payment at the purchase in march and another million payment at the end of the five year period 
there is no debt recorded on our books as of december   as the purchase was contingent upon delivery of the vessel in march the following table presents our long term contractual obligations and the related amounts due  in total and by period  as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases    unconditional purchase obligations   other long term obligations   total contractual cash obligations    included in long term debt is debt assumed by us as part of the purchase of a leisure fishing vessel from an investment holding company wholly owned by mr 
stockstill to be used for client and provider entertainment purposes 
the total cost of the vessel was approximately million  of which  was paid during the debt assumed will be paid in monthly installments over a five year period 
during  we made payments of approximately million for the operating lease obligation relating to our deepwater technology vessel  the midnight arrow  under a five year charter agreement 
we paid approximately million during in relation to the purchase price and conversion of the midnight express bringing our total as of december  to million 
in addition  we made cash payments of approximately million during related to the three year charter agreement for the midnight hunter  which was terminated in january included in the operating leases are the monthly payments for certain facilities used in the normal course of operations 
however  the majority of the operating leases obligation relates to our five year charter agreement of the midnight arrow 
included in the unconditional purchase obligations and other long term obligations is the purchase of the midnight wrangler as discussed above million and the contracts with equipment suppliers related to the conversion of the midnight express million as well as equipment purchases for the midnight wrangler million 
in august  the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
purchases will be made on a discretionary basis in the open market or otherwise over a period of time as determined by management subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements and other factors 
during   shares were repurchased at a total cost of approximately million 
there has been no repurchase of our common stock since august and under current conditions and to support our vessel expansion strategy we don t expect to repurchase shares in the near future 
as of march    shares had been repurchased at a total cost of million 
consistent with the focus towards investing in newer technology  including deepwater capable assets such as the midnight express and the midnight wrangler  four of the last five vessels added to our operations have been dp deepwater capable midnight eagle  midnight arrow  midnight express and midnight wrangler 
through december   we have expended approximately million in combined capital expenditures and operating lease payments for these vessels  with an additional estimated million to be incurred in associated construction costs  operating lease payments  purchase payments and drydock expenses through see note to the financial statements 
we believe that our existing cash and short term investments and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our existing liquidity needs for the operations of the business 
we also believe that our existing cash and short term investments and the options offered by the bank facility  finance facility and ge term loan  in addition to our cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to complete our identified growth plans 
if our plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate or if we make any additional acquisitions of existing vessels or other businesses  we may need to raise additional capital 
we may not be able to raise these additional funds  or we may not be able to raise such funds on favorable terms 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement will require us to record the fair value of liabilities related to future asset retirement obligations in the period the obligation is incurred 
we adopted sfas no

in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the provisions of this statement revise current guidelines with respect to the process of measuring impairment of long lived assets 
we adopted this statement effective january   such adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which revises current guidance with respect to gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt 
under sfas no 
 gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt are treated as extraordinary items unless they meet the criteria for extraordinary treatment in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january   and as a result  will be required to reclassify the extraordinary losses on early extinguishment of debt from prior periods in future filings as these amounts will no longer qualify for extraordinary treatment under sfas no 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when those liabilities are incurred rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit or disposal activity 
this statement is effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect that sfas no 
will have a material impact on our position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
 which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and the new standard  which is now effective  amends certain disclosure requirements 
we continue to apply apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our stock based compensation  therefore  the alternative methods of transition do not apply 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
see note to the financial statements 
in june  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued an exposure draft of a proposed statement of position sop  accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant  and equipment 
this proposed sop would change  among other things  the method by which companies would account for normal  recurring or periodic repairs and maintenance costs related to in service fixed assets 
it would require that these types of expenses be recognized when incurred rather than recognizing expense for these costs while the asset is productive 
the proposed sop is still under consideration  and uncertainties currently exist with respect to the ultimate timing of its release and its final scope 
we are assessing the impact of the change should this sop  or any portion of this sop  be adopted and will continue to monitor the progress of this proposed standard 
if the portion of this sop relating to planned major maintenance activities is adopted  we would be required to expense regulatory maintenance cost on our vessels as incurred currently capitalized and recognized as drydocking cost amortization  and capitalized costs at the date of adoption would be charged to operations as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies  which are described in note of the notes to our financial statements  represent our critical accounting policies revenue recognition we account for our contracts in progress using the percentage of completion method  as our contracts contain multiple phases of work 
we believe that we have demonstrated the ability to produce reasonably dependable estimates of the costs under such contracts  and that our business has not been subject to the types of inherent risks that would raise questions about the ability of either us or the customer to perform their obligations under the contract or would make otherwise reasonably dependable contract estimates doubtful 
under this method  recognition of earnings on contracts in progress is calculated based on the ratio of costs incurred as of the reporting date to total expected costs to be incurred on each contract 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  insurance and benefits 
general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period during which such losses are first forecast 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost less applicable depreciation 
depreciation is calculated principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of depreciable assets 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
major expenditures for renewals and improvements that extend the useful lives of existing assets  interest incurred during vessel construction  and  when material  vessel construction related overhead and interest are capitalized 
we assess the realizability of our long term assets for impairment when events or certain changes indicate the possibility that the carrying value of any such asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses on long term assets used in operations when the carrying value of those assets is less than the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets 
the net carrying value of assets that are considered to not be fully recoverable are reduced to fair value 
our estimate of fair value represents our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market transactions and is subject to variability 
there have been no impairments in the accompanying financial statements pursuant to sfas no 
for the year ended december  and sfas no 
for previous years 
deferred drydocking charges we are obligated by regulation to periodically incur refurbishment costs known as drydocking costs related to the maintenance and operations of our marine vessels 
we capitalize periodic scheduled drydocking charges when incurred and amortize such costs on a straight line basis over a term that approximates the amount of time until the next required drydocking refurbishment  generally two to three years 
as of december   we had approximately million of deferred drydocking charges  which will be amortized over future periods leading up to the next required refurbishment 
the estimated amortization periods used to recognize such costs involve the use of management s judgment in deriving such estimates 
income taxes before our public offering in june  we had elected to be taxed as a flow through entity under the internal revenue code 
income taxes related to our operations were recognized directly at the individual taxpayer level 
we recognized no federal or state income taxes for the period from to the public offering 
in connection with the public offering  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires the use of the liability method of computing deferred income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the assessment of the realization of deferred tax assets  particularly those related to tax operating loss carryforwards  involves the use of management s judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will realize such tax benefits in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our bank facility when drawn upon and term loan with ge  and potentially our financing facility 
interest on borrowings under the bank facility accrue at a variable rate  using libor plus a range of to  depending upon the level of our consolidated leverage ratio as defined measured on a quarterly basis 
our term loan with ge includes an interest rate consisting of the day commercial paper rate plus 
under the potential financing facility  the interest rate during the construction financing phase will be based upon our consolidated leverage ratio and ranges from a libor spread of to based upon these levels 
the term facility of the financing facility is priced at over libor
