these products include breast implants for aesthetic augmentation and reconstructive surgery following a mastectomy  a range of dermal products to correct facial wrinkles and the lap band and bib systems used to treat severe and morbid obesity 
we generate approximately of our revenues outside the us canada 
demand for our products remains steady notwithstanding economic conditions in our primary markets and the fact that most of our customers do not have access to reimbursement programs for purchases of our products 
with sales of nearly million  and approximately  employees in more than countries  we are a global leader in developing innovative medical devices and implants that improve the quality of life for people around the world 
our primary markets are very competitive and subject to substantial government regulation 
pricing and market share pressures vary by product line and geographic market 
we have experienced increases in our labor and material costs  which are generally influenced by inflationary trends 
in addition  there are foreign currency fluctuations and other risks associated with operating on a global basis  such as price and currency exchange controls  import restrictions  and changing economic  social and political conditions in foreign countries 
we expect these trends and risks to continue 
we will continue to manage these issues by capitalizing on our market leading positions  developing innovative products  investing in human resources  consolidating manufacturing facilities  leveraging our cost structure  and possibly entering into alliances and other arrangements 
we will also seek opportunities where appropriate to limit any potential unfavorable impacts of operating in countries with weakened economic conditions

we sell our breast aesthetics  facial aesthetics and obesity intervention products in the us to hospitals  clinics and doctors through a direct sales force 
internationally  our products are sold either through direct sales forces in countries where we have our own subsidiaries or through third party distributors 
we realize approximately of our revenues from sales in the us canada and internationally 
we manufacture our products in california  costa rica and ireland 
the cost of goods sold represents the cost of raw materials  labor and overhead 
gross margins may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in the selling prices of our products  the mix of products sold  changes in the cost of raw materials  labor and overheads and manufacturing efficiencies inefficiencies 
our selling  general and administrative expense incorporates the expenses of our sales and marketing organization and the general and administrative expenses necessary to support the global corporation

we also conduct research on materials technology  product design and product improvement 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december   an increase of million from million at december  the increase during was the result of cash provided by operations of million and cash from the issuance of common stock of million offset primarily by principal repayments of notes payable and long term debt of million and the purchase of plant and equipment of million 
cash provided by operating activities has been  and is expected to continue to be  our primary source of funds 
cash provided by operations of million in reflects net income of million that was reduced by non cash charges including million of depreciation and amortization  special charges of million and other non cash items  as well as the effect of an increase in trade accounts receivable of million  an increase in accruals and other long term liabilities of million and other changes in assets and liabilities 
cash provided by operations in of million in reflects net income of million that was reduced by non cash charges  including million of depreciation and amortization  and offset by changes in assets and liabilities  including an increase of million in inventories 
this increase in inventories in was primarily to support certain product launches 
these launches included the us launch of the lap band system and the international launch of the hylaform range of products as well as the build up of inventory to support the planned launches of cosmoderm and cosmoplast  our bioengineered human derived collagen dermal filler products 
cash used in investing activities of million in consisted primarily of capital expenditures for our global erp system compared with cash used in investing activities of million in  which consisted primarily of capital expenditures for manufacturing equipment and facilities improvements 
we anticipate spending approximately million to million in on capital projects 
cash used in financing activities in of million reflected principal payments of million on our long term debt  including million of principal prepayments which were partially offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and employee stock options 
cash used in investing activities in of million reflected increases in long term debt of million and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock  offset principally by the repayment of notes payable and long term debt of million and million paid to acquire treasury shares in a stock repurchase program 
we previously repurchased million of our common stock in on december  we amended our term loan agreement to allow us to purchase up to million of our common stock 
we have no stock repurchase program in place as of december  as of december   we had long term debt of million 
principal payments of  and million are due in  and  respectively 
in addition  we have a million revolving line of credit 
we have used million of the revolver capacity as security for certain letters of credit 
the remaining million of revolver capacity is unused as of december  borrowings under the term loan and the revolving line of credit bear interest at a rate equal to either the one  two  three or six month london interbank offered rate libor plus  dropping to libor plus after march  the variable interest rate as of december  applicable to our term notes was approximately 
at december  we had an interest rate swap that fixes the interest rate on million of our long term debt at 
the estimated cost to retire the swap at december  was approximately million 
as part of our million prepayment of long term debt during  we recognized expenses of million relating to unamortized deferred loan fees and recognition of unrealized losses on our interest rate swap 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments at december   and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total total other long term liabilities is million 
the million includes million of the short term portion of the long term obligation 
the primary objectives for our cash investments are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are generally of short duration and high credit quality 
we believe that existing funds  cash generated from operations  and existing debt financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
further  we believe that we will be able to obtain sufficient replacement financing which coupled with our operating cash flow will be in an amount sufficient to repay the existing term loan 
however  we may raise additional capital from time to time 
results of operations sales net sales net of returns  discounts  and allowances  or sales  for were million  an increase of million  or  from sales for were million  a decrease of million  or from foreign exchange effects positively impacted sales by approximately in and negatively by in we expect sales to grow at a low double digit rate in inamed aesthetics breast 
in  sales of breast aesthetics were million  an increase of million  or  from sales for were million  a decrease of million  or  from foreign exchange effects positively impacted sales by approximately in and negatively by in the growth in of breast aesthetic sales was driven by the increase in the number of breast augmentations and reconstructions performed worldwide  and by the launch of new products 
the launch of the style smooth round saline matrix implants and the style and style smooth round silicone gel filled implants in the us coupled with our expanded offering of the cohesive silicone gel matrix product line and the new soft touch cohesive silicone gel matrix in our international markets helped strengthen our position and growth in the breast aesthetics market 
in  sales of breast aesthetics products are expected to grow at a low double digit rate 
inamed aesthetics facial 
in  sales of facial aesthetics were million  an increase of million  or  from sales for were million  a decrease of million  or  from excluding discontinued products  sales of facial aesthetics products in were million  a decrease of from foreign exchange rates had less than a effect on sales and negatively impacted sales by in in we saw strong growth in the us which we attribute to the increasing acceptance of cosmetic procedures  driven primarily by the introduction of allergan s botox into the us market  favorable demographics  focused execution by our sales reps and improved management of average selling prices 
our international facial sales were down in sales growth in europe was positive  but our sales performance declined in japan more than offsetting the european growth 
in  sales of facial aesthetics products are expected to be approximately the same as in due to the potential entry of a competitive product into the us in mid inamed health obesity intervention 
in  sales of obesity intervention were million  an increase of million  or  from the increase in sales was primarily due to the launch of the lap band system in the us following fda approval in june  as well as continued growth in international sales 
sales for were million  an increase of million  or  from foreign exchange effects positively impacted sales by approximately in and negatively by in the significant growth of sales in the us of the lap band system in and can be attributed to an increase in the number of trained and proctored surgeons  enhanced focus on practice building on key accounts  expanded reimbursement coverage and a continued dedication to expanded consumer awareness of the procedure both nationally and regionally 
in  sales of obesity intervention products are expected to grow by to over sales in we expect to achieve this growth by training and qualifying more physicians on the procedure  working to achieve broader reimbursement for the product and the procedure and educating consumers about the benefits of the lap band system 
other products 
other products sales consist of sales of collagen to other manufacturers  and has remained consistent year over year 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was for   and the gross profit margin for was up slightly from this increase reflected the continued improvement in the efficiencies of our manufacturing operations  a change in sales mix and continued implementation of our pricing strategy

see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  attached as exhibit a

selling  general  and administrative sg a in  sg a expenses were million  an increase of million  or  from approximately of the increase is due to the increased promotion of the lap band system and continued promotion of our aesthetic products 
the remaining of the increase is primarily due to increased insurance costs and legal fees associated with various legal matters as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  attached as exhibit a 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses increased to in from in sg a expenses in were million  a decrease of million  or  from this decrease was primarily due to lower legal expenses in and higher expenses incurred in related to the start up of the costa rica manufacturing facility

research and development r d r d expenses were million for  an increase of million  or  from the majority of the expenses related to the clinical development programs for silicone gel filled breast implants  hylaform dermal filler and the botulinum toxin type a clinical trial 
as a percentage of sales  r d expenses remained flat between and r d expenses of million for increased by million  or  from due primarily to an increase in development expense funding for the collaboration with rti and costs related to the development of human collagen 
in  we expect research and development expenses to be within the range of to million  as we continue to pursue our clinical development programs 
restructuring charges in we recorded million of restructuring costs 
this restructuring was undertaken to consolidate manufacturing facilities 
the manufacturing consolidation will lead to improved efficiencies and cost savings 
the consolidation will continue through the beginning of and involves transitioning santa barbara based manufacturing to our facilities in costa rica and ireland 
we will eliminate approximately manufacturing positions in santa barbara and add approximately half of those positions in ireland and costa rica by december the majority of the costs relate to severance which will be paid from the beginning of through early as part of the manufacturing consolidation we have accelerated the depreciation on certain assets with shortened useful lives 
for the year ending december  we incurred million of accelerated depreciation charges included in cost of goods sold on the income statement 
we expect additional accelerated depreciation charges related to this manufacturing consolidation of between million and million through december in  we recorded million of restructuring charges to reflect costs associated with changing senior management and consolidating facilities and administrative functions 
the santa barbara reduction was facilitated by moving certain manufacturing operations to our new facility in costa rica  which began full operation late in  and the move of santa barbara s remaining manufacturing to a local facility 
these costs were primarily employee severance costs 
we do not expect any further material costs related to the restructuring 
special charges in we made an investment in the common stock of advanced tissue sciences  inc  or ats  a supplier of bioengineered human collagen 
in october of  ats announced that it had voluntarily filed for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code  and subsequently announced in november that it decided to undertake an orderly liquidation of its assets 
ats s common stock has been delisted by nasdaq 
as a result  we determined that the investment was permanently impaired and a write off of the entire investment of approximately million was recorded in the quarter ended september  in  we entered into an agreement with reconstructive technologies  inc or  rti  under which we acquired exclusive rights to develop a novel method of tissue expansion for breast reconstruction 
in conjunction with this agreement  we invested million in the capital stock of rti 
during the three months ended june   we made a decision not to pursue this research any further and we determined that the value of this investment was permanently impaired and wrote it off 
in the company entered into an agreement with arthrocare corporation to distribute arthrocare s coblation products in the cosmetic surgery field 
during the three month period ended june   we recorded a charge of approximately million pursuant to a settlement agreement between the company and arthrocare corporation 
during the quarter ended june   we conducted an extensive analysis of our potential sales tax liabilities 
based on the results of this analysis  we accrued an additional liability of million during the quarter 
during the quarter ended march   we recorded a million charge relating to our legal settlement with a former officer of inamed 
during the quarter ended december   we realized gains in the aggregate amount of million in relation to several legal and financial recoveries 
the special charges noted above totaled million for the year ended december  amortization in amortization of intangible assets and non cash compensation was million compared to million in and million in  a decrease of million in the decrease in was due to the adoption of fas  under which goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized 
the increase in was primarily due to amortization of new patents purchased in the third quarter of we expect amortization of intangible assets and non cash compensation expense in to be approximately million 
interest expense net interest and other financing expense totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we had a decrease of million  or  in which is due to lower interest rates and debt levels  but it was offset by a charge in the amount of million for unamortized loan fees and the realization of unrealized losses on our interest rate swap in connection with the million prepayment of debt 
the increase of  million or  in is due to higher debt levels 
included in the interest expense is a million financing charge related to the retirement of the bridge loan used to finance the acquisition of collagen aesthetics  inc foreign currency foreign currency gains and losses fluctuate based largely upon the fluctuation of the dollar to the eu euro and the japanese yen 
on january   eleven of fifteen member countries of the european union  or the eu  established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the eu s common currency  the euro 
during a transition period from january  to june   non cash transactions may be denominated in either euros or the existing currencies of the eu participants 
euro currency was issued in january  and on june   all national currencies of the eu participant countries have become obsolete 
we have evaluated the potential impact of the euro on our european operations and the impact of exchange costs and currency exchange rate risks 
the conversion to the euro did not have a material impact on our operations or financial position in royalty income and other royalty income  net of other expenses  was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the decline in from resulted from the expiration of certain royalty agreements related to breast implants 
income tax expense our effective tax rate was   and  for   and  respectively 
the lower tax rate in relative to was due to the tax benefit of us federal tax refunds 
the lower tax rate in was related to the recognition of certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards  the utilization of miscellaneous tax credits  us charges related to our manufacturing consolidation and other finance charges  all non recurring items 
in addition  our tax rate benefited from a lower state effective tax rate and increased economic activity in low tax jurisdictions 
in  we expect our effective tax rate to be in a range of to 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets and goodwill  income taxes  litigation and warranties 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue  net of sales discounts  returns and allowances  in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements and sfas no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists 
these statements establish that revenue can be recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
we recognize revenue upon delivery of product to third party distributors and customers 
due to the widespread holding of consignment inventory in our industry  we also recognize revenue when the products are withdrawn from consignment inventory in hospitals  clinics and doctors offices 
appropriate reserves are established for anticipated returns and allowances based on our product return history 
we believe our estimates for anticipated returns is a critical accounting estimate because it requires us to estimate returns and  if actual returns vary  it could have a material impact on our reported sales and results of operations 
historically our estimates of return rates have not fluctuated from the actual returns by more than to 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with certain product candidates prior to regulatory approval  based on our judgment of probable future commercialization 
we believe our estimates of inventory values is a critical accounting estimate because we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to  among other factors  a decision denying approval of the product candidate by the necessary regulatory bodies  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are based on the analysis of historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms 
we believe our estimates for our allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we account for long lived assets  other than goodwill in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes sfas no 
and certain sections of apb opinion no 
specific to discontinued operations 
sfas no 
classifies long lived assets as either to be held and used  to be disposed of by other than sale  or to be disposed of by sale 
this standard introduces a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to deal with situations in which alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows 
we have adopted this statement  which has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that an entity review its long lived assets and certain related intangibles for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
with the exception of the manufacturing consolidation that occurred in  see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements  attached as exhibit a  we do not believe that any such changes have taken place 
we also adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  as a result  goodwill is no longer amortized  but is subject to a transitional impairment analysis and is tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
the test for impairment involves the use of estimates related to the fair values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated and is usually based on projected cash flows or market value approach 
other intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  of which periods of up to years 
we believe the estimate of our valuation of long lived assets and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because if circumstances arose that led to a decrease in the valuation it could have a material impact on our results of operations 
income taxes deferred income tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the statutory marginal income tax rate in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the deferred income tax assets or liabilities from period to period 
we believe the estimate of our income tax assets  liabilities and expense are critical accounting estimates because if the actual income tax assets  liabilities and expenses differ from our estimates the outcome could have a material impact on our results of operations 
litigation we are involved in various litigation matters as a claimant and as a defendant 
we record any amounts recovered in these matters when collection is certain 
we record liabilities for claims against us when the losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
amounts recorded are based on reviews by outside counsel  in house counsel  and management 
product warranties we have an accrual for the confidence plus warranty program for our breast implant sales in the united states 
we estimate the amount of potential future claims from this warranty based on actuarial analysis 
expected future obligations are determined based on the history of product shipments and claims and are discounted to a current value 
we believe that our estimate for product warranties is a critical accounting estimate because it requires us to estimate failure rates  claim amounts  and discount rates 
changes to actual claims and interest rates could have a material impact on the actuarial calculation which could materially impact our reported expenses and results of operations 
recent pronouncements on august   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement obligations of tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity increases the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  accretion of the liability is recognized each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement

in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which clarifies disclosure and recognition measurement requirements related to certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after december  and the recognition measurement requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the recognition and measurement provisions of interpretation no 
are effective for newly created variable interest entities formed after january   and for existing variable interest entities  on the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no

certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  the company has complied with the disclosure requirements of sfas and will determine whether it will adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  inamed s operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies 
these fluctuations can vary its cost of financing and operations 
interest rate exposure based on our overall interest rate exposure at december   which was primarily variable rate debt  a hypothetical change in interest rates applied to our outstanding debt as of december   would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
inamed had in place interest rate swap agreements effectively converting approximately million of floating rate to fixed rate debt to hedge interest rate exposures at december  the fixed rate applicable to inamed s interest rate hedge is 
foreign currency exposure inamed s foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the movement of the us dollar relative to the euro and yen 
inamed s transactional currency exposures arise when inamed or one of its subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
inamed also faces currency exposure arising from the translation of the financial results of inamed s global operations into us dollars at exchange rates that have fluctuated during the reporting period 
from time to time  we have entered into agreements to hedge certain foreign currency exposures on commitments  denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
there were no foreign exchange forward contracts  transactions  or open contracts at december  or based on inamed s overall exposure for foreign currency at december   a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on its balance sheet  sales  net income  or cash flows over a one year period
