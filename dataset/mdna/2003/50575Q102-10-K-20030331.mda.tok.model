recent developments change of accountants and chief financial officer 
in september  we replaced pricewaterhousecoopers llp as our independent auditors and engaged eisner llp to act as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending december  our audit committee recommended and approved the decision to change independent auditors 
there were no disagreements in accounting or auditing issues that impacted this decision 
in october  our chief financial officer  who is also the chief financial officer of new valley and other organizations  resigned from his position to devote his full time to his other business obligations 
we appointed salvatore giardina to replace him 
mr 
giardina has been affiliated with ladenburg thalmann co 
since february and has been its chief financial officer since august mr 
giardina has also been our vice president of finance since june renegotiation of clearing arrangement 
we recently completed our clearing conversion with one of our clearing brokers whereby this clearing broker became our primary clearing broker  clearing substantially all of our business 
as part of the new agreement with this clearing broker  we will realize significant cost savings from reduced ticket charges  and expect to realize additional cost savings from other incentives 
in addition  under the new clearing agreement  an affiliate of the clearing broker loaned us the  of clearing loans 
the principal balance of the clearing loans is scheduled to be forgiven as to  in november  in november  in november and in november upon the forgiveness of the clearing loans  the forgiven amount will be accounted for as a reduction of expenses 
however  if the clearing agreement is terminated for any reason prior to the loan maturity dates  the loans  less any amounts that have been forgiven through the date of the termination  must be repaid on demand 
ladenburg capital management 
during the fourth quarter of  in order to reduce future operating expenses  we terminated the ladenburg capital operations and filed to withdraw it as a broker dealer 
ladenburg capital management is currently in the process of winding down its remaining business  including satisfying or collecting all of its outstanding obligations and receivables to the extent possible 
ladenburg thalmann co 
agreed to and is servicing the accounts of ladenburg capital management and many of the employees of ladenburg capital management were offered employment with ladenburg thalmann co 
the termination of the ladenburg capital operations has reduced our support staff expenses  operating expenses and general administrative expenses 
ladenburg capital management has two leases for office space in new york which it no longer occupies  aggregating additional minimum lease payments as of december  of approximately  per year through and  thereafter 
we are currently in litigation with both landlords  and we are attempting to terminate our remaining lease obligations under these leases 
our liabilities at december  include accruals for the estimated expense of these lease terminations  which we believe are adequate 
if we are not successful in terminating these leases  we plan to sublease the properties 
during the year ended december  ladenburg capital management has provided for costs of  in connection with such leases  including the write off of furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements of  and the recording of a liability at december   which gives effect to estimated sublease rentals 
additional costs may be incurred in connection with terminating the leases  or if not terminated  to the extent of foregone rental income in the event ladenburg capital management does not sublease the office space for an amount at least equal to the lease obligations 
such costs may have a material adverse effect on ladenburg capital management s financial position and liquidity 
critical accounting policies a financial reporting release  which was recently issued by the sec  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
general 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
clearing arrangements 
ladenburg thalmann co 
does not carry accounts for customers or perform custodial functions related to customers securities 
ladenburg thalmann co 
introduces all of its customer transactions  which are not reflected in these financial statements  to its clearing broker  which maintains the customers accounts and clears such transactions 
additionally  the clearing broker provides the clearing and depository operations for ladenburg thalmann co 
s proprietary securities transactions 
these activities may expose ladenburg thalmann co 
to off balance sheet risks in the event that customers do not fulfill their obligations with the clearing broker  as ladenburg thalmann co 
has agreed to indemnify its clearing broker for any resulting losses 
we continually assess risk associated with each customer who is on margin and record an estimated loss when management believes collection from the customer is unlikely 
we incurred losses income from these arrangements of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
customer claims 
in the normal course of business  our operating subsidiaries have been and continue to be the subject of numerous civil actions and arbitrations arising out of customer complaints relating to our activities as a broker dealer  as an employer and as a result of other business activities 
in general  the cases involve various allegations that our employees had mishandled customer accounts 
due to the uncertain nature of litigation in general  we are unable to estimate a range of possible loss related to lawsuits filed against us  but based on our historical experience and consultation with counsel  we typically reserve an amount we believe will be sufficient to cover any damages assessed against us 
we have accrued  for customer and non customer arbitration and lawsuit losses as of december  however  we have in the past been assessed damages that exceeded our reserves 
if we misjudged the amount of damages that may be assessed against us from pending or threatened claims  or if we are unable to adequately estimate the amount of damages that will be assessed against us from claims that arise in the future and reserve accordingly  our operating income would be reduced and this could have a material adverse affect on our future consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
september  events 
on september   terrorists attacked the world trade center complex in new york city  which subsequently collapsed and damaged surrounding buildings  including one occupied by a branch office of ladenburg capital management 
these events resulted in the suspension of trading of us equity securities for four business days and precipitated the relocation of approximately employees to ladenburg thalmann co 
s mid town new york headquarters 
although some of ladenburg capital management s businesses were temporarily disrupted  all its businesses remained functioning and serving clients 
we are insured for loss caused by physical damage to property 
this includes repair or replacement of property and lost profits due to business interruption  including costs related to lack of access to facilities 
we will record future reimbursements from insurance proceeds related to certain september  expenses when the reimbursements are actually received 
the net book value of the lost property has been recorded as a receivable as of december  and the insurance proceeds for the lost property will be recorded upon receipt 
insurance proceeds received may vary from the lost property s net book value 
we received insurance proceeds of in july representing an advance relating to damaged property  which was applied against our receivable 
the receivable balance as of december  was  ladenburg capital management has initiated a lawsuit against one of its landlords seeking declaratory judgment that the lease in a building near the world trade center be deemed terminated because  among other things  the premises were unsafe and uninhabitable for a period of days after september   pursuant to a lease provision giving ladenburg capital management the right to terminate in those circumstances 
after the action was commenced  the landlord filed for bankruptcy and the action was automatically stayed by the bankruptcy court 
we anticipate that the bankruptcy court will eventually lift the stay and ladenburg capital management will proceed with the claim 
once the action is recommenced  ladenburg capital management will continue to pursue the claim vigorously and we believe it will prevail on its claim 
however  in the event that ladenburg capital management does not prevail  it may incur additional expense if it is forced to sublet the space 
new accounting pronouncement 
we are currently attempting to terminate two of our existing lease commitments 
during the fourth quarter of  we early adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and applied its provisions to leased premises which were vacated during such periods 
under sfas  a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
for operating leases  a liability for costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its remaining term without economic benefit to the entity shall be recognized and measured at its fair value when the entity ceases using the right conveyed by the lease the cease use date 
the fair value of the liability at the cease use date shall be determined based on the remaining lease rentals  reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
our results of future operations may be impacted to the extent of foregone rental income  in the event we do not sublet the office space for an amount at least equal to our lease obligation 
fair value 
trading securities owned and securities sold  not yet purchased on our consolidated statements of financial condition are carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  with related unrealized gains and losses recognized in our results of operations 
the determination of fair value is fundamental to our financial condition and results of operations and  in certain circumstances  it requires management to make complex judgments 
fair values are based on listed market prices  where possible 
if listed market prices are not available or if the liquidation of our positions would reasonably be expected to impact market prices  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors  including dealer price quotations 
fair values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
changes in the fixed income and equity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting principal trading revenues 
the illiquid nature of certain securities or debt instruments also requires a high degree of judgment in determining fair value due to the lack of listed market prices and the potential impact of the liquidation of our position on market prices  among other factors 
impairment of goodwill and valuation of deferred tax assets 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and were required to analyze our goodwill for impairment issues on january  and on a periodic basis thereafter 
based on the overall declines in the us equity markets and the conditions prevailing in the broker dealer industry  we engaged an independent appraisal firm to value our goodwill as of june  as a result of this valuation  an impairment charge of  of goodwill was indicated and recorded 
the expense is included in the year ended december  the goodwill was generated in the acquisition of the common stock of ladenburg thalmann co 
in may  and the charge reflected overall market declines during for a discussion of the adoption of sfas no 
and the impairment charge  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we account for taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expense on the temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of its assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those timing differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax amounts as of december   which consist principally of the tax benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and accrued expenses  amounts to  after consideration of all the evidence  both positive and negative  especially the fact we have sustained operating losses during and that we continue to be affected by conditions in the economy  management has determined that a valuation allowance at december  was necessary to fully offset the deferred tax assets based on the likelihood of future realization 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  our revenues for decreased  from primarily as a result of decreases in net principal transactions of  offset by an increase in commissions of  our revenues were adversely affected by the overall declines in the us equity markets and the continuing weak operating environment for the broker dealer industry 
for comparative purposes  the period includes revenues generated by the ladenburg capital operations for the full year while the period includes revenues generated by the ladenburg capital operations from may  to december  our expenses for  exclusive of the  goodwill impairment charge  increased the overall net increase includes an increase in rent and occupancy of  an increase in professional services of  and a net increase in various other expenses of  net of decreased employee compensation of  and decreased brokerage  communication and clearance fees of  for comparative purposes  the period includes expenses incurred by the ladenburg capital operations for the full year while the period includes expenses incurred by the ladenburg capital operations from may  to december  our revenues for consisted of commissions of  net principal transactions of  investment banking fees of  syndicate and underwriting income of  interest and dividends of  investment advisory fees of  and other income of  our revenues for consisted of commissions of  net principal transactions of  investment banking fees of  syndicate and underwriting income of  interest and dividends of  investment advisory fees of  and other income of  our expenses for consisted of employee compensation and benefits of  impairment of goodwill of  and other expenses of  our expenses for consisted of employee compensation and benefits of  and other expenses of  the  increase in commissions was primarily the result of the impact of the acquired ladenburg capital operations  which provided additional commission income of  in versus  in the period 
the  decrease in investment banking fees was primarily the result of decreased revenue from private placement and advisory assignments due to the decrease in capital markets activity 
the  decrease in principal transactions was primarily the result of decreases in trading income of  in the period and a decrease in sales credits caused by the continued significant decline in the market for equity securities 
the decrease in compensation expense of  was primarily due to the net decrease in revenues 
based on the overall declines in the us equity markets and the conditions prevailing in the broker dealer industry in  we completed an impairment review and recorded a  charge for the impairment of goodwill  which was generated in the acquisition of the ladenburg capital operations 
the charge reflects overall market declines since the acquisition in may during this review  an independent appraisal firm was engaged to value our goodwill as of june  the appraiser valued our businesses using a weighted average of each unit s projected discounted cash flow  with a weighted average cost of capital of  and a fair market approach using market comparables for ten companies 
the appraiser weighted the discounted cash flow for each unit at and the fair market approach at 
the discounted cash flow was based on management s revised projections of operating results at june  based on this valuation  an impairment charge of  of goodwill was indicated and recorded 
income tax expense for was  compared to in the income tax rate for did not bear a customary relationship to effective tax rates primarily as a result of an increase in the valuation allowance of  state and local taxes and permanent differences 
the income tax rate for did not bear a customary relationship to effective tax rates primarily as a result of the establishment of a valuation allowance of  state and local taxes and permanent differences 
after consideration of all the evidence  both positive and negative  especially the fact we have sustained operating losses during and for the year ended december  and that we continue to be affected by conditions in the economy  management has determined that a valuation allowance at december  was necessary to offset the deferred tax assets based on the likelihood of future realization 
accordingly  during  we increased our valuation allowance to fully offset the deferred tax assets based on the likelihood of future realization 
in addition  the income tax rate for the and periods does not bear a customary relationship to effective tax rates as a result of state and local income tax expense and limitations on the utilization of net operating loss carrybacks 
the year compared to our revenues for increased  from primarily as a result of increases in commissions of  and principal transactions of  offset by decreased investment banking fees of  our expenses for increased  primarily as a result of increased employee compensation of  and increased brokerage  communication and clearance fees of  our revenues for consisted of commissions of  principal transactions of  investment banking fees of  syndicate and underwriting income of  interest and dividends of  investment advisory fees of  and other income of  ladenburg thalmann co

the  decrease in investment banking fees was primarily the result of decreased revenue from private placement and advisory assignments due to the decrease in capital markets activity 
the increase in compensation expense of  was primarily the result of an increase in compensation expense associated with our acquired operations  offset by a decrease in performance based compensation 
income tax expense for was compared to  in the income tax rate for did not bear a customary relationship to effective tax rates primarily as a result of the establishment of a valuation allowance of  state and local taxes and permanent differences 
the income tax rate for did not bear a customary relationship to effective tax rates as a result of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and state and local tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources approximately of our assets at december  are highly liquid  consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents  securities inventories  and receivables from other broker dealers  all of which fluctuate  depending upon the levels of customer business and trading activity 
receivables from broker dealers  which are primarily from our primary clearing broker  turn over rapidly 
as a securities dealer  we may carry significant levels of securities inventories to meet customer needs 
our inventory of market making securities is readily marketable  however  holding large blocks of the same security may limit liquidity and prevent realization of full market value for the securities 
a relatively small percentage of our total assets are fixed 
the total assets or the individual components of total assets may vary significantly from period to period because of changes relating to customer demand  economic and market conditions  and proprietary trading strategies 
our brokerage subsidiary  ladenburg thalmann co 
is subject to the net capital rules of the sec 
therefore  it is subject to certain restrictions on the use of capital and its related liquidity 
ladenburg thalmann co 
s regulatory net capital  as defined  of  exceeded minimum capital requirements of  by  at december  failure to maintain the required net capital may subject ladenburg thalmann co 
to suspension or expulsion by the nasd  the sec and other regulatory bodies and ultimately may require its liquidation 
the net capital rule also prohibits the payment of dividends  redemption of stock and prepayment or payment of principal of subordinated indebtedness if net capital  after giving effect to the payment  redemption or prepayment  would be less than specified percentages of the minimum net capital requirement 
compliance with the net capital rule could limit the operations of ladenburg thalmann co 
that requires the intensive use of capital  such as underwriting and trading activities  and also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital from it  which in turn  could limit our ability to pay dividends and repay and service our debt 
ladenburg thalmann co  as guarantor of its customer accounts to its clearing broker  is exposed to off balance sheet risks in the event that its customers do not fulfill their obligations with the clearing broker 
in addition  to the extent ladenburg thalmann co 
maintains a short position in certain securities  it is exposed to a future off balance sheet market risk  since its ultimate obligation may exceed the amount recognized in the financial statements 
our primary sources of liquidity include cash inflows from operations  borrowings and equity offerings 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the difference is primarily due to an increase in loss for operations 
cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  compared to cash flows provided by investing activities of  for the period 
the difference is primarily attributable to cash received in the lts acquisition in of  net of a decrease in capital expenditures of  the capital expenditures of  in and  in related principally to leasehold improvements and enhancements and improvements to computer equipment 
cash flows provided from financing activities for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the difference is primarily attributable to  in loans received from new valley in compared to  in loans received from new valley and frost nevada in which were repaid in in addition   of loans were received from our primary clearing broker in we are obligated under noncancellable lease agreements  which provide for minimum lease payments  net of lease abatement and exclusive of escalation charges  of  in and approximately  per year until in addition  ladenburg capital management has two leases for office space which it no longer occupies 
ladenburg capital management is currently in the process of terminating the leases and has accrued reserves which we believe are adequate 
if we are not successful in terminating these leases  we plan to sublease the properties 
in this situation  our additional minimum lease payments as of december  are approximately  per year  through and  thereafter 
in conjunction with the acquisition of the ladenburg capital operations  we issued a total of  principal amount of senior convertible promissory notes due december  to new valley  berliner effektengesellschaft ag and frost nevada  limited partnership 
the  principal amount of notes issued to new valley and berliner  the former stockholders of ladenburg thalmann co  bear interest at per annum  and the  principal amount of notes issued to frost nevada  bear interest at per annum 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of  shares of our common stock and are secured by a pledge of the stock of ladenburg thalmann co 
on august   we borrowed  from each of new valley and frost nevada in order to supplement the liquidity of our broker dealer operations 
the loans  which bore interest at above the prime rate  were repaid in january on march   we borrowed  from new valley 
the loan  which bears interest at above the prime rate  was due on the earlier of december  or the completion of one or more equity financings where we receive at least  in total proceeds 
the terms of the loan restrict us from incurring or assuming any indebtedness that is not subordinated to the loan so long as the loan is outstanding 
on july   we borrowed an additional  from new valley collectively  the loans on the same terms as the march loan 
in november  new valley agreed in connection with the clearing loans  to extend the maturity of the loans to december  and to subordinate the loans to the repayment of the clearing loans 
on june   new valley  berliner and frost nevada agreed with us to forbear until may  payment of the interest due to them under the senior convertible promissory notes held by these entities on the interest payment dates of the notes commencing june  through march the forbearance interest payments 
on march   the holders of the senior convertible promissory notes agreed to extend the interest forbearance period to january  with respect to interest payments due through december  interest on the deferred amounts accrues at on the new valley and berliner notes and on the frost nevada note 
we also agreed to apply any net proceeds from any subsequent public offerings to any such deferred amounts owed to the holders of the notes to the extent possible 
as of december   accrued interest payments as to which a forbearance was received amounted to  is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and is included in due to former parent and affiliate 
on october   we borrowed an additional  from new valley 
the loan  which bore interest at above the prime rate  matured on the earliest of december   the next business day after we received our federal income tax refund for the fiscal year ended september   and the next business day after we received the clearing loans in connection with the clearing conversion 
this loan was repaid in december upon receipt of the clearing loans 
ladenburg thalmann co 
also has  outstanding under a junior subordinated revolving credit agreement with an affiliate of its primary clearing broker that matures on october   under which borrowings incur interest at libor plus 
the outstanding  subordinated loan at december  was repaid during in november we consummated the clearing conversion whereby we now clear substantially all of our business through one clearing agent  our primary clearing broker 
as part of the new agreement with this clearing agent  are realizing significant cost savings from reduced ticket charges and other incentives 
in addition  under the new clearing agreement  an affiliate of the clearing broker loaned us the  of clearing loans 
the clearing loans are forgivable over various periods  up to four years from the date of the clearing conversion 
the principal balance of the clearing loans is scheduled to be forgiven as to  in november  in november  in november and in november upon the forgiveness of the clearing loans  the forgiven amount will be accounted for as a reduction of expenses 
however  if the clearing agreement is terminated for any reason prior to the loan maturity dates  the loans  less any amounts that have been forgiven through the date of the termination  must be repaid on demand 
our liquidity position continues to be adversely affected by our inability to generate cash from operations as a result of the continued significant decline in the equity markets 
accordingly  we have been forced to cut expenses as necessary 
in order to accomplish this  we have implemented certain cost cutting procedures throughout our operations including reducing the size of our workforce 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  in order to reduce future operating expenses  we terminated the operations of ladenburg capital management and filed to withdraw it as a broker dealer 
ladenburg thalmann co 
has agreed to and is currently servicing the accounts of ladenburg capital management and many of the employees of ladenburg capital management were offered employment with ladenburg thalmann co 
the termination of ladenburg capital management s operations reduced support expenses  operating expenses and general administrative expenses 
we filed a registration statement in may for a proposed  rights offering to the holders of our outstanding common stock  convertible notes  warrants and options in order to raise additional necessary working capital 
new valley agreed to purchase up to  of our common stock in the proposed rights offering if such shares are otherwise unsubscribed for 
however  on august   we announced that we had decided to postpone the rights offering due to market conditions 
we intend to continue to review the situation during the first half of to determine if conditions for the offering have improved  although we do not currently anticipate that the rights offering can be successfully completed absent a material improvement in market conditions and a significant increase in our stock price 
in the circumstances where the rights offering were ultimately consummated  we would be required to use the proceeds of the proposed rights offering to repay the loans as well as all accumulated forbearance interest payments  to the extent possible 
our overall capital and funding needs are continually reviewed to ensure that our liquidity and capital base can support the estimated needs of our business units 
these reviews take into account business needs as well as regulatory capital requirements of the subsidiary 
based upon these reviews  if the proposed rights offering could be successfully completed  management believes that our capital structure would be adequate for current operations and reasonably foreseeable future needs 
however  because the rights offering is currently postponed and does not appear to be a viable option at this time  should we require additional financing  we will need to seek to raise additional capital through other available sources  including through borrowing additional funds on a short term basis from new valley or from other parties  including our shareholders and our primary clearing broker 
accordingly  if we continue to be unable to generate cash from operations and are unable to find alternative sources of funding  it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 
off balance sheet arrangements the table below summarizes information about our contractual obligations as of december  and the effects these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future years 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt     capital lease obligations operating leases      employment agreement compensation   other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap totals      the employment agreements provide for bonus payments that are excluded from these amounts 
market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates  equity and commodity prices  changes in the implied volatility of interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity and commodity prices and also changes in the credit ratings of either the issuer or its related country of origin 
market risk is inherent to both derivative and non derivative financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of our market risk management procedures extends beyond derivatives to include all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
current and proposed underwriting  corporate finance  merchant banking and other commitments are subject to due diligence reviews by our senior management  as well as professionals in the appropriate business and support units involved 
credit risk related to various financing activities is reduced by the industry practice of obtaining and maintaining collateral 
we monitor our exposure to counterparty risk through the use of credit exposure information  the monitoring of collateral values and the establishment of credit limits 
we maintain inventories of trading securities 
at december  the fair market value of our inventories were  in long positions and  in short positions 
we performed an entity wide analysis of our financial instruments and assessed the related risk 
based on this analysis  in the opinion of management  the market risk associated with our financial instruments at december  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations
