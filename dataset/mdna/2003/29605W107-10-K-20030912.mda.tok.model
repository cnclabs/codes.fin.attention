this increase was in part the result of higher sales of coins of approximately  as well as an increase in stamp revenue of approximately  the increase in stamp sales was due to sales to afinsa bienes tangibles sa afinsa  a related party  in the amount of  the combined gains from coin and stamps were reduced by  due to the sale of the comic and movie poster division in september for the year ended june   operating revenues contained comic book sales and auctions of  also there was a decrease of due to a softening of the sports market 
the company has entered into an agreement with afinsa pursuant to which it  or one of its subsidiaries  will act as exclusive supplier of collectibles for afinsa on a worldwide basis 
it is expected that commencing in the year ended june   the company will generate additional revenues earned under that agreement 
the variation in any year in the composition of total revenues as between revenues resulting from inventory sales and commissions resulting from consignment sales is largely a function of availability  market demand and conditions rather than any deliberate attempt by the company to emphasize one area over the other 
sellers consignors of property to the company generally make their own determinations as to whether the property should be sold to the company for the specified price offered by the company or offered for sale at auction at a price that cannot be predicted in advance 
such determination is based on the potential risks and rewards involved  and includes an evaluation of the marketability of the property and the potential pool of buyers 
the company engages in a similar analysis in determining whether to acquire inventory for its own account and the price it is willing to pay for such inventory 
gross profit increased to approximately  for the year ended june  from approximately  for the year ended june  this represents an increase of approximately  
included in the cost of merchandise sold are reserves recorded to reflect management s estimate of net realizable value of inventories relating to price variability of approximately and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
a significant amount of the increased gross profit was derived from direct sales of two large specialty collections to afinsa a related party in the fourth quarter 
stamp sales to afinsa are expected to continue in the ensuing quarters although the amount may fluctuate 
additional gross profit from higher coin sales was approximately gross profit percentage increased from for the fiscal year end to for fiscal year end the largest contributing factor to the increase in gross profit percentage was  in direct sales of two large specialty collections to afinsa a related party in the fourth quarter 
exclusive of sales to afinsa  the gross profit percentage for fiscal would be as compared to for fiscal the increase was the result of higher gross profit margins on auction sales of owned stamp inventory  which is reflective of the improvement in quality and pricing of stamp purchases by the company 
the gross profit percentage can vary depending on the market demand and market conditions relative to each type of the product being sold and the proportion of the revenue mix between sales of merchandise and commissions earned  whereby sales of merchandise as compared to commissions earned yield a gross profit of less than operating expenses the decrease in total operating expenses  in combination with the revenue increases had the effect of decreasing total operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue from during the year ended june  to in the year ended june  the company recorded expenses relating to bad debt of and for and  respectively 
over the past five years the average ratio of bad debt to aggregate sales was less than 
the company s aggregate operating expenses  exclusive of cost of merchandise sold  for the year ended june  was approximately  compared with approximately  for the year ended june   representing a decrease of approximately  
included in the operating loss for the year ended june  are expenses relating to intangible impairments of  as compared to in the year ended june  the intangible impairment charges were based on future discounted cash flows as further described in the company s critical accounting policies 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended june  exclusive of intangible impairments decreased from approximately  in the year ended june  to approximately in the year ended june  depreciation decreased and amortization in the year ended june  the reduction of amortization expense is the result of the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no as of july  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
the test conducted for year ended june  resulted in no impairments 
g a expenses decreased approximately in year ended june  when compared to in large part due to charges of of service fees for greg manning direct in the year ended june  with in the year ended june  salaries increased in the year ended june  due in part to an increase in personnel to handle the increase in coin and stamp inventory and corresponding sales but also in the form of bonuses both contractual   and discretionary  interest income and expense interest expense increased approximately to approximately for the year ended june  as compared to that of the previous year largely due to financing for specific inventory purchases with the seller 
interest income increased during the year ended june  by approximately 
the interest income in the year ended june  was lower due to the write off of finance charges  which were deemed uncollectible 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate for the year ended june  and were approximately and  respectively 
the difference relates to a state tax expense for as compared to an increase in the valuation allowance provided for all deferred tax asset attributes in this rate may change in future periods if operating results or acquisition related costs differ significantly from current projections 
during  both the state of new jersey and california passed tax legislation  which  among other things  requires the suspension of the use of state net operating loss carry forwards for two years 
as a result  there is provision for state income taxes for the year ended june  in order to compensate for the suspension of the state net operating losses  the period of availability has been extended by two years 
net income loss the company recorded net income for the year ended june  of approximately  compared to a loss of approximately  for the year ended june  an increase of net income of approximately  during this period 
the increase in gross profit of approximately  a reduction of depreciation and amortization expense including intangible impairment of approximately  the gain on sale of an equity method investee of  to afinsa related party and a reduction in tax expense of  made up the change in net income for the fiscal ended june  in comparison the fiscal year ended june  the tax expense of  in the fiscal year ended june  was the result of an increase in the valuation allowance provided for all deferred tax asset attributes in results of operations years ended june  and dollars in thousands except as noted or per share information revenues for the year ended june   operating revenues increased approximately  to approximately  compared with approximately  for the year ended june  this increase is largely attributable to an increase in sales of owned inventory of approximately  
this increase was entirely the result of higher sales of coins of approximately  the increase in coin revenue was partially offset by a decrease in commission revenue of approximately  a decrease of  due to the sale of the comic and movie poster division in september and a decrease of  due to a softening of the sports market 
the variation in any year in the composition of total revenues as between revenues resulting from inventory sales and commissions resulting from consignment sales is largely a function of availability  market demand and conditions rather than any deliberate attempt by the company to emphasize one area over the other 
sellers consignors of property to the company generally make their own determinations as to whether the property should be sold to the company for the specified price offered by the company or offered for sale at auction at a price that cannot be predicted in advance

included in cost of merchandise sold are reserves recorded to reflect management s estimate of net realizable value of inventories relating to price variability of approximately   and for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the increased gross profit also reflects a stronger realization of inventory value resulting from management s aggressive program to lower inventory balances of poorly performing inventory by selling such inventory to generate cash and meet working capital needs  which was initiated in fiscal the company s program consisted of selling inventory in order to generate cash 
inventory turnover in this industry is relatively low because goods are sold depending on market conditions as to not flood the market and are held in inventory until their peak values 
the aggressive program also refers to the company selling inventory to meet working capital needs instead of waiting for peak market conditions 
in general  in the collectibles industry  inventory turnover is relatively low  as goods are sold depending on market conditions to avoid flooding the market and with an eye toward holding inventory until it reaches its peak value 
beginning in fiscal year  to generate cash and to meet working capital needs  the company sold inventory based upon need rather than waiting for values to peak 
operating expenses the increase in operating expenses  in combination with the revenue increases had the effect of decreasing operating costs as a percentage of operating revenue from during the year ended june  to in the year ended june  the company recorded expenses relating to bad debt of 
of aggregate sales in fiscal and 
of aggregate sales during fiscal over the past five years including fiscal and fiscal the average ratio of bad debt to aggregate sales was less than 
the company s aggregate operating expenses  for the year ended june  totaled approximately  compared with approximately  for the year ended june   representing an increase of approximately  or 
included in the operating loss for fiscal are expenses relating to intangible impairments of  as compared to  in fiscal and although this represents an increase of  it was offset by reductions in all other expenses 
the intangible impairment charges were based on future discounted cash flows as further described in the company s critical accounting policies 
the primary decreases in the operating expenses for the year ended june  from the prior year were decreases in salaries and wages of approximately  a decrease in acquisition and merger costs of and other expenses decreasing 
interest income and expense interest expense decreased approximately to approximately for the year ended june  as compared to that of the previous year 
this decrease was attributable to lower average borrowings caused primarily by the repayment of loans as well as a reduction of the loan guarantee fee paid to greg manning from in the year ended june  to in the year ended june  interest income decreased during the year ended june  by approximately 
this was caused by an overall decrease in advances to consignors 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate benefit for the year ended june  and were approximately and  respectively 
the difference relates to an increase in the valuation allowance provided for all deferred tax asset attributes 
this rate may change in future periods if operating results or acquisition related costs differ significantly from current projections 
net income loss the company recorded a net loss for the year ended june  of approximately  compared to approximately  for the year ended june  and reflected a decreased loss of approximately  during this period 
the increase in gross profit of approximately  during the year ended june   was the main contributing factor  while a decrease in the loss from operations of investee of approximately  from fiscal and an increase in the provision for income taxes benefit of approximately  compared to the previous year offset each other 
european monetary union the european monetary unit the euro was introduced on january  as a wholesale currency 
the eleven participating european monetary union member countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the euro 
the existing currencies will continue to be used as legal tender through january   thereafter  on july   the existing currencies will be cancelled and euro bills and coins will be used for cash transactions in the participating countries 
the company believes that it s european financial and cash management operations affected by the euro conversion have adequately been prepared for its introduction 
the company is able to determine the ultimate financial impact  if any  of the euro conversion on its operations  given that the impact will be dependent upon the competitive situations that exist in the various regional markets in which the company participates 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangement that has or is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities the company experienced a negative cash flow from operating activities of approximately  for the year ended june  as compared to a negative cash flow of approximately for  a decrease of approximately inventory purchases resulted in a decrease in cash flow of  in from a positive cash flow of  in the large difference was due to the purchase of large collections in the fourth quarter of of both coins and philatelics 
accordingly  because of the inventory purchases there was a positive cash flow of  in from accounts payable as compared to a negative cash flow of in or a net change of  overall there was a positive change in cash and cash equivalents in of the company experienced a negative cash flow from operating activities of approximately for the year ended june  as compared to a positive cash flow of approximately for  a decrease of approximately  this decrease in cash flow for the year ended june  was primarily attributable to a decline in the net change in inventory of approximately  as compared to a decrease of  in year ended june  investing activities the company had negative cash flow from investing activities of approximately for the year ended june   which was mainly comprised of payments for capital expenditures of and a loan to a related party in the amount of the company had a negative cash flow from investing activities of approximately for the year ended june  as compared to a negative cash flow of for the year ended june  or an increase of the reduction in negative cash flow in was attributable to a decline in capital expenditures in the amount of approximately offset by proceeds from the sale of an equity method investee in the amount of financing activities the company had positive cash flow from financing activities of approximately  during  the company had additional borrowings of from demand notes payable related party 
the company also established a new line of credit with banco santander hispano  sa  on april  with borrowings of  these increases were offset by the repayment of  relating to notes payable and capital leases 
additionally there was an increase in cash from the exercise of options of under an agreement dated march   gmai sold all of its then outstanding interest in gmai asia to afinsa for  consisting of  shares of gmai asia 
com common stock 
the proceeds from the sale were used to pay off all amounts outstanding under gmai s revolving line of credit with afinsa 
the company had positive cash flow from financing activities of approximately in the year ended june  or a decrease of compared to fiscal fiscal year ended part of the decrease in fiscal was due to a total reduction in debt of  and a decrease of in proceeds from the sale of common stock 
in there were no purchases of treasury stock as opposed to a purchase of  of treasury stock in credit and financing facilities the company s credit and financing facilities  which are included in the above discussion  consist of the following on april   gmai entered into a revolving credit agreement with banco santander central hispano  sa for a credit facility of up to  borrowings under this facility bear interest at a rate of prime plus 
the agreement has been guaranteed by afinsa and requires that auctentia maintain ownership of at least of the outstanding shares of voting stock of gmai 
the agreement expires on april  the agreement contains other standard agreements and covenants 
at june   gmai had borrowed  under this facility 
the company has a secured loan from a privately held capital fund in the amount of  as of on june  the loan is collateralized by inventory and has an interest rate of 
the loan is due december  the company has a note payable  collateralized by specific coin inventory with an interest rate of with quarterly payments of commencing in april until the loan maturity date in august borrowing under this note were as of june  such amounts were repaid as of the date of this report 
the remaining notes payable consist of capital leases for the purchase of equipment bearing interest at rates ranging from to 
total borrowings outstanding under the leases were as of june  during  the company entered into an agreement with afinsa pursuant to which afinsa agreed to provide the company with a revolving credit facility of up to  borrowings under that facility bear interest at an annual rate of 
the agreement also provided that any borrowings not repaid in accordance with the terms of the agreement could have been converted into gmai stock at the discretion of afinsa 
the agreement expired october and was renewed for an additional six months 
all borrowings under this facility were repaid in march and this renewed facility has expired 
no borrowings under this facility were converted into gmai stock 
as of june   the company had an aggregate of  of debt outstanding under the above credit and financing facilities 
need for future liquidity the company s need for liquidity and working capital may increase as a result of its continuing business expansion activities 
in addition to the need for such capital to enhance the company s ability to offer cash advances to a larger number of potential consignors of property which is an important aspect of the marketing of an auction business  the company may require additional working capital in the future in order to acquire collectibles for sale in the company s business  to expand into sales of other collectibles and to initiate any other new business activities 
management believes that the company s cash flow from ongoing operations supplemented by the company s working capital credit facilities will be adequate to fund the company s working capital requirements for the next months 
however  to make any additional significant acquisitions  the company may consider exploring financing alternatives  including increasing its working capital credit facilities or raising additional debt or equity capital 
the raising of additional equity capital will cause dilution to existing shareholders 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations related to non cancelable operating and capital leases at june  were as follows payment due by period less more than than total year years years years demand notes   long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations  total   the company has a commercial commitment as of june  consisting of a guarantee of  of indebtedness of china everbright bank  which was entered into in connection with certain transactions involving gmai asia 
under an agreement dated march   gmai sold all of its then outstanding interest in gmai asia for  consisting of  shares of gmai asia 
com common stock 
the proceeds from the sale were used to pay off all amounts outstanding under gmai s revolving line of credit with afinsa 
the gmai guarantee is still outstanding  however  afinsa has agreed to indemnify gmai for any obligation or liability under the guarantee 
auction cycles a buyer of auctioned property may be permitted to take possession of the property before payment is made 
most accounts receivable are collected within to days  which is consistent with business practice in the collectible markets 
for the years ended june  and the company s expense relating to bad debt was approximately and respectively 
for the years ended june  and the company s history of bad debts has been less than of revenue 
because of the nature of the auction business of the company  there is a relationship between accounts receivable  advances to consignors  and payable to consignors 
depending upon the relationship of the balance sheet date to a given auction sale date and a settlement date for a given auction  these balances could change substantially from one balance sheet date to another 
in the cycle of any single auction  the effect on the balance sheet and on the company s cash flows is significant when compared to the total assets of the company 
the cycle for a single auction begins with consignors contracting with the company to sell their property at auction 
typically these contracts are signed from to weeks in advance of the auction sale date 
no entry is made on the balance sheet of the company when the company receives the property for auction or when a contract for the consignment to the auction is signed 
since the contract for the sale of the property is for services not yet rendered  there is no financial statement impact 
at the time of the consignment  or any time thereafter until the auction sale date  the consignor may request a cash advance which is a prepaid portion of the prices to be realized of the property irrevocably committed to be sold in the auction 
the cash advance takes the form of a self liquidating  secured loan to the consignor  using the property consigned as collateral 
cash advances to consignors are often used as a marketing tool in order to obtain property for a sale 
when the cash advance is made  there is an increase of the accounts of the company in cash advances to consignors  and simultaneously  there is a corresponding decrease in cash 
approximately weeks after the auction date  often referred to as the settlement date  the payables to consignors decrease to zero as all the consignors are paid and the company withholds a portion of the amounts due the consignor for the sale of the property as an offset to repay the principal amount and the accrued interest on the cash advances to consignors or loans to consignors  and there is a decrease in cash  corresponding to the net amount paid to the consignors 
the entire cycle for a single auction typically is about to weeks in duration 
because of the high level of activity in the company  single auction cycles do not occur in series  with the next cycle beginning immediately after the previous cycle ends 
rather  single auction cycles occur in parallel 
for example  when a certain cycle ends  a second cycle may be at the midpoint  while yet a third cycle is just beginning 
depending upon the relative values of the property consigned to each sale in the three cycles in this example  and depending upon the demand for auction advances in each of the cycles  the cumulative effect on the balance sheet  and particularly the current assets and current liabilities and the company s cash flows  is very significant 
inflation the effect of inflation on the company has not been significant during the last three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which the company relies are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that the company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following o revenue recognition o allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns o inventory valuation and classification o goodwill and intangible assets o accounting for income taxes in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
our senior management has reviewed the company s critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
revenue recognition the company derives revenues from two primary sources auction revenue revenue is recognized when collectibles are sold at auction and is represented by an auction commission received from the buyer and seller 
auction commissions represent a percentage of the hammer price at auction sales as paid by the buyer and the seller 
such amounts of revenue are recorded on a net basis as commission revenue 
the company also sells its own inventory at auction 
revenue of owned inventory is recognized when sold at auction 
such amounts of revenue are recorded on a gross basis as sales of merchandise 
additionally  the company is entitled to auction commissions paid by the buyer 
sales returns have not been material 
private treaty sales private treaty sales represent sales of consigned property and sales of owned inventory 
private treaty sales of consigned property occur when an owner of property arranges with the company to sell such consigned property to a third party at a privately negotiated price 
in such a transaction  the owner may set selling price parameters for the company  or the company may solicit selling prices for the owner  and the owner may reserve the right to reject any selling price 
the company does not guarantee a fixed price to the owner  which would be payable regardless of the actual sales price ultimately received 
the company recognizes as private treaty revenue an amount equal to a percentage of the sales price 
such amounts of revenue are recorded on a net basis as commission revenue and are recognized when sold 
private treaty sales of owned inventory occur when the company sells its goods directly to a customer either wholesale or retail 
revenue with respect to private treaty revenues is recognized when delivered or released to the customer for acceptance or to a common carrier for delivery 
such amounts of revenue are recorded on a gross basis as sales of merchandise 
sales returns have not been material 
the company does not provide any guarantee with respect to the authenticity of property offered for sale at auction 
each lot is sold as genuine and as described by the company in the catalogue 
when however  in the opinion of a competent authority mutually acceptable to the company and the purchaser  a lot is declared otherwise  the purchase price will be refunded in full if the lot is returned to the company within a specified period 
in such event  the company will return such lot to the consignor before a settlement payment has been made to such consignor for the lot in question 
to date  returns have not been material 
large collections are generally sold on an as is basis 
allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns the company makes judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding auction and consignor advances receivables and provides allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
the company continuously monitors payments from its customers and maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the period they become known 
the company frequently extends trade credit in connection with its auction sales  which are held throughout the united states 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis  generally the customers who receive trade credit are professional dealers who have regularly purchased property at the company s auctions or whose reputation within the industry is known and respected by the company 
in situations where trade credit is extended  the purchaser generally takes possession of the property before payment is made by the purchaser to the company  and the company is liable to the consignor for the net sales proceeds auction hammer price less commission to the company 
the company pays the consignor generally not later than the th day after the sale  and when trade credit is extended  the company assumes all risk of loss associated with the trade credit  and the responsibility of collection of the trade credit amount from the purchaser 
losses to date under these situations have not been material 
certain significant sales of inventory owned by the company are made with extended payment terms up to twelve months 
certain assets held by the company collateralize these significant receivables 
if the historical data the company uses to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
in recording any additional allowances  a respective charge against income is reflected in the general and administrative expenses  and would reduce our operating results in the period in which the increase is recorded 
inventory valuation and classification inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market lcm  which reflects management s estimates of net realizable value 
inventories are accounted for under the specific identification method 
in instances where bulk purchases are made  the cost allocation is based on the estimated market values of the respective goods 
the company periodically reviews the age and turnover of its inventory to determine whether any inventory has declined in value and incurs a charge to operations for such declines 
the company records write downs based on two methodologies  specific write downs on certain items based on declines in the marketplace  and estimated write downs based on a percentage of the inventory aging by category type  unless the company implores a marketing strategy to sell goods over time 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management and the company s estimates prove to be inaccurate  additional write downs or adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required 
increases in write downs and adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified and a resulting charge to cost of merchandise sold is recorded which would reduce our operating results in the period in which the increase is recorded 
in certain instances  the company holds inventory for a period of time in excess of one year  which is generally based on a marketing strategy to sell collectibles over time in order to avoid flooding the marketplace 
inventories  which are not expected to be sold within one year  are classified with other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets goodwill goodwill primarily includes the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of net assets acquired 
effective july   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  the company ceased amortization of goodwill and tests its goodwill on an annual basis using a two step fair value based test 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
management has determined that it operates as one reporting unit and therefore assesses goodwill for impairment on an enterprise wide basis 
management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using the company s market capitalization  which determines if the carrying value of goodwill is impaired 
if impairment is determined  the company will recognize additional charges to operating expenses in the period in which they are identified  which would result in a reduction of operating results and a reduction in the amount of goodwill 
prior to the adoption of sfas on july   the company amortized goodwill over its estimated useful life and evaluated goodwill for impairment in conjunction with its other long lived assets 
other intangible assets other purchased intangibles consisting of trademarks and customer list  purchased as part of business acquisitions are presented net of related accumulated amortization and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining useful lives 
the company records impairment losses on other intangible assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired and the estimated fair value of the asset is less than its recorded amount in accordance with sfas no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews the value of its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include material adverse changes in operations  significant adverse differences in actual results in comparison with initial valuation forecasts prepared at the time of acquisition  a decision to abandon certain acquired products  services or marketplaces  or other significant adverse changes that would indicate the carrying amount of the recorded asset might not be recoverable 
annually  the company performs this analysis with assistance from an independent valuation expert 
the company evaluates the recoverability of other purchased intangibles using undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in performing these analyses uses the best information available in the circumstances including reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the income tax expense provision 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered 
the company assesses the likelihood of our deferred tax assets being recovered from future taxable income 
the company then provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which the company does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased in the future to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on net income in the period in which such determination is made

the cautionary statements set forth below identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company o the company s debt agreements expire at various times during the next twelve months 
the company has previously been able to refinance or renegotiate these agreements in the past 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to accomplish this in the future 
o at times there may be a limited supply of collectibles available for sale by the company  as well as the auctentia subsidiaries 
such supply historically has varied from time to time 
while neither the company nor the auctentia subsidiaries have generally experienced a lack of collectibles that has prevented them from conducting appropriately sized auctions on an acceptable schedule  no assurance can be given that the company or the auctentia subsidiaries will be able to obtain consignments of suitable quantities of collectibles in order to conduct auctions of the size  and at the times  the company may desire in the future 
the inability to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company 
furthermore  the popularity of collectibles could decline 
this could affect the market value of inventory that gmai currently holds  including the inventory acquired under the inventory purchase agreement  or inventory it  cdc and the auctentia subsidiaries may acquire in the future 
o the business of selling stamps  coins  and other collectibles at auction and in retail sales is highly competitive 
the company and the auctentia subsidiaries compete with a number of auction houses and collectibles companies throughout the united states and the world 
while the company believes that there is no dominant company in the stamp auction or collectibles business in which it or the auctentia subsidiaries operate  there can be no assurances that other companies with greater financial and other resources and name recognition will not enter the market 
among the primary competitors in the domestic and worldwide philatelic auction business are matthew bennett  inc  charles shreve galleries  inc  hr harmer  robert a 
siegel  philatelists on line and ebay 
with respect to sports trading card and sports memorabilia auction business  the primary competitors are lelands  mastro auctions  sotheby s  collector s universe and ebay 
with respect to coin operations  the main competitors are heritage  stacks  collector s universe  bower s and merena  and superior 
with respect to internet operations  the market for internet products and services is highly competitive and there are no substantial barriers to entry 
gmai expects that competition will continue to intensify 
many of gmai s internet competitors have more experience than we have maintaining internet operations and have greater brand recognition 
o as a result of the issuance of  shares to auctentia on september  in connection with the consummation of the share purchase agreement  the inventory purchase agreement and the subscription agreement  auctentia and its affiliates currently beneficially own approximately of the issued and outstanding shares of gmai s common stock 
this represents a substantial dilution in the current voting power of non auctentia related stockholders of gmai 
as a result  auctentia and its affiliates will be able to elect the entire board of directors of gmai 
auctentia and its affiliates also may be able to approve other actions as a stockholder without obtaining the votes of other stockholders of gmai or impede transactions that may be desirable for other stockholders 
in addition  this concentration of ownership  which is not subject to any voting restrictions  could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for gmai s common stock 
o gmai and auctentia have signed a registration rights agreement pursuant to which auctentia may request that  shares of gmai common stock beneficially owned by it including  warrants to purchase gmai common stock be registered by gmai at gmai s expense 
auctentia has agreed that the  shares of gmai stock it receives pursuant to the share purchase agreement will not be sold or otherwise transferred for a period of months following the closing 
all other registrable gmai common stock owned by auctentia that is  approximately of the outstanding shares of gmai common stock will be freely tradable immediately after any registration 
o the transactions contemplated by the share purchase agreement will present challenges to management  including the integration of the operations  product lines  technologies and personnel of gmai and the auctentia subsidiaries  and special risks  including possible unanticipated liabilities  unanticipated costs and diversion of management attention 
gmai cannot be certain that it will successfully integrate or profitably manage the auctentia subsidiaries business 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the combined businesses will achieve increased sales levels  profitability  efficiencies or synergies or that the transactions contemplated by the share purchase agreement will result in increased earnings for the combined companies in any future period 
the difficulties of combining the operations of gmai and the auctentia subsidiaries are complicated by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of gmai s businesses  including the businesses acquired in the transactions 
additionally  the combined companies may experience slower rates of growth as compared to historical rates of growth of gmai and the auctentia subsidiaries independently 
o the company s future success depends to a significant extent on its retaining services of senior management and other key personnel  particularly gmai s president and chief executive officer  greg manning  and the president of spectrum numismatics international  inc  greg roberts 
gmai s business would be adversely affected if for any reason it failed to retain the services of messrs 
manning or roberts and failed to engage suitable replacements 
o gmai s operations may be adversely affected by governmental regulation and taxation of the internet  which is subject to change 
a number of legislative and regulatory proposals under consideration by federal  state  local and foreign governmental organizations may result in enactment of laws concerning various aspects of the internet  including online content  user privacy  access charges  liability for third party activities and jurisdictional issues 
these laws could harm the company s business by increasing its cost of doing business or discouraging use of the internet 
o the company s business will be adversely affected if use of the internet by consumers  particularly purchasers of collectibles  does not continue to grow 
a number of factors may inhibit consumers from using the internet 
these include inadequate network infrastructure  security concerns  inconsistent quality of service and a lack of cost effective high speed service 
even if internet use grows  the internet s infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth and its performance and reliability may decline 
in addition  many web sites have experienced service interruptions as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet infrastructure 
if these outages or delays occur frequently in the future  use of the internet  as well as use of our web sites  could grow more slowly or decline 
o in addition  the tax treatment of the internet and electronic commerce is currently unsettled 
a number of proposals have been made that could result in internet activities  including the sale of goods and services  being taxed 
the us congress has passed the us internet tax information act  placing a moratorium on new state and local taxes on internet commerce through november  there may  however  be enacted in the future laws that change the federal  state or local tax treatment of the internet in a way that is detrimental to our business 
o some local telephone carriers claim that the increasing popularity of the internet has burdened the existing telecommunications infrastructure and that many areas with high internet use are experiencing interruptions in telephone service 
these carriers have petitioned the us federal communications commission to impose access fees on internet service providers 
if these access fees are imposed  the cost of communicating on the internet could increase  and this could decrease the demand for our services and increase our cost of doing business 
o the company holds rights to various web domain names 
governmental agencies typically regulate domain names 
these regulations are subject to change 
gmai may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which it or its affiliates do business 
furthermore  regulations governing domain names may not protect the company s trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
the company may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to  infringe upon or diminish the value of its trademarks and other proprietary rights 
o the company cannot accurately forecast revenues of its business or the business of the auctentia subsidiaries  particularly with respect to stamp auction operations 
due to difficulty anticipating levels or values of consignments at any given time  the stamp auction business is susceptible to significant fluctuations in operating results and revenue shortfalls  which could adversely affect the company s business 
in addition  gmai s operating results in the coin business are dependent upon product availability over the short and long term  which cannot be predicted with any certainty 
future fluctuations in operating results or revenue shortfalls of the company or the auctentia subsidiaries could adversely affect the success of the company 
if revenue fails to offset operating expenses in the future  the company may be required to fund future operations through the sale of additional common stock  which could cause the market price of its stock to decline  as well as have a dilutive effect on the value of its common stock currently outstanding 
in addition  the company may be adversely affected by the loss of one or more major customers 
o the market price of gmai common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  some of which may be beyond gmai s control  including sales of gmai common stock by stockholders  actual or anticipated fluctuations in gmai s operating results  the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies  developments and publicity regarding gmai s industry  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of gmai common stock  regardless of gmai s actual performance  and could enhance the effect of any fluctuations that do relate to its operating results 
o the company may be adversely affected by the costs and other effects associated with i legal and administrative cases and proceedings  ii settlements  investigations  claims and changes in those items  and iii adoption of new  or changes in  accounting policies and practices and the application of such policies and practices 
o gmai has incurred net losses of   and  for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
through the transactions with auctentia and otherwise  gmai is seeking to reduce operating expenses  optimize profitability and align resources with long term business growth strategies  as well as to explore new sources of collectibles in an effort to increase margins and revenues from commissions 
there can be no assurance that these steps or any others will result in a significant improvement in gmai s financial condition  on either a short or long term basis 
although the company s results of operations for the year ended june  reflect a significant improvement over recent years results  a significant portion of the gross profit for the year was attributable to sales to one related party 
a decrease in the level of sales to this party could have a material adverse effect on the company 
o the company s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards promulgated by the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission  and the american institute of certified public accountants 
this list should not be considered an exhaustive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not believe that it is exposed to significant market risk through interest rate risks  foreign currency exchange risks  commodity price risks or other similar market risks 
the company s interest rates are generally market based 
in addition  because its business is operated primarily in the united states of america  its transactions are executed in us dollars 
subsequent to the closing of the transactions with auctentia as discussed above  we will have business operations in europe  however  all transactions in europe will be executed and settled in euros 
the company will assess the significance of interest rate  exchange rate and other market risk on a periodic basis and will implement strategies to manage risk as appropriate
