critical accounting policies and estimates allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors  namely aging and historical trends 
delinquent accounts are written off automatically after the passage of days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely 
for all other accounts  the company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the accounts are past due and the anticipated future write offs based on historical experience 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million or of gross receivables at february   million or of gross receivables at february  and million or of gross receivables at february  the components of the allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows fiscal year ended february  february  february  in thousands accounts receivable allowances balance at beginning of year charged to costs and expenses deductions bad debts written off  net of recoveries and other allowances balance at end of year retail inventory method and inventory valuation the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the last in  first out lifo basis using the retail inventory method rim 
under rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value inventories 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
the use of the retail inventory method will result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
based on a review of historical clearance markdowns  current business trends and discontinued merchandise categories  an adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market 
management believes that the company s inventory valuation approximates the net realizable value of clearance inventory and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
vendor allowances the company records vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled 
allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and  accordingly  are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated 
vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce the company s expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program 
reserve estimates the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by its associates 
the company determines the estimates for the liabilities associated with these risks by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from the current assumptions and historical trends 
under its workers compensation and general liability insurance policies  the company retains the initial risk of  and  respectively  per occurrence 
capital versus operating leases the company evaluates all lease agreements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  to determine whether a lease is operating or capital

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates or borrowings 
at february   the company s long term debt  excluding capital leases  was  million  all of which is fixed rate debt 
long term fixed rate debt is utilized as a primary source of capital 
when these debt instruments mature  the company may refinance such debt at then existing market interest rates  which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt 
if interest rates on the existing fixed rate debt outstanding at february   changed by basis points  the company s annual interest expense would change by million 
during fiscal  average borrowings under the company s variable rate revolving credit facilities and its short term financing of its proprietary accounts receivable were million 
if interest rates on the average fiscal variable rate debt changed by basis points  the company s annual interest expense would change by  assuming comparable borrowing levels
