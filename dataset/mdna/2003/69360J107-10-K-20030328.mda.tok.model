without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  seeks  estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements

overview critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  depreciation  accrual of operating expenses and accruals for contingencies each of which we discuss below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
of the securities and exchange commission  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized 
the criteria is that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts rental revenue from our tenants is our principal source of revenue 
we monitor the collectibility of our receivable balances including the deferred rent receivable on an on going basis 
based on these reviews  we establish a provision  and maintain an allowance  for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of our tenants to make required rent payments to us 
a provision for doubtful accounts is recorded during each period 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which represents the cumulative allowances less write offs of uncollectible rent  is netted against tenant and other receivables on our consolidated balance sheets 
if we incorrectly determine the collectibility of our revenue  the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be affected 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates its assets used in operations  by identifying indicators of impairment and by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for each asset to the asset s carrying amount 
our long lived assets consist primarily of our investments in real estate 
the fair value of our investments in real estate depends on the future cash flows from operations of the properties 
if the estimated future cash flow of the property results in a determination that the fair value is less than our carrying value  an impairment may be recognized if we determine the loss to be permanent 
as of december   the company does not consider any of its long lived assets to be impaired 
capitalization of real estate facilities real estate facilities are recorded at cost 
costs related to the renovation or improvement of the properties are capitalized 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
expenditures that are expected to benefit a period greater than months and exceed  are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life 
buildings and equipment are depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which are generally and years  respectively 
leasing costs in excess of  for leases with terms greater than two years are capitalized and depreciated amortized over their estimated useful lives 
leasing costs for leases of less than two years or less than  are expensed as incurred 
interest cost and property taxes incurred during the period of construction of real estate facilities are capitalized 
if these costs are not capitalized correctly  the timing of expenses and the recording of real estate assets could be over or understated 
depreciation we compute depreciation on our buildings and equipment using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of generally and years 
a significant portion of the acquisition cost of each property is allocated to building and building components usually 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to building and its components and the determination of the useful life are based on management s estimates 
if we do not allocate appropriately to building or related components or incorrectly estimate the useful life of our properties  the timing and or the amount of depreciation expense will be affected 
in addition  the net book value of real estate assets could be over or understated 
the statement of cash flows  however  would not be affected 
accruals of operating expenses the company accrues for property tax expenses  performance bonuses and other operating expenses each quarter based on historical trends and anticipated disbursements 
if these estimates are incorrect  the timing of expense recognition will be affected 
accruals for contingencies the company is exposed to business and legal liability risks with respect to events that may have occurred  but in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles has not accrued for such potential liabilities because the loss is either not probable or not estimable 
future events and the result of pending litigation could result in such potential losses becoming probable and estimable  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition of results of operations 
qualification as a reit income tax expense we believe that we have been organized and operated  and we intend to continue to operate  as a qualifying reit under the internal revenue code and applicable state laws 
a qualifying reit generally does not pay corporate level income taxes on its taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders  and accordingly  we do not pay or record as an expense income tax on the share of our taxable income that is distributed to shareholders 
given the complex nature of the reit qualification requirements  the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances  we cannot provide any assurance that we actually have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a reit for any particular taxable year 
for any taxable year that we fail or failed to qualify as a reit and applicable relief provisions did not apply  we would be taxed at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income  whether or not we made or make any distributions to our shareholders 
any resulting requirement to pay corporate income tax  including any applicable penalties or interest  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualifications was lost 
there can be no assurance that we would be entitled to any statutory relief 
effect of economic conditions on the company s operations during and  the company has been affected by the slowdown in economic activity in the united states in most of its primary markets 
these effects were exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of september  and the related aftermath 
these effects include a decline in occupancy rates  a reduction in market rental rates throughout the portfolio  increased rent concessions  tenant improvement allowances and lease commissions  slower than expected lease up of the company s development properties  increased tenant defaults and the termination of leases pursuant to early termination options 
the reduction in occupancies and market rental rates has been the result of several factors related to general economic conditions 
there are more businesses contracting than expanding  more businesses failing than starting up and general uncertainty for businesses  resulting in slower decision making and requests for shorter term leases 
there is also more competing vacant space  including substantial amounts of sub lease space  in many of the company s markets 
many of the company s properties have lower vacancy rates than the average rates for the markets in which they are located  consequently  the company may have difficulty in maintaining its occupancy rates as leases expire 
an extended economic slowdown will put additional downward pressure on occupancies and market rental rates 
the economic slowdown and the abundance of space alternatives available to customers has led to pressure for greater rent concessions  more generous tenant improvement allowances and higher broker commissions 
these economic conditions have also resulted in the erosion of tenant credit quality throughout the portfolio 
as a result  more tenants are contacting us regarding their economic viability  including those that could be material to our revenue base and more tenants are electing to terminate their leases early under lease termination options 
to a certain extent  these economic conditions have affected two large tenants representing a combined of the company s revenues 
leases with worldcom and two related entities generate of the company s revenues 
worldcom s recent bankruptcy may adversely affect the continuity of that revenue 
another large tenant representing approximately of revenues defaulted on its lease obligations in the third quarter of and has requested a modification of its lease 
this tenant is no longer in default on its lease obligations and the company is currently monitoring the status of this lease closely 
several other of our large tenants have contacted us  requesting early termination of their lease  rent reduction in space under lease  rent deferment or abatement 
at this time  the company cannot anticipate what impact  if any  the ultimate outcome of these discussions will have on our operating results 
the company s two development properties were leased in the aggregate as of december   but they have not been leased as rapidly as the company had anticipated 
the development properties consist of a  square foot flex development in northern virginia that was leased  and a  square foot development in the beaverton submarket of portland  oregon that was leased
