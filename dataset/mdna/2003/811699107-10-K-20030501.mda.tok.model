item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements  related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this annual report contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking information due to competitive factors and other factors discussed under certain risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of systems  known as video storage servers  that automate the management and distribution of long form video streams  such as movies or other feature presentations  and short form video streams  such as advertisements 
we have three reportable segments broadband systems  broadcast systems and services 
the broadband systems segment includes products  such as our digital advertising and video on demand products  that digitally manage  store and distribute digital video for cable system operators and telecommunications companies 
the broadcast systems segment includes products for the storage  archival  on air playback of advertising and other video programming for the broadcast television industry 
our system revenues are comprised of sales of our broadband and broadcast systems 
the service segment is comprised of revenue related to product development contracts  installation  training  product maintenance and technical support for all of the above systems  and delivery of content which is distributed by the broadband product segment 
we have experienced fluctuations in our systems revenues from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the receipt of customer orders and the shipment of those orders 
the factors that impact the timing of the receipt of customer orders include among other factors the customer s obtaining authorized signatures on their purchase orders  the budgetary approvals within the customer s company for capital purchases  and the ability to process the purchase order within the customer s organization in a timely manner 
factors that may impact the shipment of customer orders include the availability of material to produce the product  and the time required to produce and test the system before delivery 
because the average sales price of our system is approximately  the delay in the timing of receipt and shipment of any one customer order can result in significant fluctuations in our revenue reported on a quarterly basis 
our operating results are significantly influenced by a number of factors  including the mix of products sold and services provided  pricing  costs of materials used in our products and the expansion of our operations during the fiscal year 
we price our products and services based upon our costs as well as in consideration of the prices of competitive products and services in the marketplace 
the costs of our products primarily consist of the costs of components and subassemblies that have generally declined over time 
as a result of the growth of our business  our operating expenses have increased in the areas of research and development  selling and marketing  customer service and support and administration 
we expect that the soft economy will continue to adversely influence the capital spending budgets of some of our cable and broadcast customers who we believe depend on advertising revenues to fund their capital equipment purchases 
accordingly  we expect our financial results to vary from quarter to quarter and our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
on january   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  consisting of  shares sold by us and  shares sold by certain of our stockholders 
proceeds to seachange  net of underwriting discounts and costs of the offering  were approximately million 
on may   a jury rendered a verdict that we infringed patent no 
 that is held by ncube for which a complaint had been previously filed by ncube in january the jury also found that the infringement was willful 
in march  the court awarded damages of million related to the shipments of the accused vod systems through january  plus pre judgment interest of  in addition to reimbursement of certain ncube legal costs of million 
we recorded certain charges of million to reflect the unfavorable jury verdict in the first quarter of fiscal and subsequently reduced these charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reflect the court s rulings in march in october  we entered into a business development agreement with the on demand group limited odg  a company incorporated in england and wales  whereby odg agreed to exclusively purchase and to market and promote our video on demand systems worldwide in connection with furnishing video on demand services to odg s customers 
during the year ended january   there were no product sales to odg or any other affiliated entities 
as part of this relationship  we invested million in odg for  ordinary shares of odg and have committed additional funding as defined in the agreements between the two companies 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
a summary of those accounting policies that we believe are most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
revenues from sales of systems are recognized upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
installation  project management and training revenue is deferred and recognized as these services are performed 
revenue from technical support and maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the related agreements  generally one year 
customers are billed for installation  project management  training and maintenance at the time of the product sale 
if a portion of the sales price is not due until installation of the system is complete  that portion of the sales price is deferred until installation is complete 
revenue from movie content services is recognized based on the volume of monthly purchases that are made by hotel guests 
revenue from product development contract services is recognized based on the time and materials incurred to complete the work 
shipping and handling costs are included in revenue and cost of revenues 
our transactions frequently involve the sales of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
systems sales always include at least one year of free technical support and maintenance services 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated to all undelivered elements of the sales arrangement based upon the fair value of those elements 
the amounts allocated to training  project management  technical support and maintenance and movie content fees are based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately and unaccompanied by the other elements 
the amount allocated to installation revenue is based upon hourly rates and the estimated time required to complete the service 
the amount allocated to the sale of systems reflects the residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to the undelivered elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to systems revenue 
installation  training and project management services are not essential to the functionality of systems as these services do not alter the equipment s capabilities  are available from other vendors and the systems are standard products 
for transactions in which consideration  including equity instruments  is given to a customer  we account for the value of this consideration as a reduction in revenue in our statement of operations see further discussion under equity investments within management s discussion and analysis and footnote in the consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue for systems and services only in those situations where collection from the customer is reasonably assured 
our normal payments terms are of the order due upon receipt of a customer purchase order  due upon shipment of the product to the customer and due days after shipment of the product to the customer 
our finance management regularly monitors payments from our customers and assesses any collection issues 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customer s financial condition but generally do not require collateral from our customers 
for some of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
we maintain allowances for specific doubtful accounts based on estimates of losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and record these allowances as a charge to general and administrative expenses 
we base our estimates on our historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit assessment  and other analysis of specific customer situations 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
for example  during the year ended january   we recorded a  charge to operations relating to exposures on outstanding amounts owed to us from adelphia communications corp 
our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inventories and reserves for obsolescence 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of components  subassemblies and finished products held for sale 
all of our hardware components are purchased from outside vendors 
we depend upon certain vendors for the manufacture of significant components for all of our products 
if these vendors were to become unwilling or unable to manufacture these products in required volumes  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable alternative vendors 
the inability to develop alternative sources  if required in the future  could result in delays or reductions in product shipments and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our manufacturing  finance and operations personnel monitor quarterly the inventories to determine that the carrying value is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we record a provision for net realizable value adjustments  including obsolete inventory  when an impairment is identified through the quarterly management review process 
obsolete inventory  consisting of on hand components  subassemblies and finished products  is written down to its estimated net realizable value  if less than cost 
the obsolescence evaluation is based upon assumptions and estimates about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses and involves significant judgments 
for obsolete inventory that has been written down to its net realizable value  if there is a subsequent increase in demand for the same inventory at a higher value  we release the reserve upon sale or disposal of this inventory 
principles of consolidation 
we consolidate the balance sheets and results of operations of all wholly and majority owned subsidiaries 
we also hold minority investments in the capital stock of certain private companies having product offerings or customer relationships that are strategic to us 
these investments in affiliates include investments accounted for under the cost method and the equity method of accounting 
under the cost method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent less than a ownership interest of the equity shares of the affiliate  the investments are carried at cost and we monitor the investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in the carrying value  if necessary 
under the equity method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent to ownership of the equity securities of the affiliate  our proportionate ownership share of the earnings or losses of the affiliate is included in equity income loss in earnings of affiliates in our consolidated statement of operations 
for transactions involving the sale of our products and services to an affiliated entity in which we have an equity ownership interest  the extent of revenue and profit recognized varies based on the level of equity interest we hold 
when our equity ownership interest in the affiliated customer is less than  and we account for such interest on a cost basis  generally no revenue or profit is eliminated upon the sale of our products to an affiliated entity 
when our equity ownership interest is between and  provided that we do not control the affiliated entity  we generally recognize revenue upon shipment but we eliminate a portion of the profit equal to our equity ownership interest in the entity 
the profit is eliminated through a charge to equity loss in the earnings of affiliated entities with a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of the investment in the affiliate 
investments in affiliates 
on november   we entered into a joint development and marketing agreement with visible world 
the purpose of the partnership is to integrate the advertising insertion product offerings that we offer with the software technologies of visible world  which would enable advertisers an end to end solution for providing target advertising to their customers 
commencing on november   the agreement is terminable on days notice given by either party 
in conjunction with the arrangement  visible world issued us a fully vested warrant to purchase one million shares of series b preferred stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant expires at the earliest of a the consummation of a qualified public offering  as defined in the agreement  by visible world  b the sale of visible world  as defined in the warrant agreement and c years 
because the issuance of the warrant to us under the terms of the agreement is in exchange for services to be provided by us  the warrant is accounted for under the guidance of eitf  accounting by a grantee for an equity instrument to be received in conjunction with providing goods or services 
management determined the fair value of the warrant based on available financial information using the black scholes valuation model 
the assumptions used in this valuation included a fair value of visible world stock of per share  a weighted average volatility factor of  a dividend yield of  a risk free interest rate of  and an expected warrant term of years 
if management had used another valuation method or different valuation assumptions  the fair value of the warrant may have significantly changed 
we recorded the value of the warrant of  as a long term investment included in investments in affiliates with an offsetting amount included in deferred revenue 
we are recognizing the deferred revenue over a five year period  the expected term of the services 
in addition  we review the carrying value of our investment on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment of the asset 
as a result of this review  no adjustment to the carrying value was required 
it is possible that changes in facts or circumstances related to the value of this investment could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
on october   we entered into a subscription and shareholders agreement the subscription agreement with on demand group limited odg  a company incorporated in england and wales that provides video on demand services in europe 
pursuant to the subscription agreement  we invested million uk pounds sterling approximately million in exchange for  ordinary shares of odg representing approximately of the total outstanding capital stock of odg as of october  we recorded the value of our investment in investments in affiliates 
in connection with this subscription agreement  we entered into a business development agreement with odg for a minimum period of five years whereby odg agreed to exclusively purchase and to market and promote our video on demand systems and software worldwide in connection with furnishing video on demand services to odg s customers 
the realization of our investments in equity securities may be affected by the affiliate s ability to obtain adequate funding and execute its business plans  general market conditions  industry considerations specific to the affiliate s business  and other factors 
the inability of an affiliate to obtain future funding or successfully execute its business plan could adversely affect our equity earnings of the affiliate in the periods affected by those events 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the affiliates could result in equity losses or in inability to recover the carrying value of the investments in affiliates that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
valuation of long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards board no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which we adopted on february   the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internal and external  that may suggest an asset is not recoverable that is  the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset s use and eventual disposition 
factors we consider important that could trigger the impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decrease in the market value of the long lived asset  significant adverse change to the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  significant decline in our technological value as compared to the market  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if such circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of the assets on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
in determining expected future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
our cash flow estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
net intangible assets consist of capitalized patent defense costs of million which are being amortized to general and administrative expenses over their four year estimated useful life 
in connection with the ncube patent infringement jury verdict in may see legal proceedings  we wrote off million of certain deferred legal costs that had become impaired 
equity investments 
on december   we and comcast cable communications  inc comcast entered into a video on demand purchase agreement for our video on demand servers and related services 
under the terms of the video on demand purchase agreement  comcast committed to purchase our systems capable of serving a minimum of one million cable subscribers by approximately december in addition  comcast may earn up to an additional  incentive common stock purchase warrants through december based on the number of cable subscribers in excess of one million who are served by our systems which has been purchased by comcast 
on february   we and comcast sc signed and closed a common stock and warrant purchase agreement 
under the terms of this agreement  we sold in a private placement to comcast sc for approximately million an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share 
we determined the intrinsic value of  related to the  shares of common stock purchased on february  and measured the fair value of million related to the  common stock purchase warrants as of the closing date and recorded these amounts as contra equity 
on april   we recorded an additional contra equity amount of  for the fair value of the additional  common stock purchase warrants of our common stock as the registration statement had not been declared effective on or before march  in accordance with the agreement 
on june   the effective date of the registration statement  we issued an additional  common stock purchase warrants in accordance with the agreement  and recorded an additional contra equity amount of  representing the incremental fair value of the total warrants issued 
management determined the fair value of the warrants using the black scholes valuation model 
the assumptions used in this valuation included a weighted average volatility factor of  a dividend yield of  a risk free interest rate of  and an expected warrant term of years 
if management had used another valuation method or different valuation assumptions  the fair value of the warrants may have significantly changed  which could have materially impacted our results of operations 
the total contra equity amount of million was amortized as an offset to gross revenue in proportion to the revenue recognized from the sale of equipment with respect to the first one million subscribers comcast has committed to under the video on demand purchase agreement 
we had originally estimated that the equipment value with respect to the first one million subscribers to be million and in april we revised this estimate to million based on price decreases within the video on demand equipment market 
in may  we issued comcast  incentive common stock purchase warrants based on the number of cable subscribers in excess of the first one million subscribers that will be served by our equipment 
the exercise price of the incentive common stock purchase warrants of was based on the average closing market price of our common stock for the fifteen trading days ending on the agreed upon determination date of april  we recorded a contra equity amount of  representing the fair value of the additional incentive common stock purchase warrants issued 
during the three months ended july   we amortized the  of the deferred equity discount as an offset to gross revenue because the warrants were earned by comcast 
in august  we issued comcast an additional incentive common stock purchase warrants based on the number of cable subscribers in excess of the first one million subscribers that will be served by our equipment 
the exercise price of the incentive common stock purchase warrants of was based on the average closing market price of our common stock for the fifteen trading days ending on the determination date of june  we recorded  as an offset to gross product revenue representing the fair value of the additional incentive common stock purchase warrants issued 
in addition  during the period august  through december   we recorded  as an offset to gross product revenue representing the estimated fair value of  additional incentive common stock purchase warrants  based on the number of cable subscribers in excess of the first one million subscribers  earned by comcast as of december  the estimated fair value of the common stock purchase warrants was based on the average closing market price of our common stock for the fifteen trading days ending on december  during the month ended january   we recorded  as an offset to gross product revenue representing the estimated fair value of  additional incentive common stock purchase warrants  based on the number of cable subscribers in excess of the first one million subscribers  earned by comcast as of january  the estimated fair value of the common stock purchase warrants was based on the average closing market price of our common stock for the last fifteen trading days ended on january  accounting for income taxes 
we record income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
our financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses  as well as other temporary differences between financial and tax accounting 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance if the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets is reduced based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence 
significant management judgment is required in determining our income tax expense benefit  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
as a result of the cumulative taxable losses over recent fiscal years  including the significant loss incurred in fiscal  mainly as the result of the charge to operations recorded in the first quarter of fiscal related to the unfavorable jury verdict in the ncube litigation  we had determined that our deferred tax assets as of april  would not be realizable for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  we have recorded income tax expense of million as a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets as of that date 
in addition  we have not recorded any income tax benefit for the operating losses generated during fiscal the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future events  including generating taxable income in future periods 
we will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence 
if we generate future taxable income against which these tax attributes may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and a corresponding increase in net income would be reported in the future 
accounting for contingencies 
during the quarter ended april   we recorded a million charge to operations in connection with the unfavorable jury verdict received against us related to the patent infringement claim filed by ncube corp 
on january  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  and related guidance  we determined that based upon the unfavorable jury verdict stating that our infringement was willful  we determined that it was probable that certain deferred legal costs previously incurred in connection with defending an existing patent had become impaired and that liabilities for damages  treble damages  legal fees  including estimated ncube legal fees  and related accrued interest had been incurred as of april  in response to post trial motions filed by seachange and ncube in  the court issued on march  two orders in the patent infringement case 
as part of the court order  the court awarded ncube enhanced damages of two times the jury award  two thirds of its attorney s fees  and pre judgment and post judgment interest 
in addition  on april   ncube submitted to the court a post judgment calculation of damages which applies the royalty rate to the sales of the allegedly infringing video on demand products during the months of february  march  april and may of and which includes post judgment interest through april  based on the court order issued on march  and the subsequent court filing by ncube on april   we adjusted our accrued litigation reserve in the fourth quarter of fiscal by reducing the estimated damages by million  the estimated ncube legal costs by  and the pre judgment and post judgment interest charges by  the legal expenses paid through january  of million includes million of our deferred legal expense included in other assets as of january   which was expensed in the first quarter of  as well as our legal fees incurred in fiscal related to pre verdict legal services 
other than the payment of our legal fees  any payment of the other amounts recorded as one time charges will only occur in the event that the jury verdict is upheld in appeal and the enhanced damages are awarded 
we believe that any liability ultimately incurred after pursuing all legal options will not likely exceed the provision  as adjusted in the fourth quarter  recorded during the year ended january  except for the on going legal fees associated with the dispute and additional interest on the awarded damages which will be charged to operations 
however  we have revised our estimate of ongoing legal expenses and interest on the potential damages award in aggregate to be approximately  to  per fiscal quarter until the matter is resolved 
for the year ended january   approximately million in legal fees and accrued interest on the potential damages award related to this litigation were recorded as general and administrative expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital or incurring debt 
other than our equity investment in odg see liquidity and capital resources  we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
year ended january  compared to the year ended january  systems revenues 
our systems revenues consist of sales of our broadband and broadcast products 
systems revenues increased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  revenues from the broadband segment  which accounted for of total revenues in the year ended january  and of total revenues in the year ended january   increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal digital advertising system revenues were million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended january  video on demand revenues increased to million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended january  video on demand revenue for the years ended january  and were reduced by the amortization of and million  respectively  related to the deferred equity discount associated with the comcast equity investment 
the increase in broadband revenues is primarily attributable to the increased deployment of residential video on demand systems in the united states for cable operators  offset in part by a decline in the number of expansion systems purchased by united states cable system operators for digital advertising 
broadcast system segment revenues were million in the year ended january  compared to million in the year ended january  the decrease in broadcast revenues for the year ended january  was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures by broadcast companies that we believe reflects declining advertising revenues earned by those companies 
we expect future revenue growth  if any  to come principally from our interactive television and broadcast system products as cable and telecommunications companies continue to offer new video on demand applications for their customers and the market for digital video servers within the broadcast industry continues to expand 
we do not expect the business development agreement with odg to have a significant impact on our video on demand revenues until late fiscal or fiscal as revenues from broadcast and interactive television products increase  the digital advertising products will become a smaller portion of total system revenues 
however  we believe that there will be a continuing demand for expansions to existing digital advertising insertion systems within the united states 
services revenues 
our services revenues consist of fees for installation  training  project management  product maintenance  technical support services  product development contracts and movie content fees 
our services revenues increased to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  this increase in services revenues primarily resulted from the annual renewals of technical support and maintenance service contracts  price increases on certain technical support and maintenance services and the impact of a growing installed base of systems 
for the twelve month periods ended january  and january   certain customers each accounted for more than of our total revenues 
single customers each accounted for  and of total revenues in the year ended january  and and of total revenues in the year ended january  revenue from these customers was primarily in the broadband segment 
we believe that a significant amount of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of large customers 
international sales accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the twelve month periods ended january  and january   respectively 
no individual country accounted for more than of total revenue 
we expect that international sales will remain a significant portion of our business in the future 
as of january   substantially all sales of our products were made in united states dollars 
therefore  we have not experienced  nor do we expect to experience in the near term  any material impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations or liquidity 
if this practice changes in the future  we will reevaluate our foreign currency exchange rate risk 
systems gross profit 
costs of systems revenues consist primarily of the cost of purchased components and subassemblies  labor and overhead relating to the final assembly and testing of complete systems and related expenses 
costs of systems revenues increased to million in the year ended january  as compared to million in the year ended january  in the year ended january   the increase in costs of systems revenues reflects higher systems revenue and relatively higher material costs within the video on demand products 
we expect cost of systems revenues for the video on demand products within the broadband segment to decrease as a percentage of revenues as the revenue level increases and we improve our manufacturing and material purchasing efficiencies 
systems gross profit as a percentage of systems revenues was and in the year ended january  and january   respectively 
the decrease in systems gross profit in the year ended january  was primarily due to the shift within the broadband segment from product sales of higher gross profit ad insertion systems to lower gross profit video on demand systems 
we expect this product sales shift to continue  however  we expect that gross profit for video on demand systems will improve as the revenue level for video on demand systems increases and we improve our manufacturing and purchasing efficiencies 
gross profit for the broadband segment decreased from of revenues for the year ended january  to of revenues for the year ended january  and gross profit for the broadcast segment decreased from to for the year ended january  and the year ended january   respectively 
services gross profit 
costs of services revenues consist primarily of labor  materials and overhead relating to the installation  training  product maintenance and technical support services provided by us and costs associated with providing movie content services 
costs of services revenues increased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january   primarily as a result of increased revenues and the costs associated with our hiring and training additional service personnel to provide worldwide support for the growing installed base of broadband and broadcast systems and costs associated with providing movie content 
services gross profit as a percentage of services revenue was in the year ended january  and in the year ended january  improvements in the services gross profit in the year ended january  reflect the economies of scale resulting from the increase in the installed base of systems under maintenance service contracts and price increases on certain annual technical support and maintenance services 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of the compensation of development personnel  depreciation of development and test equipment and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
research and development expenses increased from approximately million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  the increase in the dollar amount was primarily attributable to the hiring and contracting of additional development personnel which reflects our continuing investment in new products  prototype expenses associated with these development efforts and outside fees related to the certification of our products 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase to in the fiscal year as we continue our development and support of new and existing products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses  including sales commissions  travel expenses and certain promotional expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  this increase is primarily due to increased sales commissions on higher revenues  higher travel costs related to increased direct sales efforts  and higher marketing expenses specifically for tradeshow and other promotional activities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the provision for litigation and related expenses resulting from the ncube jury verdict  compensation of executive  finance  human resource and administrative personnel  legal and accounting services and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended january  increased million over the year ended january  this increase is primarily due to the recording of charges of million in fiscal associated with an unfavorable jury verdict in connection with the litigation with ncube  an additional million in on going legal fees and accrued interest related to the above litigation and the increase in accounts receivable reserves  principally a  provision against outstanding amounts owed by adelphia communications corp  which filed for bankruptcy in june we have estimated that our ongoing legal expenses based on legal expenses incurred in each of the last three fiscal quarters and we expect to incur on going legal fees and accrued interest on awarded potential damages in the aggregate amount of approximately  to  per fiscal quarter until the matter is resolved 
the charges recorded for the ncube jury verdict totaled million and included provisions for estimated damages and enhanced damages relating to the shipments of the accused video on demand vod systems through april   legal expenses  including estimated ncube legal fees and million of our legal costs that had been included in other assets as of january   and accrued interest on total damages 
the legal expenses paid through january  of million includes the write off of million of seachange deferred legal fees included in other assets as of january  and fees of million incurred during fiscal related to pre verdict legal services 
the following is a summary of the accrued litigation reserve through january estimated damages on the accused vod shipments through april  estimated treble damages on the accused vod shipments through april  estimated legal fees including write off of capitalized legal costs and ncube legal fees accrued interest on estimated damages and treble damages through april  total charges recorded as of april  additional accrued interest on estimated damages and treble damages through january  adjustment to litigation reserve based on march  court order and april  court filing legal expenses paid through january  accrued litigation reserve as of january  this reserve reflects our best estimate of our exposure based on information currently available 
however  we believe that any liability ultimately incurred after pursuing all legal options will not likely exceed the provision  as adjusted in the fourth quarter  except for on going legal fees associated with the dispute and additional interest on the awarded damages  which will be charged to operations 
other than the payment of our legal fees  any payment of the other amounts recorded as charges will only occur in the event that the jury verdict is upheld in appeal 
we plan to contest the verdict  the claim construction and the denial of any of its post trial motions by appeal to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
any injunctive relief against us will not be determined until after appeal 
in the event that the court issues an injunction prohibiting us from selling the accused video on demand products  we believe that such injunction would have a minimal impact on our ability to ship products and meet customer demands because we have implemented a revised version of the software which we believe does not infringe the ncube patent 
interest income expense  net 
interest expense  net  was approximately  in the year ended january  and interest income  net  was approximately million in the year ended january  the increase in interest income expense primarily reflects invested cash balances resulting from our public stock offering which closed on january   offset in part by interest paid on borrowings 
income tax expense benefit 
as a result of the cumulative taxable losses over recent fiscal years  including the significant loss incurred in fiscal  mainly as the result of the charge to operations recorded in the first quarter of fiscal related to the unfavorable jury verdict in the ncube litigation  we had determined that our deferred tax assets as of april  will not be realized for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  we have recorded income tax expense of million  as a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets as of that date 
in addition  we have not recorded any income tax benefit for the operating losses generated during fiscal we will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence  including generating sufficient pre tax book income in future periods 
our effective tax rate was and for the year ended january  and january   respectively 
the change in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was largely due to the income tax expense recorded as a valuation allowance in the first quarter of fiscal year ended january  compared to the year ended january  systems revenues 
systems revenues increased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  revenues from the broadband segment  which accounted for of total revenues in the year ended january  and of total revenues in the year ended january   increased from million in to million in digital advertising system revenues were million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended january  interactive television systems revenues increased to million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended january  reducing interactive television systems revenue for the year ended january  was the amortization of million related to the deferred equity discount associated with the comcast equity investment 
the increase in broadband revenues is primarily attributable to the initial deployment of residential video on demand systems in the united states for cable operators  offset in part by a decline in the number of expansion systems purchased by united states cable system operators for digital advertising 
broadcast system segment revenues were million in the year ended january  compared to million in the year ended january  the decrease in broadcast revenues for the year ended january  was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures by broadcast companies that we believe is tied to declining advertising revenues earned by those companies 
services revenues 
our services revenues increased to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  this increase in services revenues primarily resulted from the renewals of technical support and maintenance services  price increases on certain technical support and maintenance services  the impact of a growing installed base of systems and a higher level of product development services 
for the twelve month periods ended january  and january   certain customers each accounted for more than of our total revenues 
single customers each accounted for and of total revenues in the year ended january  and  and of total revenues in the year ended january  revenue from these customers was primarily in the broadband segment 
international sales accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the twelve month periods ended january  and january   respectively 
we expect that international sales will remain a significant portion of our business in the future 
as of january   substantially all sales of our products were made in united states dollars 
therefore  we have not experienced any material impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations or liquidity 
systems gross profit 
costs of systems revenues increased to million in the year ended january  as compared to million in the year ended january  in the year ended january   the increase in costs of systems revenues reflects higher systems revenue and higher material costs within the interactive television products 
systems gross profit as a percentage of systems revenues was and in the year ended january  and january   respectively 
the decrease in systems gross profit in the year ended january  was primarily due to the shift within the broadband segment from product sales of higher gross profit ad insertion systems to lower gross profit interactive television systems 
gross profit for the broadband segment decreased from for the year ended january  to for the year ended january  while gross profit for the broadcast segment decreased from to for the year ended january  and the year ended january   respectively 
services gross profit 
costs of services revenues increased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january   primarily as a result of increased revenues and the costs associated with our hiring and training additional service personnel to provide worldwide support for the growing installed base of broadband and broadcast systems and costs associated with providing movie content 
services gross profit as a percentage of services revenue was in the year ended january  and in the year ended january  improvements in the services gross profit in the year ended january  reflect the increase in the installed base of systems under maintenance  price increases on certain annual technical support and maintenance services and higher product development revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from approximately million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  the increase in the dollar amount was primarily attributable to the hiring and contracting of additional development personnel which reflects our continuing investment in new products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  this increase is primarily due to the hiring of additional sales personnel for our broadcast and interactive television products  increased sales commissions on higher revenues and higher marketing expenses specifically for tradeshow and other promotional activities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses remained flat at million in the year ended january  and january   respectively 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  was approximately  in the year ended january  and interest expense  net  was approximately  in the year ended january  the increase in in interest expense  net  primarily resulted from interest expense on increased borrowings under our lines of credit and borrowings under our construction loan 
income tax expense benefit 
our effective tax benefit rate was in the year ended january  the effective tax rate for the year ended january  was favorably impacted by the utilization of research and development tax credits 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
during the fourth quarter of the year ended january   we implemented the sec s sab guidelines  retroactive to the beginning of the year 
this was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of february  historically  for some of our sales transactions  a portion of the sales price  typically  was not due until installation occurred 
we now defer revenue recognition on the portion of the sales price not due until installation is complete 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on prior years resulted in a charge to income of million net of income taxes of  or per diluted share which has been included in income for the nine months ended october  quarterly results of operations the following tables present certain unaudited quarterly information for the quarterly periods in the years ended january  and january  the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results  and we believe that period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
three months ended april  july  october  january  april  july  october  january  in thousands  except per share amounts revenue gross profit operating expenses net income loss earnings loss per share basic and diluted we have experienced significant variations in revenues  expenses and operating results from quarter to quarter and such variations are likely to continue 
a significant portion of our revenues have been generated from a limited number of customers  and it is difficult to predict the timing of future orders and shipments to these and other customers 
customers can cancel or reschedule shipments  and development or production difficulties could delay shipments 
during the quarterly periods outlined above  we experienced variations in our revenues from quarter to quarter primarily related to the significant growth of our video on demand products in the broadband segment 
we have also experienced significant variations in our quarterly systems gross margins 
changes in pricing policies  the product mix  the timing and significance of new product introductions and product enhancements  and fluctuations in the number of systems affects manufacturing efficiencies and  accordingly  gross profits 
quarterly services gross margins have historically fluctuated significantly because installation and training service revenue varies by quarter while the related costs are relatively consistent by quarter 
operating expenses also vary with the number  timing and significance of new product and product enhancement introductions by us and our competitors  increased competition  the gain or loss of significant customers  the hiring of new personnel and general economic conditions 
during the quarterly periods outlined above  we experienced certain fluctuations in our operating expenses 
our selling and marketing costs fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of large tradeshows that take place in the first and third quarter of the year and significant promotional costs that are incurred for new product introductions 
our general and administrative expenses were significantly impacted by the unfavorable jury verdict in the ncube patent infringement litigation and on going legal costs associated with this litigation 
all of the above factors are difficult for us to forecast  and these or other factors may have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
only a small portion of our expenses vary with revenues in the short term and there would likely be a material adverse effect on our operating results if future revenues are lower than expectations 
based upon all of the forgoing  we believe that quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and  therefore  should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily with the proceeds of our common stock  borrowings and cash flows generated from operations 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million from million at january  to million at january  largely due to investing million in available for sale marketable securities in fiscal year working capital  excluding long term marketable securities decreased from approximately million at january  to approximately million at january  net cash provided from operating activities for the year ended january  and january  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended january  was the result of the net loss adjusted for non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization of million and the changes in certain operating assets and liabilities 
the significant changes in assets and liabilities that provided cash from operations included a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately million and an increase in the accrued litigation reserve of million related to the ncube litigation 
these items that generated cash from operations were offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million and a decrease in customer deposits of million 
we expect that the broadcast segment and the video on demand products within the broadband segment will continue to require a significant amount of cash to fund future product development  to manufacture and deploy customer test and demonstration equipment and to meet higher forecasted revenue levels 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million and million for the year ended january  and january   respectively 
investment activity consisted primarily of purchases of available for sale marketable securities of million  capital expenditures of million and the initial equity investment in odg of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended january  and cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended january  in the year ended january   the cash used in financing activities included approximately million in principal payments under our equipment line of credit and capital lease obligations partially offset by proceeds from stock issuance of million 
in october  we entered into a million revolving line of credit with a bank that expires in october loans made under this revolving line of credit will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the bank s prime rate  at january  as of january   we had no borrowings under this revolving line of credit 
borrowings under this line of credit are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
the loan agreement requires that we provide the bank with certain periodic financial reports and comply with certain financial ratios including a minimum level of earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization on a trailing twelve month basis 
as of january   these financial covenants were amended and we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
the line of credit replaces our prior revolving line of credit and equipment line with a different bank 
in conjunction with entering into the new bank line  we repaid to our prior lender all outstanding borrowings under the equipment line of credit in an amount of million 
in march  we repaid the outstanding balance under the current line of credit of million plus accrued interest to the bank 
in october  we entered into an agreement with a bank to finance million of the construction costs related to the purchase and renovation of a manufacturing mill in new hampshire that we previously purchased in february during the construction period  interest accrued and was paid at a per annum rate of 
upon occupancy of the building in november  the loan converted into two promissory notes whereby we pay principal and interest based upon a fixed interest rate per annum over a five and ten year period  respectively  of at january  borrowings under the loan are secured by the land and buildings of the renovated mill 
the loan agreement requires that we provide the bank with certain periodic financial reports and comply with certain annual financial ratios 
we were not in compliance with the financial covenants as of january  and we received a waiver from the bank for the violation 
as of january   borrowings outstanding under the loan were  it is typical for us to experience fluctuations in our monthly operating results primarily due to the timing of receiving customer orders and the related shipment of these customer orders 
as a result of these monthly fluctuations  we may experience an increase in our inventories as a result of procurement of both short and long lead components for anticipated orders for both our product segments  a decrease in our accounts payable balance primarily due to the timing of payments for materials purchased for prior month shipments  a decrease in accounts receivable amounts as a result of customer payments without corresponding customer shipments and a resulting decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
as part of the subscription and shareholders agreement the subscription agreement that we entered into with the on demand group limited odg on october   we have committed to purchase in two separate tranches  additional ordinary shares and preference shares of odg from odg and certain of its existing shareholders for an additional aggregate purchase price of up to million uk pounds sterling approximately million subject to odg s satisfaction of certain conditions as set forth in the subscription agreement 
preference shares of odg are non voting equity shares that have certain rights and restrictions as outlined in odg s articles of association  including but not limited to annual dividends  liquidation preferences and redemption repurchase rights 
in the first tranche  we have a commitment to purchase an additional  ordinary shares of odg for an aggregate purchase price of  uk pounds sterling  and an additional  ordinary shares of odg from certain existing shareholders of odg for an aggregate purchase price of million uk pounds sterling  subject to odg s satisfaction of the conditions as set forth in the subscription agreement for the first investment tranche  including the execution of an agreement by odg with a major european cable operator for the supply of video on demand products and services to the customers of such european cable operator on or prior to may  in the second tranche  we have a commitment to purchase an additional  ordinary shares of odg for an aggregate purchase price of  uk pounds sterling  and an additional  preference shares of odg for an aggregate purchase price of  uk pounds sterling  subject to odg s satisfaction of the conditions as set forth in the subscription agreement for the second investment tranche  including the satisfaction of all of the conditions for the first tranche and the execution of certain content provision agreements by odg with at least three studios providing for the supply of content for video on demand service on or prior to december  in the event of the expiration or the termination  for any reason other than breach of contract  of the business development agreement  odg  upon written notification from us  shall procure the sale or redemption of all the shares held by us at a price equal to the then current fair value for the ordinary shares and the redemption value of the preference shares as defined in the articles of association 
in january  we repurchased all of the outstanding common shares and unexercised common stock options of seachange systems  inc systems  a majority owned subsidiary 
as a result of this transaction  systems is now a wholly owned subsidiary and the holders of a total of  systems common shares and  systems common stock options ceased to be the holders of such securities and became entitled to receive  shares of our common stock  
par value per share 
we expect to issue the  shares of common stock in the first half of fiscal this repurchase has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the assets acquired consist of completed technology relating to the our broadband and broadcast products 
the aggregate consideration was approximately  of which  was allocated to intangible assets and the remaining consideration of  related to the exchange of systems common stock options for our common stock  was charged to compensation expense 
the following table reflects our current and contingent contractual obligations to make potential future payments fiscal year ending january  non cancelable lease commitments odg construction loan inventory total beyond total we believe that existing funds together with available borrowings under the revolving line of credit and the proceeds from our public stock offering completed in january are adequate to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and other contractual obligations for the foreseeable future 
effects of inflation our management believes that financial results have not been significantly impacted by inflation and price changes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposure has been related to local currency revenue and operating expenses in europe and asia 
historically  we have not hedged specific currency exposures as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions have not been material to date 
at january  and january   we had approximately million and  outstanding related to variable rate us dollar denominated debt 
the carrying value of these short term borrowings approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the interest rate  interest expense on these short term borrowings would increase by approximately  for the twelve month period ended january  and  for the twelve month period ended january  the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables and trade payables approximate fair value at january  due to the short maturities of these instruments 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities 
our cash and marketable securities include cash equivalents  which we consider to be investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at january   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
as a result  we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
at january   we had million in short term marketable securities and million in long term marketable securities 
the major portion of these securities have fixed interest rates and are not subject to risk arising from interest rate variability
