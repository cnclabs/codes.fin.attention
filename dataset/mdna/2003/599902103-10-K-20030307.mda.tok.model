also  words such as believe  anticipate  plan  expect  will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements as a result of various important factors  including  without limitation  those factors discussed in this annual report under the heading risk factors that may affect results 
overview we are a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products in several disease areas 
we currently have a cardiovascular disease product on the market and a cancer product under review for marketing approval 
we also have potential products in earlier stages of development in each of those areas and in our inflammatory disease and metabolic disease areas 
our strategy is to advance multiple products in several focus areas through clinical trials and regulatory approvals and to be involved in the marketing and sale of many of these products 
we plan to develop and commercialize many of our products on our own  but will seek development and commercial partners when we believe that to do so will maximize product value 
for example  we plan to enter into sales and marketing alliances with major pharmaceutical companies for products in disease areas that require large sales forces or to address markets outside the united states 
in particular  we are seeking a strategic arrangement relating to the sales and marketing of velcade bortezomib for injection 
as we continue to market integrilin eptifibatide injection  develop our product pipeline  commercialize additional products and enter into new commercial alliances  we expect to continue our shift from a discovery focused company towards a product based company 
commercialized product and product candidate integrilin integrilin  a market leading cardiovascular product  has been marketed in the united states since and outside the united states since we acquired integrilin as part of our february acquisition of cor therapeutics  inc  or cor 
in collaboration with schering plough ltd 
and schering plough corporation  together referred to as sgp  integrilin is being marketed in the united states  in all member states of the european union and in other countries  including argentina  australia  brazil  canada  india  japan  mexico  singapore  south africa  switzerland and thailand 
integrilin is approved for marketing in the united states for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes and for use at the time of a balloon angioplasty procedure 
this is a broader set of indications than the other two gp iib iiia inhibitors approved for marketing in the united states 
we believe that integrilin sales for its current indications will continue to increase if early usage in patients with acute coronary syndromes becomes more common and if the number of hospitals using integrilin increases 
we are also pursuing opportunities to expand the market potential for integrilin by increasing the approved therapeutic uses for this product 
velcade bortezomib for injection our product candidate  velcade  is the most advanced of our drug candidates in clinical development 
we completed our filing of a new drug application  or nda  with the united states food and drug administration  or fda  covering velcade in january in february  we submitted a complete marketing authorisation application  or maa  to the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products  or emea  for the approval of velcade 
if these applications are approved  we plan to market velcade as a treatment for patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma  a form of bone marrow cancer 
revenues historically  we have derived our revenue from payments from our strategic alliances with major pharmaceutical companies 
with the acquisition of cor  we began generating revenue based on sales of integrilin eptifibatide injection 
we expect that our revenue mix will continue to shift to product based revenue as we develop our product pipeline  commercialize additional products and enter into new commercial alliances  and our discovery focused alliances conclude 
integrilin revenue beginning in the first quarter of we began recognizing copromotion revenue that principally relates to our share of the profits from the sale of integrilin by sgp in copromotion territories under our collaboration agreement with sgp to jointly develop and commercialize integrilin on a worldwide basis 
copromotion revenues also include recognition of reimbursement from sgp of our cost of copromotion revenue and royalties from sgp on sales of integrilin outside the copromotion territory 
revenue from strategic alliances we have entered into research  development  technology transfer and commercialization arrangements with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies relating to a broad range of therapeutic and predictive medicine products and services 
these alliances provide us with the opportunity to receive various combinations of equity investments  license fees and research funding  and may provide certain additional payments contingent upon our achievement of research and regulatory milestones and royalties and or share profits if our collaborations are successful in developing and commercializing products 
these alliances are usually established for a fixed term  typically five years 
upon expiration of the initial term  unless renewed  revenue funding under these agreements ceases 
we expect revenues from our discovery focused alliances to decline as existing alliances expire 
in addition to our collaboration agreement with sgp  our major alliances from which we have or may recognize revenues include a march joint development and commercialization agreement with abbott laboratories  or abbott  in metabolic diseases  a june technology transfer agreement and joint development and commercialization agreement with aventis pharmaceuticals  inc  or aventis  in inflammatory disease  and a september research agreement with bayer ag  or bayer  in cardiovascular disease  and specified areas of oncology  pain  hematology  atherosclerosis  thrombosis  urology and viral infections 
in  our research alliance and technology transfer agreement with monsanto company  or monsanto  expired at the end of its original five year term 
we may receive royalty payments in the future if lead targets identified during the term of the alliance are further developed by monsanto into commercial products 
in  the research phase of our five year alliance with bayer could terminate  although bayer has an option for an additional year 
additionally  our technology transfer alliance with aventis may end as early as july we expect bayer to continue to conduct research and development work on the targets discovered in the alliance  which may result in success payments and royalties to us in the future 
we expect the joint development and commercialization agreement with aventis in the field of inflammatory disease to continue through we have also entered into a number of arrangements for the commercialization of products under which we share the costs for the development and eventual commercialization of specified compounds and may receive or be obligated to make product revenue  royalty  milestone or other payments 
in addition to operating expenses we incur as a result of our alliances  we have also made commitments to purchase debt and or equity securities under certain arrangements 
these arrangements include a december in license and development agreement with xenova group  plc for novel compounds for the treatment of solid tumors in cancer  a november collaboration agreement with xoma ltd  or xoma  pursuant to which xoma is developing two biotherapeutic agents in the cardiovascular disease area  and an april joint development agreement with bzl biologics  llc for chemotherapeutic agent conjugated and radiolabeled biotherapeutics products in the cancer area 
acquisitions as part of our business strategy  we consider joint development  merger and acquisition opportunities that may provide us with products on the market  products in later stage development or capabilities to accelerate our downstream drug discovery efforts 
cor on february   we acquired cor for an aggregate purchase price of billion through the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
this calculation is based on cor outstanding common stock at february  using the conversion ratio of of a share of our common stock for each share of outstanding cor common stock 
in addition  options to purchase approximately million shares of cor common stock were assumed by us and converted into options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock 
we recorded the transaction as a purchase for accounting purposes and our consolidated financial statements include cor s operating results from the date of the acquisition 
the purchase price was allocated  based upon an independent valuation  to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values  with the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of net tangible assets acquired allocated to in process research and development  developed technology  trademark and goodwill 
the charge to earnings for acquired in process research and development was million 
through the merger  we added approximately new employees and a leased facility in south san francisco  california  and acquired integrilin eptifibatide injection for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and substantial research capabilities in the areas of cardiovascular disease and oncology 
in connection with the cor acquisition  we assumed cor s million in convertible debt resulting from two offerings the convertible subordinated notes due march  the notes and the convertible senior notes due june  the notes 
in april  we amended the terms of these notes to add put options permitting noteholders to require us on april   to repurchase the notes for cash at a price of  per  of principal amount and the notes for cash at a price of  per  of principal amount  resulting in a maximum aggregate payment obligation of million 
these put options on the notes are derivative instruments 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires us to record all derivative instruments in the balance sheet at fair value 
we determined the fair value of these derivative instruments to be million in the aggregate and recorded a liability on the balance sheet and a non cash charge in the quarter ended june changes in the fair value of these derivatives would be recognized in income 
cdc on july   we acquired cambridge discovery chemistry ltd  a subsidiary of oxford molecular group  plc  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
we recorded the transaction as a purchase for accounting purposes and accordingly  we allocated the purchase price to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values 
we allocated the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to specifically identified intangible assets and goodwill 
the acquisition did not result in an in process research and development charge 
disposition of investment in joint venture through our acquisition of leukosite  inc  or leukosite  we became a party to a joint venture partnership  millennium and ilex partners  lp  or m i  for development of campath alemtuzumab humanized monoclonal antibody 
under the terms of the partnership  we were required to fund fifty percent of m i s working capital requirements 
we accounted for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting 
on december   ilex acquired our equity interest in m i  which owns the campath product 
in exchange for our equity interest in m i  ilex paid us million on december  plus additional consideration contingent upon future sales of campath 
we earned million of such consideration in we are entitled to additional payments of million in each of and if sales of campath in the us meet specified thresholds 
in addition  we are entitled to additional payments from ilex if us sales of campath after exceed specified annual thresholds 
financial resources in order to fund our working capital and for other corporate purposes  we have completed several financings in the past several years 
the actual and planned uses of proceeds include funding our growth  developing products  including conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials  manufacturing and marketing products that are approved for commercial sale  acquiring businesses and products that expand or complement our business  and meeting our debt service obligations 
in october  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
in january  we completed a sale  pursuant to rule a of the securities act of  of million of convertible subordinated notes due january  the notes  which resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to maturity at a price equal to per share  subject to adjustment  unless previously repurchased or redeemed by us 
under the terms of the notes  we are required to make semi annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the notes on january and july of each year 
to date  all required interest payments have been made 
during we paid an aggregate of million and during we paid an aggregate of million in cash to certain holders of our notes in order to induce the conversion of their notes into our common stock 
these cash payments were expensed during and interest accrued through the date of conversion was charged to interest expense and was paid upon conversion 
the conversion in resulted in the retirement of million of outstanding principal of these notes  the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock and the reclassification of deferred debt issuance costs of million to additional paid in capital 
the conversion in resulted in the retirement of million of outstanding principal of these notes  the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock and the reclassification of deferred debt issuance costs of million to additional paid in capital 
at december   we had million of the notes outstanding 
during we received million from abbott for purchases of approximately million shares of our common stock under our equity investment agreement with abbott 
during we received million from abbott for purchases of approximately million shares of our common stock under this agreement 
during  we received million from aventis for purchases of approximately million shares of our common stock under our equity investment agreement with aventis 
during  we received million from aventis for purchases of approximately million shares of our common stock under this agreement 
as of december  we had approximately billion in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we primarily invest in high grade corporate bonds  asset backed and us government agency securities 
our objectives are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
we expect that income from these investments will decline as our cash and marketable securities balances decline and will fluctuate based upon market conditions 
we are expanding our commercial operations through internal growth and by utilizing the capabilities of our alliance partners 
as our discovery focused alliances expire  we are increasingly focusing our efforts on entering into commercial alliances 
we expect to continue to manage costs through workforce planning  facilities consolidation and product portfolio management 
as we continue to build development and commercialization capabilities  during we hired staff in critical functions  including commercial operations  strategic product development and clinical research and operations  as well as in other support areas 
we expect to incur increasing expenses and are likely to incur increasing operating losses for at least the next several years  primarily due to the expansion of our research and development programs and as a result of our efforts to advance acquired products or our own development programs to commercialization 
in particular  we anticipate significant expenditures related to the development  launch and commercialization of velcade bortezomib for injection and increasing our development capabilities for our clinical and pre clinical product candidates 
we expect to continue to pursue additional alliances and to consider joint development  merger  or acquisition opportunities that may provide us with access to products on the market or in later stages of commercial development 
our results of operations for any period may not be indicative of future results as our revenues and expenses may fluctuate from period to period or year to year 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  intangible assets and goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue in connection with our strategic alliances  we recognize revenue from non refundable  up front  license and milestone payments  not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the term of the research contract 
when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the contract  management estimates the period based upon other critical factors contained within the contract 
we continually review these estimates which could result in a change in the deferral period and might impact the timing and the amount of revenue recognized 
when payments are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation associated with the payment is completed 
performance obligations typically consist of significant milestones in the development life cycle of the related technology  such as initiation of clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies and approvals by regulatory agencies 
in addition  when appropriate  we recognize revenue from certain research payments based upon the level of research services performed during the period of the research contract 
in connection with our adoption of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  we began recognizing the research funding portion of our bayer alliance on a percentage of completion basis 
the percentage of completion is determined based upon the actual level of work performed during the period as compared to our estimate of the total work to be performed under the alliance 
we continually review these estimates and adjust as necessary  as experience develops or new information becomes known 
any adjustments to these estimates will impact the timing and the amount of revenue to be recognized 
we recognize copromotion revenue when sgp ships integrilin eptifibatide injection to wholesalers 
copromotion revenue includes our share of the profits from the sales of integrilin  reimbursements of our cost of copromotion revenue  and royalties from sgp on sales of integrilin outside the copromotion territory 
we communicate with our partner to calculate our share of the profits from the sales of integrilin on a monthly basis 
the calculation includes estimates of the amount of advertising and promotional expenses and other costs of copromotion incurred on a monthly basis 
we also communicate with our partner to estimate royalties earned on sales outside the copromotion territory 
adjustments to our estimates are based upon actual information that we receive subsequent to our reporting deadlines 
our estimates are adjusted on a monthly basis and historically have not been significant due to periodic communication with our partner 
significant adjustments in future reporting periods could impact the timing and the amount of revenue to be recognized 
inventory inventory represents bulk materials used in the production of integrilin eptifibatide injection and integrilin finished goods inventory on hand  valued at cost 
inventories are reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete status based on sales activity  both projected and historical 
our current sales projections provide for full utilization of the inventory balance 
if product sales levels differ from projections  inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment  at which point we would record a reserve to adjust inventory to its net realizable value 
intangible assets we have acquired significant intangible assets that we value and record 
those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development  and those that are specifically identified and have alternative future uses are capitalized 
we use a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets acquired and for the assessment of impairment 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
we engage independent valuation experts who review our critical assumptions for significant acquisitions of intangibles 
we review intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis using an undiscounted net cash flows approach 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  the intangible asset is written down to the discounted cash flow value 
where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
goodwill we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective january  and reclassified amounts to goodwill  which were previously allocated to assembled workforce 
upon adoption  we ceased the amortization of goodwill 
we completed our transitional assessment of goodwill in the first quarter of and no impairment loss was recognized 
we will continue to test for goodwill impairment annually  on october on october   we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and determined that no impairment existed on that date 
however  since the date of acquisition of cor  which generated a significant amount of goodwill  we have experienced a significant decline in market capitalization due to a decline in stock price 
we continually monitor business and market conditions to assess whether an impairment indicator exists 
if we were to determine that an impairment indicator exists  we would be required to perform an impairment test which could result in a material impairment charge to our statement of operations 
accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and establishes that fair value is the objective measure for initial measurement of the liability 
we were required to adopt sfas no 
for activities that were initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
we adopted sfas no 
as of december  in association with the discontinuation of certain discovery efforts as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we adopted the new disclosure requirements of sfas no 
for the year ended december  as permitted  we will continue to apply the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees for stock based compensation 
results of operations years ended december  and december  amounts relating to the year ended december  the period do not include financial results for cor which we acquired on february  for the year ended december  the period  we reported a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share for the period 
revenue increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase in revenue primarily relates to the recognition of million of copromotion revenue in the period from worldwide sales of integrilin eptifibatide injection 
worldwide sales of integrilin in the period  as provided to us by sgp  were million  a percent increase over primarily as result of increased volume and also from price increases 
revenue under strategic alliances decreased from million in the period to million in the period 
strategic alliance revenue decreased due to decreased research efforts in our bayer alliance and termination of certain of our early strategic alliances  including our american home products alliance for the treatment and prevention of disorders of the central nervous system 
included in revenue is million of revenue that was recognized in prior years relating to the adoption of sab included in revenue is million of revenue that was recognized in prior years relating to the adoption of sab the remaining amount of revenue to be recognized in future years that was included in the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle is million  which will be recognized in research and development expenses increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the research and development expense categories with the most significant increases were personnel costs  followed by clinical trial costs and facilities expenses 
the increase was primarily attributable to our continued investment in building a sustainable product pipeline  with increases in clinical costs related to advancing our lead oncology program  velcade bortezomib for injection  and clinical investments made in integrilin 
as of december   excluding integrilin and velcade  we had nine product candidates in various stages of clinical trials  as discussed under our clinical pipeline in item completion of clinical trials may take several years or more and the length of time can vary substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
cmr international  an independent pharmaceutical data collection agency  estimates that clinical trials in our areas of focus are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase i years phase ii years phase iii years upon successful completion of phase iii trials  we intend to submit the results to the fda to support regulatory approval of the product 
however  we cannot be certain that any of our products will prove to be safe or effective  will receive regulatory approvals  or will be successfully commercialized 
our primary mechanism for budgeting and tracking these costs is by type of cost incurred rather than by project 
the types of costs include the following categories personnel costs  clinical costs  laboratory costs  technology license fees  research costs and facilities costs 
the duration and the cost relating to preclinical testing and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project 
our joint development arrangements with our strategic partners also result in variability in our development costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase was primarily attributable to the addition of the cor commercial infrastructure that was not present in the period as well as increased expenses due to the expansion of our business groups  facilities and infrastructure necessary to support the development of our pipeline and growth in all areas of our business 
significant increases were primarily in personnel expenses  followed by consulting and facilities expenses 
in december  we announced the first in a series of steps we will take to realign our resources to those of a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company 
we have discontinued certain discovery efforts  reduced related headcount and will reallocate certain resources to enhance our commercial capabilities 
as a result  we have recorded a restructuring charge of million in the period related to termination benefits  which include severance  out placement services and other associated costs 
we anticipate additional restructuring charges in in the range of million to million 
cost of copromotion revenue was million for the period and consists of certain manufacturing related and advertising and promotional expenses associated with the sale of integrilin eptifibatide within copromotion territories 
cost of copromotion revenue fluctuates in relation to the domestic sales of integrilin and based on the proportion of the joint activities that we undertake in our collaboration with sgp 
we recorded a one time  non cash charge to operations in the period of million for acquired in process research and development 
the valuation of acquired in process research and development represents the estimated fair value related to incomplete projects that  at the time of the cor acquisition  had no alternative future use and for which technological feasibility had not been established 
the income approach was used to establish the fair values of developed technology  trademark and acquired in process research and development 
this approach establishes the fair value of an asset by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to the asset over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
the discounting process uses a rate of return commensurate with the time value of money and investment risk factors 
accordingly  for the purpose of establishing the fair value of developed technology  trademark and acquired in process research and development  revenues for each future period were estimated  along with costs  expenses  taxes and other charges 
revenue estimates were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the in process technology we acquired from cor consisted of five significant research and development projects with values assigned of million to million for each project 
these projects include the development of pipeline products for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases  including acute myocardial infarction  restenosis  cirrhosis  pulmonary fibrosis  venous thrombosis  and stroke prevention  as well as in the area of oncology 
through the acquisition date  cor had spent approximately million to million on each of these five in process research and development projects 
at the time of acquisition  we expected to incur an additional million to million of development expenses for each of these five significant projects 
as we continue to prioritize our projects  we are currently allocating limited resources to one of the projects acquired 
as of december   we expect to incur an additional million to million of research and development expenses for each of the four projects 
the five projects acquired  which are in various stages of preclinical and phase ii clinical trials  were expected to reach completion in through as of december   the four projects are expected to reach completion in through a major risk associated with the timely completion and commercialization of these products is the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data of long term clinical trials 
if these projects are not successfully developed  future results of operations may be adversely affected 
additionally  the value of the other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
we believe that the assumptions used to value the acquired intangibles and in process research and development were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project revenues  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary from the projected results 
amortization of intangible assets in the period relates to specifically identified intangible assets from the cor  leukosite and cdc acquisitions 
amortization of intangible assets in the period relates to existing technology  assembled workforce and goodwill acquired through the acquisitions of leukosite and cdc 
amortization expense decreased to million in the period from million in the period due to the adoption of sfas no 
following our adoption of sfas effective as of january   we continue to amortize specifically identifiable intangible assets and ceased amortizing goodwill and assembled workforce which was reclassified to goodwill 
investment income decreased to million in the period from million in the period 
the decrease is primarily attributable to unfavorable market conditions resulting in lower yields 
net realized gains on marketable securities increased to million in the period from million in the period 
the increase relates to realized gains recognized from sales of marketable securities of million in the period  offset by an increase in realized losses of million 
because we realized significant gains from our investment portfolio during  we expect realized gains on the sales of marketable securities to decrease in future periods 
interest expense increased to million in the period from million in the period 
the change relates to increased interest due to the assumption of million of principal of the notes and notes 
we also recognized a non cash charge of million in the period relating to the fair value of the premium put placed on these notes 
see contractual obligations for further discussion of the put options 
we sold our equity interest in m i and in considerations for the sale  we received contingent consideration of million based upon the achievement of sales milestones in the period and million plus additional contingent consideration based upon future us sales of campath in the period 
years ended december  and december  for the period  we had a net loss of million or per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million or per basic and diluted share for the year ended december  the period 
revenue under strategic alliances increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase is primarily attributable to increased revenue from the bayer  aventis and taisho alliances 
the increase in bayer revenue relates primarily to increased milestone and research revenue during the period 
the increase in aventis revenue is due to the fact that the alliance was in place for a full year during the period versus a partial year in the period 
taisho revenue increased as the research program expanded 
included in revenue is million of revenue that was recognized in prior years relating to the adoption of sab included in revenue is million of revenue that was recognized in prior years relating to the adoption of sab under the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition  we are required to periodically review and update our estimates as experience develops and as new information becomes known 
to reflect research productivity improvements  management revised its estimate of the remaining work to be performed under the bayer alliance  which resulted in a cumulative catch up adjustment of million of additional revenue in september excluding the impact of this change in estimate  net loss attributable to common stockholders and the related earnings per share amounts for the year ended december  would have been million and per share 
research and development expenses increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase was primarily attributable to our continued investment in building a sustainable product pipeline  with increases in personnel and facilities  expenses relating to clinical trials and preclinical product candidates  technology license payments and purchases of laboratory supplies 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase was largely due to the expansion of our commercial organization  other business groups  facilities and infrastructure in support of the development of our product pipeline and growth in all areas of our business 
significant increases were primarily in consulting  personnel expenses and facility expenses 
amortization of intangible assets relates to existing technology  assembled workforce and goodwill acquired through the acquisitions of leukosite and cdc 
amortization expense increased to million in the period from million in the period due to a full year of amortization of the cdc goodwill and other intangible assets during versus a partial year in equity in operations of the m i joint venture was income of million for the period and a loss of million for the period 
the income in the period was primarily due to profits from the launch of campath in the us and europe by m i during the loss in the period was primarily attributable to pre product launch marketing and sales activities of the joint venture 
we sold our interest in the partnership to ilex on december  in consideration for the sale of our interest to ilex  we received million in investment income increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase resulted primarily from a higher average level of invested funds due to net proceeds from our public stock offering in october of million and million in net proceeds from our notes offering which closed in january interest expense decreased to million for the period from million for the period due to a decrease in the average outstanding debt 
during the period we paid an aggregate of million and during the period we paid an aggregate of million in cash to certain holders of our notes in order to induce the conversion of their notes into our common stock 
these cash payments were expensed during the respective periods 
the minority interest in the period consisted of the minority shareholder interest of becton  dickinson and company in the net income for the period of our then majority owned subsidiary  millennium predictive medicine  inc  or mpmx 
on june   we acquired the outstanding preferred stock of our mpmx subsidiary that we did not already own  making mpmx a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
we recorded a deemed preferred stock dividend of million in relating to the excess of the fair value of our common stock over the carrying value of the mpmx minority interest acquired from becton dickinson 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operating expenses  to make capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments and to pay debt service  including principal and interest and capital lease payments 
we have also made strategic commitments to purchase debt and or equity securities from certain of our partners in accordance with our board approved policies and our business needs 
these investment commitments are generally in smaller companies 
we may lose money in these investments and our ability to liquidate these investments is in some cases very limited 
we may also owe our partners milestone payments and royalties and we have committed to fund development costs incurred by some of our partners 
as described above under overview financial resources  we expect that our cash requirements for all of these uses will increase as the scale of our operations grows 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through the following payments from our strategic collaborators including license fees  milestone payments and research funding  equity investments by our strategic collaborators  equity and debt financings  including  property and equipment financings  and net cash acquired in connection with acquisitions 
in the future  we expect to continue to fund our cash requirements from some of these external sources as well as the sales of integrilin eptifibatide injection and other products 
in particular  we are entitled to additional committed research and development funding under a number of our strategic alliances and we expect to receive additional substantial payments from ilex as a result of our sale of our joint venture interest in m i 
we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash are revenues and margins from sales of integrilin and other products and services for which we obtain marketing approval in the future  the success of our clinical and preclinical development programs  our ability to gain regulatory approval and commercialize our clinical product candidates  the receptivity of the capital markets to financings by biopharmaceutical companies  our ability to enter into additional strategic collaborations and to maintain existing and new collaborations and the success of such collaborations  and the sales levels of campath 
as of december   we had approximately billion in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
this excludes million of interest bearing marketable securities classified as restricted cash on our balance sheet as of december   which serve as collateral for letters of credit securing leased facilities 
cash flows we used million of cash in operating activities in the period and million in the period 
the principal use of cash in operating activities in both and was to fund our net loss

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we manage our investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs  and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
investments are made primarily in high grade corporate bonds with effective maturities of three years or less  asset backed and us government agency securities 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of debt instruments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
as of december   the fair value of our and notes  including the put options  is approximately million 
the fair value of our notes approximates its carrying value 
the interest rates on our convertible notes and capital lease obligations are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate risk 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments which would require disclosure under this item 
as of december  we did not have any financing arrangements that were not reflected in our balance sheet
