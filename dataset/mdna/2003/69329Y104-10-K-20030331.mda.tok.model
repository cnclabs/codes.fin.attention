overview in general  we have a history of operating losses and may not achieve sustained profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our expenses will increase because of the extensive resource commitments required to identify and develop antibody candidates  achieve regulatory approval and market potential products for commercial success for any individual product 
over the next several years  we expect to incur substantial additional expenses as we continue to identify  develop and manufacture our potential products  invest in research and improve and expand our development  manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
in february  we announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement with eos biotechnology  inc  a privately held south san francisco based antibody discovery company  for million shares of our common stock 
the acquisition is expected to close early in the second quarter of the eos acquisition allows us to expand our research personnel and add new capabilities in antibody target identification and validation  particularly in oncology 
we will also have obtained two pre clinical antibody product candidates  one of which is expected to begin clinical development for potential treatment of solid tumors in the first half of  and the second  in early in conjunction with the merger  we expect to record a charge related to acquired in process research and development 
we will report the purchase accounting effects of the merger in our financial results for the period in which the transaction closes 
since we or our collaborative partners or licensees may not be able to successfully develop additional products  obtain required regulatory approvals  manufacture products at an acceptable cost and with appropriate quality  or successfully market such products with desired margins  we may never achieve sustained profitable operations 
the amount of net losses and the time required to reach sustained profitability are highly uncertain 
although we have had some profitable reporting periods  we do not expect to achieve sustained profitability until we are able to market and sell products 
our commitment of resources to research and the continued development of our products will require significant additional funds 
our operating expenses may also increase as some of our earlier stage potential products move into later stage clinical development  as additional potential products are selected as clinical candidates for further development  as we invest in additional manufacturing capacity  as we defend or prosecute our patents and patent applications  and as we invest in research or acquire additional technologies  product candidates or businesses 
in the absence of substantial revenues from new corporate collaborations or patent rights or patent licensing or humanization agreements  significant royalties on sales of products licensed under our intellectual property rights  product sales or other uncertain sources of revenue  we will incur substantial operating losses 
our revenues  expenses and operating results will likely fluctuate in future periods 
our revenues have varied in the past and will likely continue to fluctuate considerably from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
as a result  our revenues in any period may not be predictive of revenues in any subsequent period 
our royalty revenues may be unpredictable and may fluctuate since they depend upon the seasonality of sales of licensed products  the existence of competing products  the marketing efforts of our licensees  potential reductions in royalties payable to us due to credits for prior payments to us  the timing of royalty reports  some of which are required quarterly and others semi annually  our method of accounting for royalty revenues from our licensees in the period reported to us  and our ability to successfully defend and enforce our patents 
we receive royalty revenues on sales of the product synagis 
this product has higher sales in the fall and winter  which to date have resulted in much higher royalties recognized by us in our first and second quarters than in other quarters 
the seasonality of synagis sales could contribute to future fluctuation of our royalty revenues from quarter to quarter 
license and other revenue may also be unpredictable and may fluctuate due to the timing of payments of upfront fees  payments for manufacturing and clinical development services and payments for the achievement of milestones under new and existing collaborative  humanization  and patent licensing agreements 
revenue historically recognized under our prior agreements may not be an indicator of revenue from any future collaborations 
in addition  our expenses may be unpredictable and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of expenses  which may include clinical trial expenses as well as payments owed by us and to us under collaborative agreements for reimbursement of expenses and which are reported under our policy during the quarter in which such expenses are reported to us or to our collaborative partners and agreed to by us or our partners 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition we currently recognize three types of revenues resulting from the licensing and use of our technology  and from services we sometimes perform in connection with the licensed technology 
these revenues are typically derived from our proprietary patent portfolio covering the humanization of antibodies for use in drug development and production 
revenues  and their respective treatment for financial reporting purposes  are as follows upfront and license maintenance fees we generally recognize revenue from upfront fees when the agreement is signed  we have completed the earnings process and we have no ongoing performance obligation with respect to the arrangement 
revenues recognized from upfront fees typically relate to patent license and patent rights agreements 
under patent license agreements  the licensee typically obtains a non exclusive license to our patents 
in this arrangement  the licensee is responsible for all of the development work on its product 
the licensee has the technical ability to perform the humanization of the antibody it is developing using our patented technology  but needs to obtain a license from us to avoid infringing our patents 
we have no future performance obligations under these agreements 
under patent rights agreements  licensees currently purchase a research patent license  in exchange for an upfront fee  and a right to obtain  in exchange for consideration separate from the upfront fee  patent licenses for commercial purposes for a specified number of drug targets to be designated by the licensee subsequent to execution of the agreement 
all of the research is performed by the licensee  and therefore  upon delivery of the patent rights agreement  the earnings process is complete and we have no further performance obligations with respect to the research patent license and the grant of the right to obtain commercial patent licenses 
subsequent to execution of the agreement  the licensee has the right to purchase patent licenses to certain designated targets  for which the licensee pays separate consideration at a later date 
such consideration is recognized upon exercise of such right  execution and delivery of the associated patent license agreement and when payment is reasonably assured 
under our humanization agreements  at times referred to in our previous filings as research and development agreements  the licensee typically pays an upfront fee for us to humanize an antibody 
these upfront fees are recognized on a percent completion basis  as the humanization work is performed  which is typically over three to six months 
under patent license agreements and humanization agreements  we may also receive annual license maintenance fees  payable at the election of the licensee to maintain the license in effect 
we have no performance obligations with respect to such fees 
maintenance fees are recognized as they are due and when payment is reasonably assured 
milestone payments certain agreements include milestone payments which are recognized as revenue when earned as part of a multi element arrangement 
each element of the contract represents a separate earnings process and as such we recognize milestone amounts when the associated earnings process is complete and  to the extent the milestone amount relates to our performance obligation  when our customer confirms that we have met the requirements under the terms of the agreement and when payment is reasonably assured 
generally  there are three types of agreements under which a customer would owe us a milestone payment humanization agreements provide for the payment of certain milestones to us after the completion of services to perform the humanization process 
these milestones include delivery of a humanized antibody meeting a certain binding affinity and  at the customer s election  delivery of a cell line meeting certain criteria described in the original agreement 
we recognize these milestones when we have no further performance obligations with respect to that milestone and the funding party confirms that the milestone stipulated in the agreement has been met 
patent license agreements and humanization agreements sometimes require our customers to make milestone payments to us when they achieve certain progress  such as fda approval  with respect to the customer s product 
because we have no obligations with respect to any of this activity  we record these milestone payments as revenue when received and we have confirmed that the milestone has been achieved 
we may also receive certain milestone payments in connection with licensing technology to or from our partners  such as product licenses 
under these agreements  our partners may make milestone payments to us when we or they achieve certain levels of development with respect to the licensed technology 
these fees are recognized when we have no further performance obligations with respect to the applicable milestone and it is confirmed that the milestone stipulated in the agreement has been met 
royalties under some of our agreements  we also receive royalty payments based upon our licensees net sales of products 
generally  we receive royalty reports from such licensees approximately one quarter in arrears  that is  generally at the end of the second month of the quarter after the licensee has sold the royalty bearing product 
we recognize royalty revenues when we can reliably estimate such amounts and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accordingly  we have adopted an accounting policy of recording the royalty revenue in the quarter it is reported to us ie  generally revenue is recognized one quarter following the quarter in which sales occurred 
clinical trial expenses our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential drugs 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events or the successful accrual of patients or the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expenses related to each patient enrolled in a clinical trial are recognized ratably beginning upon entry into the trial and over the course of the patients continued participation in the trial 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we accrue an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial 
our estimates and assumptions could differ significantly from the amounts which may actually be incurred 
valuation of financial instruments we invest our excess cash balances primarily in short term and long term marketable debt securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
estimated fair value is based upon quoted market prices for these or similar instruments 
all available for sale securities in our portfolio have readily determinable market prices 
in determining if and when a decline in market value below amortized cost is other than temporary  we evaluate the market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings  price multiples  and other key measures for our investments in marketable debt securities 
if such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline 
historically  we have not recognized any impairment losses on our available for sale securities  nor have we realized gains or losses on the sale of available for sale securities  as all securities liquidated have been held to maturity 
cost method investments in determining if and when a cost method investment s decline in estimated fair value below cost is other than temporary  we evaluate the general market conditions  the operating results and business prospects of our investees  and other key considerations 
when such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss on the investment in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline 
results of operations years ended december   and in thousands years ended december  annual percen t change total revenues    total revenues the company s total revenues for were million  a increase from primarily due to higher royalties  partially offset by lower license and other income 
total revenues for were million  a increase from primarily due to higher royalties  partially offset by lower license and other income 
these revenue changes are further discussed below 
in thousands years ended december  annual percen t change royalties    license and other    royalties royalty revenues recognized under agreements with roche  genentech  medimmune and wyeth were million in  an increase of from royalty revenue was million in  an increase of from the increase in was primarily due to higher third party sales of synagis reported by medimmune and herceptin reported by genentech 
royalty revenues from medimmune and genentech accounted for and of our royalty revenues in  respectively 
the increase in was also due to higher third party sales of synagis as reported by medimmune and herceptin as reported by genentech 
royalty revenues from medimmune and genentech accounted for and of our royalty revenues in  respectively 
we expect that in  the increase in royalty revenues will be at a lower rate than we expect quarterly fluctuations in royalty revenues due to the seasonality of sales of synagis 
license and other revenues license and other revenues were million in  a decrease of from license and other revenues were million in  a decrease of from license and other revenues recognized primarily consist of upfront patent licensing and patent rights fees  milestones  amortization of upfront fees associated with humanization agreements and license maintenance fees 
the decrease in was primarily due to the fact that we entered into fewer patent licensing  patent rights and humanization agreements in as compared with and due to greater milestone and humanization revenue in as compared with in  we entered into one patent rights and one patent licensing agreement  as compared with three patent rights agreements in in addition  in  we recognized over million in milestone and humanization revenue  with no such comparable revenue in the decrease in was primarily due to the recognition of less revenue under patent licensing  patent rights and research and development funding from a third party that expired in november we expect quarterly fluctuations in license and other revenues depending on the number of new contract arrangements and milestones achieved by our licensees 
costs and expenses in thousands years ended december  annual percen t change research and development    general and administrative    total cost and exepnses    research and development expenses research and development expenses in were million  an increase of from research and development expenses in were million  an increase of from research and development costs include costs of personnel to support our research and development activities  costs of preclinical studies  costs of conducting our clinical trials  such as clinical investigator fees  monitoring costs  data management and drug supply costs  research and development funding provided to third parties and an allocation of facility costs 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in research and development personnel headcount of approximately employees and associated costs of approximately million  higher research and development funding provided to exelixis of million reflecting a full year of funding in compared to a partial year of funding in and preclinical studies of million 
the increase in was primarily related to an increase in research and development personnel headcount of approximately employees and associated costs of approximately million  higher research and development funding provided to exelixis of million compared to no such funding in and increased clinical trial expenses related to the expansion of clinical development programs of million  offset in part by lower research and development reimbursement funding of million and contract manufacturing costs associated with the humanized anti il antibody of million 
we expect our research and development expenses will increase further as we invest in manufacturing  advance our product candidates progress into later stages of development and add new product candidates 
more specifically  the increase is expected to be related primarily to expanded clinical trial activity  including associated direct scale up and manufacturing expenses  and the additional headcount required to execute our clinical trial programs and to continue to develop our research  preclinical  manufacturing and process development infrastructure 
in addition  we anticipate that completion of the eos acquisition would add research and development expenses of approximately million to million in  primarily related to additional headcount  manufacturing expense  rent and on going collaborations 
certain of these operating expenses related to manufacturing and clinical development are not expected to continue beyond since certain eos programs currently rely on outside manufacturing and other contract organizations 
reliance on these organizations beyond is expected to be reduced given our internal capabilities and core competencies in these areas 
below is a summary of products and the related stages of development for each product in clinical development  including the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion of phase is only our estimate of the timing of completion of product development phases 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see the clinical development is inherently uncertain and expense levels may fluctuate unexpectedly because we can not accurately predict the timing and level of such expenses  if we cannot successfully complete our clinical trials  we will be unable to obtain regulatory approvals required to market our products  our clinical trial strategy may increase the risk of clinical trial difficulties  if our collaborations are not successful  we may not be able to effectively develop and market some of our products  if we do not attract and retain key employees  our business could be impaired  and we may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for our products sections of our risk factors above

no further internal development of this product is currently expected 
product development terminated under agreement with toagosei 
no single potential product included in other constitutes more than of the total research and development costs for the specified year 
the overall completion dates or total costs to complete our major research and development programs are estimates based on current information 
the clinical development portion of these programs may span as many as seven to ten years and any further estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products  including significant and changing government regulation  the uncertainty of future preclinical and clinical study results and uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as marketing 
these risks and uncertainties make reliably estimating overall completion dates and total costs to complete development highly speculative 
for additional discussion of factors affecting overall completion dates and total costs  see the clinical development is inherently uncertain and expense levels may fluctuate unexpectedly because we cannot accurately predict the timing and level of such expenses section of our risk factors above 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses in were million  an increase of from in  general and administrative expenses were million  an increase of from general and administrative costs include costs of personnel  professional services  consulting and other expenses related to our administrative functions and an allocation of facility costs 
the increase in was primarily related to increased personnel and recruiting costs of million  legal costs related to our intellectual property  licensing and other contractual matters of million and million related to maintenance agreements for our document control software systems 
the increase in was primarily due to increased personnel and recruiting costs  pre marketing expenses associated with our clinical development program  legal costs related to our intellectual property  licensing and other contractual matters and increased third party royalty expenses associated with higher sales by one of our licensees 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we build infrastructure and support for expanded research and development capabilities of our organization 
interest income  interest expense and investment impairment in thousands years ended december  annual percen t change interest income    interest expense    impairment loss on investment 
 interest income and expense interest income in was million  a decrease of from in  interest income was million  an increase of from the decrease in interest earned in was largely due to the decreased interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances primarily as a result of lower interest rates and to a lesser extent  lower invested balances 
the increase in interest earned in was primarily attributable to the increase in our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable debt securities balances as a result of our public offering of common stock in the second half of that raised approximately in net proceeds and the sale of million of convertible subordinated notes in february interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  was related to our convertible subordinated notes and a term loan associated with the purchase our fremont  california facilities 
interest expense in was million  a decrease of from interest expense in was million  an increase of from the decrease in was the result of capitalizing million of our interest cost in connection with the renovation of our existing manufacturing facilities and the development and construction activities for our future manufacturing facilities 
the increase in was attributable to twelve months of interest expense in versus ten and one half months of interest expense in in connection with the issuance of our convertible subordinated notes in february impairment loss on investment in january  we sold the assets of our small molecule group to signature bioscience  inc signature  a privately held drug discovery company  in exchange for  shares of signature convertible preferred stock 
the stock received was recorded at the net book value of the assets sold plus transaction costs incurred  which approximated million 
in conjunction with this transaction  in december  we accrued an additional million payable to signature in connection with cash retention bonuses to designated key employees still employed by signature after one year 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  in exchange for these bonus payments we received in early an additional  shares of signature convertible preferred stock  which was recorded as an increase in the carrying value of the preferred stock 
since the shares we received are not publicly traded  the value of the shares is difficult to estimate 
as of december   we estimated that the value of our investment in signature bioscience  inc had declined to  and that an impairment of our investment had occurred and that such impairment was other then temporary 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in december the amount of the charge was based on the difference between the estimated fair value as determined by our management and our original cost basis in the shares of approximately million 
if we deem the estimated fair value of the shares of signature further impaired at the end of any future period  we may incur an additional impairment charge with respect to these shares 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of equity and debt securities  revenue under agreements with third parties and interest income on invested capital 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in the aggregate of million  compared to million at december  net cash used in our operating activities in was approximately million compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million in the change was primarily due to a net loss in  partially offset by a decrease in interest receivable in versus an increase in interest receivable in and the non cash impairment loss on an investment in the decrease in net cash provided by our operating activities in as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in was primarily due an increase in interest receivable and other current assets  partially offset by higher net income in net cash provided by our investing activities in was million compared to net cash used in our investing activities of million in the change in was primarily the result of an increase in maturities of marketable securities and a decrease in purchases of marketable securities during the period as compared to our maturities and reinvestment activities associated with the purchases of short and long term investments in capital expenditures in were primarily related to the purchase of land  renovation of our plymouth  minnesota manufacturing facility and development and construction activities for our future manufacturing facility in brooklyn park  minnesota 
capital expenditures in primarily consisted of equipment purchases and renovation of our plymouth  minnesota manufacturing facility 
the increase in net cash used in our investing activities in as compared to net cash used in our investing activities of million in was primarily the result of an increase in the maturities and purchases of marketable securities and the purchase of a convertible note from exelixis offset by an increase in maturities of marketable securities 
net cash provided by our financing activities in was million compared to million in the period 
the change in from was primarily the result of a decrease in the exercise of outstanding stock options 
the decrease in net cash provided by our financing activities in as compared to net cash provided by our financing activities of million in was primarily the result of our sale of million of convertible subordinated notes in february and our public offering of common stock in the second half of  which raised approximately million in net proceeds 
we estimate that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations for at least the next few years 
our future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including  among others  interest income  royalties from sales of products by third party licensees  including synagis  herceptin  zenapax and mylotarg  our ability to enter into additional collaborative  humanization  patent license and patent rights agreements  progress of product candidates in clinical trials  the ability of our licensees to obtain regulatory approval and successfully manufacture and market products licensed under our patents  the continued or additional support by our collaborative partners or other third parties of research and development efforts and clinical trials  investment in existing and new research and development programs  time required to gain regulatory approvals  significant resources we will devote to constructing our manufacturing facilities  our ability to obtain and retain funding from third parties under collaborative arrangements  our continued development of internal marketing and sales capabilities  the demand for our potential products  if and when approved  potential acquisitions of technology  product candidates or businesses by us  and the costs of defending or prosecuting any patent opposition or litigation necessary to protect our proprietary technology 
in order to develop and commercialize our potential products we may need to raise substantial additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements  the use of sponsored research efforts or other means 
no assurance can be given that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and such financing may only be available on terms dilutive to existing stockholders 
in fremont  california  menlo park  california  somerville  new jersey  plymouth  minnesota and paris  france  we occupy leased facilities under agreements that expire in    and  respectively 
we also have leased certain office equipment under operating leases 
in september  fremont holding llc our wholly owned subsidiary obtained a million term loan to purchase our fremont  california facilities 
the loan bears interest at the rate of per year amortized over years with principal and interest payable monthly 
the loan is secured by our fremont  california facilities and is subject to the terms and covenants of the loan agreement 
in february  we issued convertible subordinated notes due february  with a principal amount of million the convertible notes 
the convertible notes are convertible at the holders option into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment as a result of certain events 
interest on the convertible notes is payable semiannually in arrears on february and august of each year 
the convertible notes are unsecured and are subordinated to all our existing and future senior indebtedness as defined in the indenture relating to the convertible notes 
the convertible notes may be redeemed at our option  in whole or in part  beginning on february  at the redemption prices set forth in the convertible notes indenture 
in may  we signed a collaborative agreement with exelixis to discover and develop humanized antibodies for the diagnosis  prevention and treatment of cancer 
we agreed to provide exelixis with million in annual research funding through june   and we purchased a million five year note  convertible at our option after the first year of the collaboration into exelixis common stock 
the research funding period will end in june during the funding period  exelixis performs certain genetic screens and other research activities intended to identify and validate targets for antibody therapeutics in oncology 
we received an exclusive  worldwide license to develop antibodies against certain targets identified by exelixis that are involved in cell growth  cell death and proliferation 
exelixis has the right to co fund development of antibodies resulting from the collaboration 
therefore  we recognized the expense of research funding ratably over the periods for which it was performed 
for antibody products we develop that exelixis elects not to co fund  we have agreed to make specified milestone payments and royalty payments on any product sales 
in connection with the construction of our new commercial manufacturing facility in brooklyn park  minnesota  we have entered into  and will continue to enter into  agreements with third parties for the construction and design of the facility 
as of july  we have engaged fluor daniel a division of fluor enterprises to handle the engineering and certain procurement services 
under that agreement  we will owe an aggregate of approximately million to be paid in and the design and project management work to be completed under this agreement is scheduled for completion in the third quarter of and the construction support work is scheduled to be completed by the third quarter of in addition  we have entered into various commitments related to the manufacturing equipment required for the new facility of approximately million  which is to be paid in additionally  as of september and october  respectively  we have entered into an interim construction management agreement and a purchasing agreement  respectively  with mcgough construction and are in final negotiations with mcgough on agreements for the construction management and certain construction services for the facility

recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 
fas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
the company is in the process of assessing the effect of adopting fas  which will be effective for the company s year ending december  in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas  which provides guidance related to accounting for costs associated with disposal activities covered by fas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets or with exit or restructuring activities previously covered by eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
fas supersedes eitf issue no 
in its entirety 
fas requires that costs related to exiting an activity or to a restructuring not be recognized until the liability is incurred 
fas will be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including residual value guarantees issued in conjunction with operating lease agreements 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  our adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fas 
fas amends fas accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  fas amends the disclosure requirements of fas to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the additional disclosure requirements of fas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
or apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for employee stock options and have made the appropriate disclosures in accordance with fas in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structures used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position  because we do not have any transactions involving variable interest entities 
item a 
market risk s interest rate risk we maintain a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  highly liquid  debt securities which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  or type of instrument 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we hold a million five year convertible note receivable purchased from exelixis  inc in may accounting rules require the conversion feature of some convertible notes to be separated from the debt agreement in which the conversion feature is contained and accounted for as a derivative instrument  and therefore reflected in the note purchaser s financial statements based upon the fair market value of the stock into which the note is convertible 
due in part to the number of shares into which this note receivable would currently convert and the average daily trading volume of exelixis stock  the exelixis note is not currently considered a derivative instrument and  therefore  changes in the market value of exelixis stock are not required to be recorded in our financial statements 
however  a significant increase in the average daily trading volume of exelixis stock  or changes or interpretations in accounting principles could require us to report the value of the exelixis stock in our financial statements 
such a requirement could cause us to include changes in the exelixis stock price on a quarterly basis and would contribute to fluctuation in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged and are classified as available for sale and therefore are subject to interest rate risk 
we do not currently hedge interest rate exposure 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  levels  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest
