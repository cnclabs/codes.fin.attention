critical accounting policies  significant estimates and judgments the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page of this annual report on form k and which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents we believe that the policies  significant estimates and judgments discussed below are the most critical to our financial statements and the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment 
a revenue recognition our revenues consist of software license revenues and service revenues 
software license revenues are recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  software license revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery of the software has occurred  provided that the license fee is fixed or determinable  collection is considered reasonably assured and no customer acceptance clauses exist 
if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  revenue recognition occurs upon the earlier of a receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
if the fee is determined not to be fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized when the fees become due 
if collection is not considered reasonably assured  revenue is recognized upon the receipt of cash 
revenues under multiple element arrangements  which typically include software products  services and maintenance sold together  are allocated to each element using the residual method in accordance with sop under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and subsequently recognized when these elements are delivered  the remainder of the arrangement consideration is allocated to the software 
we have established sufficient vendor specific objective evidence for professional services  training and maintenance and customer support services based on the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
accordingly  software license revenues are recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is licensed with professional services  training  and maintenance and customer support services 
service revenues include professional services  training and maintenance and customer support fees 
professional services are not essential to the functionality of the other elements in an arrangement and are accounted for separately 
service revenues are recognized as the services are performed  provided evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered reasonably assured 
we license our software to end users  resellers and oem s 
all revenues generated from our worldwide operations are approved at our corporate headquarters  located in the united states 
our arrangements do not generally include clauses involving acceptance of our products by our customers 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  revenue recognition occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
for all sales  in the absence of a signed license agreement  we use either a purchase order or purchase order equivalent as evidence of an arrangement 
if a signed license agreement is obtained  we use either the license agreement or the license agreement and a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
sales to resellers are usually evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
sales to oem s are usually evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with a shipping report on a transaction by transaction basis 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier and the delivery terms are fob concord 
in the case of arrangements with resellers or oems  revenue is recognized upon delivery to the reseller or to the oem 
most of these arrangements involve a sell through by the reseller or oem to an end user 
for a reseller  evidence usually comes in the form of a purchase order identifying the end user while for an oem  evidence of sell through usually comes in the form of a shipping report  which usually identifies the ship to location 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are usually to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when the fee is due 

table of contents we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue upon receipt of cash 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
this means that we defer revenue from the fee arrangement equivalent to the fair values of the undelivered elements 
we determine fair values for ongoing maintenance and support obligations using our internal pricing policies for maintenance and by referencing the prices at which we have sold separate maintenance contract renewals to our customers 
we determine fair values of services  such as training or consulting  by referencing the prices at which we have separately sold comparable services to our customers 
b accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
c accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
to do this  we estimate our actual current tax liabilities  while also assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue and expense accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of the utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards from prior years 
we are unsure whether we will have sufficient future taxable income to allow us to use these net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance 
establishing new or additional valuation allowances could materially adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
pro forma financial results we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain pro forma financial information in the related earnings release and investor conference call 
this pro forma financial information excludes certain non cash and special charges  consisting primarily of non cash compensation charges and transaction costs associated with acquisitions 
this proforma calculation also substitutes current period gaap tax provisions with a pro forma tax rate 
we have significant deferred tax assets and have not recorded a 
table of contents federal tax provision in or the tax provision in and relates to state and foreign taxes only 
management uses the pro forma information to evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
similarly  we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we present both gaap and proforma eps results and urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q  our annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings releases 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data as percentages of concord s total revenues 
year ended december  revenues license revenues service revenues total revenues cost of revenues cost of license revenues cost of service revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative asset impairment charge stock based compensation acquisition related charges total operating expenses operating loss total other income  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes income loss before extraordinary items extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt  net of tax benefit net income loss total revenues total revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and a decrease of from to license revenues concord s license revenues are derived from the licensing of software products 
license revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and a decrease of from to license revenues accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the continuing decrease in license revenues in absolute dollars from to and from to was due  in large part  to decreases in  or postponements or cancellations of it infrastructure purchases by some of our customers due to worldwide economic uncertainty 
in addition to the continuing worldwide slowdown in the economy  political uncertainty 
table of contents resulting in financial instability in brazil  reduced spending by some telecommunication carriers on their infrastructures and the announcement of accounting improprieties by a few major us based firms have also negatively affected it spending by our customers and potential customers 
the continuing decrease in license revenues as a percent of total revenues from to and from to was the result of a significant increase in service revenues  consisting mainly of maintenance revenues 
there were no material price increases for products during  or inflation did not have a significant impact on our revenues or income during  or service revenues concord s service revenues consist of fees for maintenance  training and professional services 
service revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to service revenues accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in service revenues was mainly due to a significant increase in maintenance revenues which are generated from new and renewed maintenance contracts 
maintenance revenues represent fees earned by granting our customers rights to technical support  software product upgrades and maintenance patches during the support period  which is usually one year 
the majority of our license customers purchase maintenance upon the initial licensing of our software 
in addition  the majority of these customers renew their maintenance agreements annually 
an increase in the number of the company s customers and the resulting demand for these services further helped drive the increase in service revenues from to and from to international revenues concord s international revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
our international revenues were primarily generated from customers located in europe 
revenues from customers located in europe accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the continued increase in international revenues as a percentage of total revenues is primarily the result of concord s expansion of its operations outside the united states  which has included both the hiring of additional personnel as well as the establishment of additional reseller relationships 
we believe that continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of our sales  marketing and customer service functions in international markets 
we expect to commit additional time and development resources to customizing our products and services for selected international markets 
segment revenues concord s reportable segments are determined by customer type managed service providers telecommunications carriers msp tc and enterprise 
concord s msp tc revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing approximately  and of total revenues  respectively 
the decrease in msp tc revenues as a percentage of total revenues in was attributable to reduced spending by major telecommunications firms on it infrastructure projects 
the general slowdown of the economy in the united states and abroad  the overcapacity in the telecommunications infrastructure market and the bankruptcies of some major us carriers have all contributed to the lower spending by this segment 
additionally  the decrease in msp tc revenues as a percent of total revenues was the result of an increase in enterprise revenues  including both new and existing customers 
concord s enterprise revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing approximately  and of total revenues  respectively 
the increase in enterprise revenues in  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  was due to an increase in orders from new customers and repeat sales to existing customers 

table of contents cost of license revenues cost of license revenues includes expenses associated with royalty fees  production  fulfillment and product documentation 
cost of licenses was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to was due  in part  to lower fulfillment costs 
in  these costs were lower due to a decreased number of product updates sent to customers and improved efficiencies in the distribution process of these upgrades 
the increase from to was due  in part  to higher fulfillment costs cost of service revenues cost of service revenues includes the personnel costs associated with providing customer support in connection with maintenance  training and professional service contracts 
cost of service was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the cost of service revenues was driven by lower use of outside consultants to deliver the training and professional services 
the increase from to was an increase in customer support spending associated with service revenues to be more responsive to growing customer needs 
gross profit total gross profit includes gross profit from license revenues and gross profit from service revenues 
total gross profit was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in total gross profit and gross profit percentage from to was attributable to an increase of total revenues combined with a decrease of the cost of service and cost of license revenues 
the decrease in total gross profit and gross profit percentage from to was primarily the result of a shift in the revenue mix from license revenues to service revenues as well as the increase of cost of service 
we expect to increase our gross profit in absolute dollars  however  this will depend upon our revenue growth  among other factors 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in increasing our gross profit on an absolute basis of total revenues 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with software development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to research and development expenses accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to lower use of outside consultants  lower employee benefits expenses due to an increase in employee share of the cost of health insurance  and a decrease in other employee related costs driven by lower headcount 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to higher compensation expenses associated with software developers and development support personnel  as well as associated benefits and facilities costs 
headcount in research and development was  and people in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to commit substantial resources to research and development in the future and that product development expenses may increase in absolute dollars in future periods  however  we intend to decrease our research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues 
our ability to decrease these expenses as a percentage of revenues will depend upon our revenue growth  among other factors 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in decreasing our research and development expenses either on an absolute basis or as a percentage of total revenues 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions to sales personnel and agents  travel  tradeshow participation  public relations  advertising and other promotional expenses

our sales force is compensated on the initial sales of license and services 
the increase from to was the result of increased headcount needed to build the direct sales force along with strong channel partners to penetrate the market 
additionally  the costs to market a multi product  multi market solution set are higher than the single product  single market solution sold in prior years 
headcount in sales and marketing was  and people in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to commit substantial resources to sales and marketing in the future and that sales and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars in future periods  however  we intend to decrease our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues 
our ability to decrease these expenses as a percentage of revenues will depend upon our revenue growth  among other factors 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in decreasing our sales and marketing expenses either on an absolute basis or as a percentage of total revenues 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for financial  accounting  legal  investor relations  human resources  administrative and management personnel

asset impairment charge concord acquired a million interest in broadband investment group broadband in september in exchange for our products and services 
in november  broadband publicly announced that it was ceasing operations and liquidating its remaining assets following its inability to raise additional capital due to unfavorable market conditions

accounts receivable increased approximately  during primarily due to slower collections particularly with international customers 
our annual days of sales outstanding dso remained relatively constant at days at december  compared to days at december  dso measures both the age  in terms of days  of our accounts receivable and the average time it takes to turn the receivable into cash 
there are a number of factors affecting dso  including our payment terms and collection ability 
deferred revenue increased approximately million during mainly due to an increase in new and renewed maintenance contracts 
investing activities have consisted of the acquisition of property and equipment  most notably computer and networking equipment to support the corporate infrastructure  and also investments in marketable securities 
the company manages its market risk on its investment securities by selecting investment grade securities with the highest credit ratings of relatively short duration that trade in highly liquid markets

table of contents as of december   the company has future payments under facility and certain equipment lease agreements expiring through july of million  million and million in one year  two to three years  and thereafter  respectively 
in addition  the company is obligated to make minimum royalty payments in and under a software license agreement

 management of the company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets  which consist principally of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company has significantly reserved for these deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance of  at december  the resulting net deferred tax asset is based on the company s estimate of future taxable income it expects to generate  all other tax assets have been fully reserved 
the factors that weighed most heavily on management s decision to record this amount of a valuation allowance were the company s history of prior profitability  current profitability  current economic conditions and forecasted profitability over the next several years 
in addition  the company is subject to rapid technological change  competition from substantially larger competitors  a limited family of products and other related risks  as more thoroughly described in the factors that could affect future results section of the company s form k for the year ended december  as a result  the company found the evidence described above to be the most reliable objective evidence available in determining that a valuation allowance against its tax assets would be necessary 
significant management judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
management is unsure whether the company will have sufficient future taxable income to allow it to use all net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on management s estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance 
establishing new or additional valuation allowances could materially adversely impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
pursuant to the tax reform act of  the utilization of nol carryforwards for tax purposes may be subject to an annual limitation if a cumulative change of ownership of more than occurs over a three year period 
as of december   the company has recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately  reflecting the benefit of deductions from the exercise of stock options 
when and if the company realizes the asset  the benefit from this  will be recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital when realized 
as of december   concord s principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the company believes that its current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
table of contents and cash provided by future operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
although operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent concord experiences growth in the future  its operating and investing activities may require additional cash 
consequently  any such future growth may require concord to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a market and interest rate risk most of concord s current export sales are denominated in united states dollars 
to the extent that a majority of our international sales continue to be denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could make our products and services more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive in international markets 
substantially all of our business outside the united states is conducted in us dollar denominated transactions  whereas our operating expenses in our international branches are denominated in local currency 
we believe that the operating expenses of our foreign operations are immaterial  and therefore any associated market risk is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
all of the company s investments are in investment grade securities with high credit ratings of relatively short duration that trade in highly liquid markets and are carried at fair value on the company s books 
accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe we have minimal market risk 
the company s investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but the company believes this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
b foreign currency exchange rate risk we use forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates underlying the value of accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies held until such receivables are collected 
a forward contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates 
these forward contracts  to qualify as hedges of existing assets  are denominated in the same currency in which the underlying foreign currency receivables are denominated and bear a contract value and maturity date that approximate the value and expected settlement date  respectively  of the underlying transactions 
for contracts that are designated and effective as hedges  unrealized gains and losses on open contracts at the end of each accounting period  resulting from changes in the fair value of these contracts  are recognized in earnings in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying foreign denominated receivables are recognized and generally offset 
we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes  and we only enter into contracts with highly rated financial institutions 
at december   we had one forward contract outstanding  which is presented in the table below 
the notional exchange rate is quoted using market conventions where the currency is expressed in currency units per us dollar 
fair market maturity notional notional value as of currency position date amount exchange rate december  euro sell   we plan to continue to utilize forward contracts and other instruments in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations from accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies  and we may not be able to do this successfully 
accordingly  we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
also  as we continue to expand our operations outside of the united states  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could increase
