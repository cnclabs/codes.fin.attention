item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under the caption entitled item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
headwaters fiscal year ends on september and unless otherwise noted  future references to years refer to headwaters fiscal year rather than a calendar year 
acquisitions of isg and hti and segments the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of headwaters and all of its subsidiaries  only two of which have significant operations  isg and hti 
all significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation 
isg was acquired on september  and accordingly  isg s results of operations for the period from september  through september  have been consolidated with headwaters and results 
hti was acquired in august due to the time required to obtain accurate financial information related to hti s foreign contracts  for financial reporting purposes hti s financial statements are consolidated with headwaters financial statements using a one month lag 
accordingly  no results of operations of hti were included in the consolidated statement of income for hti s august  and balance sheets were consolidated with headwaters september  and balance sheets and hti s results of operations for the twelve months ended august  and were consolidated with headwaters and results 
isg acquisition 
on september   headwaters acquired of the common stock of isg  assumed or paid off all of isg s outstanding debt and redeemed all of isg s outstanding preferred stock 
isg is the leading provider of high quality fly ash to the building products and ready mix concrete industries in the united states 
isg also develops  manufactures and distributes value added bagged concrete  stucco  mortar and block products that utilize fly ash through its construction materials segment 
headwaters historical focus has been on using technology to add value to fossil fuels  particularly coal 
the acquisition of isg provided headwaters with a significant position in the last phase of the coal value chain due to isg s competencies in managing ccps 
the acquisition of isg also brought to headwaters substantial management depth  comprehensive corporate infrastructure and critical mass in revenues and operating income 
in order to obtain the cash necessary to acquire isg and retire the isg debt  headwaters issued million of new debt consisting of million of senior secured debt with a five year term and a variable interest rate and million of subordinated debt with an approximate five year term and a fixed interest rate see note to the consolidated financial statements 
isg management participated in one half  or million  of the subordinated debt 
total cash proceeds from the issuance of new debt  net of debt discounts  was million 
headwaters also incurred approximately million of debt issuance costs to place the new debt  which had an initial combined effective weighted average interest rate of approximately 
the total consideration paid for isg was million and is described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the isg acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as required by sfas no 
 business combinations 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of september  approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to identifiable intangible assets consisting primarily of contracts with coal fired electric power generation plants and patents 
this amount is being amortized over the estimated combined useful life of years 
the remaining purchase price not attributable to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets was allocated to goodwill  none of which is tax deductible 
all of the intangible assets and all of the goodwill were allocated to the ccp segment 
hti acquisition 
in august  headwaters acquired of the common stock of hti  a new jersey based company 
hti s activities are directed at catalyst technologies to convert coal and heavy oil into environmentally friendly  higher value liquid fuels  as well as nanocatalyst processes and applications 
the total consideration paid for hti was million and is described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the hti acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to identifiable intangible assets consisting of existing patented technology with an estimated useful life of years 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to purchased in process research and development  consisting primarily of efforts focused on developing catalysts and catalytic processes to lower the cost of producing synthetic fuels and chemicals while improving energy efficiency and reducing environmental risks 
this amount represented projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative use as of the acquisition date  and was expensed in segments 
until headwaters acquired isg in september  headwaters operated in and reported as a single industry segment  alternative energy 
with the acquisition of isg  headwaters now operates in three business segments  alternative energy  ccps  and construction materials 
these segments are managed and evaluated separately by management based on fundamental differences in their operations  products and services 
the alternative energy segment includes headwaters traditional coal based solid synthetic fuels business and hti s business of developing catalyst technologies to convert coal and heavy oil into environmentally friendly  higher value liquid fuels as well as nanocatalyst processes and applications 
revenues for this segment primarily include sales of chemical reagents and license fees 
the ccp segment includes isg s business of providing fly ash to the building products and ready mix concrete industries 
this segment markets coal combustion products such as fly ash and bottom ash  known as ccps 
isg has long term contracts  primarily with coal fired electric power generation plants  pursuant to which it manages the post combustion operations for the utilities 
isg markets ccps to replace manufactured or mined materials  such as portland cement  lime  agricultural gypsum  fired lightweight aggregate  granite aggregate and limestone 
ccp revenues consist primarily of the sale of products  with a small amount of service revenue 
the construction materials segment manufactures and distributes value added bagged concrete  stucco  mortar and block products 
isg has introduced high volumes of ccps as substitute ingredients in the products the construction materials segment produces 
critical accounting policies and estimates headwaters significant accounting policies are identified and described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
headwaters continually evaluates its policies and estimation procedures 
estimates are often based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  but which could change in the future 
some of headwaters accounting policies and estimation procedures require the use of substantial judgment  and actual results could differ materially from the estimates underlying the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
such policies and estimation procedures have been reviewed with headwaters audit committee 
the following is a discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates 
license fee revenue recognition 
headwaters currently licenses its technologies to the owners of of a company estimated coal based solid synthetic fuel facilities in the united states 
recurring license fees or royalty payments are recognized in the period when earned  which generally coincides with the sale of synthetic fuel by headwaters licensees 
in most instances  headwaters receives timely reports from licensees notifying headwaters of the amount of solid synthetic fuel sold and the royalty due headwaters under the terms of the respective license fee agreements 
additionally  headwaters has experienced a regular pattern of payment by these licensees of the reported amounts 
generally  estimates of license fee revenue earned  where required  can be reliably made based upon historical experience and or communications from licensees for whom an established pattern exists 
in some cases  however  such as when a licensee is beginning to produce and sell synthetic fuel or when a synthetic fuel facility is sold by a licensee to another entity  and for which there is no pattern or knowledge of past or current production and sales activity  there may be more limited information upon which to estimate the license fee revenue earned 
in these situations  headwaters uses such information as is available and where possible  substantiates the information through such procedures as observing the levels of chemical reagents purchased by the licensee and used in the production of the solid synthetic fuel 
in certain limited situations  headwaters is unable to reliably estimate the license fee revenues earned during a period  and therefore revenue recognition is delayed until a future date when sufficient information is known from which to make a reasonable estimation 
realizability of receivables 
allowances are provided for uncollectible accounts and notes receivable when deemed necessary 
such allowances are based on an account by account analysis of collectibility or impairment 
collateral is not required for trade receivables  but headwaters performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers 
collateral is generally required for notes receivable and has historically consisted of most or all assets of the debtor 
with regard to headwaters trade receivables from the alternative energy segment  past allowances have been minimal as have any required write offs 
trade receivables from the ccp and construction materials segments involve substantially more customers  and receivable allowances are required 
headwaters reviews the collectibility of its trade receivables as of the end of each reporting period 
net losses recognized on notes receivable were approximately million in  million in and million in notes receivable generally relate to nonoperating activities and accordingly  losses are included in other expense in the consolidated statements of income 
the losses on notes receivable in consisted entirely of write offs or impairments of notes from unrelated  high risk entities to which headwaters loaned funds in late fiscal and early fiscal  which amounts were determined to be uncollectible or worthless 
headwaters no longer makes these loans  and in september  headwaters sold all its remaining loans and equity investments in these entities to a limited liability company  in exchange for a million note receivable  due no later than september this note is being accounted for on the cost recovery basis 
headwaters reviews collectibility of this note receivable at the end of each reporting period 
this collectibility review consists of consideration of payments of required interest and principal and the sufficiency of the collateral to support the outstanding note receivable balance 
if an impairment is indicated  headwaters writes down the note receivable to its estimated net realizable value 
impairment losses of approximately million and million were recorded in and  respectively  due to declines in the value of the underlying collateral  which management deemed other than temporary  during those periods 
headwaters considers its receivable allowances adequate as of september   however  changes in economic conditions generally or in specific markets in which headwaters operates could have a material effect on required reserve balances 
valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets consist primarily of identifiable intangible assets obtained in connection with the acquisitions of isg long term contracts and patents and hti existing patented technology 
these intangible assets are being amortized on the straight line method over their remaining estimated useful lives 
goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price for isg and hti over the fair value of identified assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  but is tested at least annually for impairment 
goodwill is normally tested as of june  using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit giving rise to the goodwill 
headwaters periodically evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or to the useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to headwaters business model or changes in headwaters capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from headwaters current estimates 
in those cases where headwaters determines that the useful life of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets should be shortened  headwaters would amortize the net book value in excess of salvage value over its revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation or amortization expense 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flow from that asset is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
there were no impairment losses recorded for long lived assets in any of the years presented 
indicators of impairment include such things as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate or an expectation that significant assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 headwaters does not amortize goodwill 
sfas no 
requires headwaters to periodically perform tests for goodwill impairment 
step of the initial impairment test was required to be performed no later than march   thereafter impairment testing is required to be performed no less often than annually  or sooner if evidence of possible impairment arises 
impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level and headwaters has identified four reporting units i the covol fuels division and ii hti which together comprise the alternative energy segment  iii ccps and iv construction materials 
currently  goodwill exists only in the ccps and hti reporting units 
step of impairment testing consists of determining and comparing the fair values of the reporting units to the carrying values of those reporting units 
if step were to be failed for either the ccps or hti reporting units  indicating a potential impairment  headwaters would be required to complete step  which is a more detailed test to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill  and compare that value to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is required to be recorded 
headwaters performed step impairment tests of the recorded goodwill in the ccps and hti reporting units as of october   the beginning of fiscal year headwaters performed its annual  recurring tests for potential impairment using the date of june  the tests indicated that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of both october  and june  accordingly  step of the impairment tests was not required to be performed  and no impairment charge was necessary 
it is possible that some of headwaters tangible or intangible long lived assets or goodwill could be impaired in the future and that the resulting write downs could be material 
legal matters 
headwaters and its subsidiaries are involved in several legal proceedings and contractual matters that have arisen in the normal course of business  all as explained in more detail in item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
management in all cases intends to vigorously defend headwaters position 
in regards to all of the unsettled legal matters  legal counsel cannot express an opinion as to the ultimate amount of recovery or liability 
management does not believe that the outcome of these matters will have a significant adverse effect upon the operations  cash flows or the financial position of headwaters  however  it is possible that a change in management s estimates of probable liability could occur  and the change could be significant 
in accounting for legal matters  headwaters follows the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  under which loss contingencies are accounted for based upon the likelihood of an impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability 
if a loss contingency is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  it is accrued 
if a loss contingency is probable  but the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated  or if a loss contingency is reasonably possible  disclosure is made 
loss contingencies that are remote are neither accounted for nor disclosed 
gain contingencies are given no accounting recognition  but are disclosed if material 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares headwaters operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
revenue 
total revenue for increased by million or to million as compared to million for the major components of revenue are discussed in the sections below 
sales of chemical reagents 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in chemical reagent sales during was due to increased synthetic fuel production by headwaters licensees  as well as sales of chemical reagents to new customers with which headwaters does not have a license agreement 
license fees 
during  headwaters recognized license fee revenue totaling million  an increase of million or over million of license fee revenue recognized during license fees in consisted of recurring license fees or royalty payments of million and deferred revenue amortization of million 
license fees in consisted of recurring license fees of million and deferred revenue amortization of million 
the primary reason for the increase in license fee revenue in compared to was a major licensee that purchased four facilities from a former licensee in october  but did not begin operating those facilities until early calendar headwaters earned approximately million in license fees from this licensee in and million in pursuant to the contractual terms of an agreement with a certain licensee  the cumulative license fees owed to headwaters have been placed in escrow for the benefit of headwaters pending resolution of certain contingencies 
headwaters currently expects the escrowed amounts to increase as additional license fees are generated and that most  if not all  of such amounts will be recognized as revenue at some future date 
as of september   the license fees  net of anticipated expenses  total approximately million 
certain accounting rules governing revenue recognition require that the seller s price to the buyer be fixed or determinable as well as reasonably certain of collection 
in this situation  those rules appear to currently preclude revenue recognition 
accordingly  none of the escrowed amounts have been recognized as revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
in addition to these escrowed amounts  this same licensee has also set aside substantial amounts for various operational contingencies as provided for in the contractual agreements 
these reserves  if not needed  will eventually be paid out to various parties having an interest in the cash flows from the licensee s operations  including headwaters 
as a result  headwaters currently expects to receive at some future date a portion of those reserves  the amount of which is not currently determinable and therefore  not recognizable 
isg revenues and cost of revenues 
ccp revenues and sales of construction materials and the related cost of revenue captions represent isg s revenues and cost of revenues 
because isg was purchased on september   there were only days of operations included in compared to a full year in depreciation and amortization 
these costs increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization of isg s tangible and intangible assets 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of additional costs relating to isg s research and development activities 
in  research and development expenses represented primarily costs related to hti s activities  which remained relatively unchanged during selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased million to million for from million for the increase in was due primarily to the inclusion of isg s costs  and to a lesser extent  an increase in professional services expenses of approximately million related to legal actions in which headwaters is currently involved 
other income and expense 
during  headwaters reported net other expense of million compared to net other expense of million during the change of million was attributable to i an increase in interest expense of million  ii a decrease in interest income of million  and iii an increase in net losses on notes receivable and investments of million  substantially offset by an increase in net other income of million 
interest expense increased in due to the substantial increase in debt incurred in september to finance the acquisition of isg 
interest expense in includes million related to accelerated amortization of debt discount and debt issue costs associated with million of early repayments of senior debt principal 
interest income decreased from to primarily due to lower average balances of cash and short term investments as a result of headwaters using a substantial amount of cash to purchase isg and applying available cash generated in to repay long term debt 
lower interest rates in also affected interest income 
losses on notes receivable were million higher in as compared to in both years  the majority of the losses represented write downs of a note receivable which is being accounted for on the cost recovery method 
the write downs in both years were necessary due to declines in the value of the underlying collateral 
the carrying value of this note receivable at september  was million 
in  headwaters also recorded a million loss on an investment 
net other income increased by million in compared to primarily due to two non recurring transactions in a million gain on sale of assets resulted from the sale of a interest in one of headwaters original synthetic fuel facilities 
also  headwaters recorded approximately million of losses related to the write off of deferred project financing costs resulting from the abandonment of certain projects or the postponement or redirection of activities for which costs had previously been deferred 
income tax provision 
in  headwaters recorded an income tax provision at an effective tax rate of approximately 
in  the effective tax rate was approximately 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares headwaters operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
revenue 
total revenue for increased by million or to million as compared to million for the major components of revenue are discussed in the sections below 
sales of chemical reagents 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in chemical reagent sales in over was due to increased synthetic fuel production by headwaters licensees  as well as sales of chemical reagents to new customers 
license fees 
during  headwaters recognized license fee revenue totaling million  an increase of million or over million of license fee revenue recognized during license fees in consisted of recurring license fees or royalty payments of million and deferred revenue amortization of million 
license fees in consisted of recurring license fees of million and deferred revenue amortization of million 
a major licensee significantly reduced its production and sale of synthetic fuel in early and did not operate its four facilities for most of this licensee sold the facilities in october  and headwaters earned approximately million more in license fees from these facilities in than in this factor  combined with increased synthetic fuel sales by most other licensees  caused the increase in license fee revenue for over other revenues and cost of revenues 
ccp revenues and sales of construction materials and the related cost of revenue captions represent isg s revenues and cost of revenues 
isg was purchased on september   and accordingly  there were only days of operations included in approximately million of other revenues and million of cost of other revenues represent hti s revenues and cost of revenues for there were no comparable revenues and cost of revenues for either isg or hti in depreciation and amortization 
these costs increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the depreciation and amortization of the tangible and intangible assets acquired in the hti acquisition in august million and the depreciation and amortization of the tangible and intangible assets acquired in the isg acquisition in september million 
research and development 
approximately million of the hti purchase price was allocated to purchased in process research and development  all of which was expensed in in  research and development expenses of million represented primarily million of costs related to hti activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased million or to million for from million for the increase in was due primarily to isg costs of approximately million  an increase in compensation related costs of approximately million  an increase in professional services expenses of approximately million and smaller increases in most of the other expense categories 
the increase in compensation related costs related primarily to an increase in incentive based pay as a result of improved operating results 
the increase in professional services expenses was due primarily to legal costs associated with legal actions in which headwaters is currently involved 
the increases in other expense categories were due primarily to the growth of headwaters business during other income and expense 
during  headwaters reported net other expenses of million compared to net other expenses of million during the change of million or is primarily attributable to i an increase in interest and net investment income of million  ii a decrease in equity and debt investment related losses of approximately million  and iii a gain on the sale of assets of approximately million  partially offset by the write off of deferred project financing costs of approximately million and an increase in interest expense of approximately million 
the increase in interest income from to was primarily related to an increase in the average balance of short term investments in over  partially offset by a decrease in interest income from a million note receivable from a licensee that was collected in october during  headwaters made several equity investments in and loans to unrelated  high risk entities  and in  headwaters recorded losses totaling approximately million related to write offs of these investments and loans 
in september  headwaters sold all of its remaining high risk investments in exchange for a million note receivable from a limited liability corporation 
headwaters wrote down this note receivable as of september  and recorded an impairment loss of approximately million in due to a decline in the value of the underlying collateral 
the million gain on sale of assets resulted from the sale of a interest in one of headwaters original synthetic fuel facilities 
headwaters recorded approximately million of losses related to the write off of deferred project financing costs in resulting from the abandonment of certain projects or the postponement or redirection of activities for which costs had previously been deferred pending the ultimate outcome of the projects and activities 
interest expense increased in due to the substantial increase in outstanding debt incurred in september to finance the acquisition of isg 
income taxes 
in  headwaters reported a net income tax benefit of million  consisting of the recognition of million of its deferred tax asset  reduced by million of federal alternative minimum tax and million of current state income tax expense 
in  as a result of recording the full value of its deferred tax asset in  headwaters recorded an income tax provision with an effective tax rate of approximately 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations during the fiscal year ended september  was million compared to million of net cash provided by operations during the fiscal year ended september  
most of the cash flow from operating activities in both periods was attributable to net income 
consistent with headwaters strategic priority to repay debt and de leverage its balance sheet  headwaters used most of the cash generated during the year ended september  to repay debt 
during  investing activities consisted primarily of payments for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and proceeds from disposition of property  plant and equipment 
investing activities in consisted primarily of cash payments for the acquisition of isg of million and the collection of a million note receivable 
financing activities in both and consisted primarily of proceeds from and repayments of long term debt and short term borrowings  and proceeds from exercise of options  warrants and employee stock purchases 
more details about these activities are provided in the following paragraphs 
operating activities 
cash provided from operations in of million resulted primarily from net income of million plus depreciation and amortization of million 
investing activities 
in  payments for the purchase of property  plant and equipment totaled million 
these capital expenditures primarily related to isg s business  in particular the ccp segment 
capital expenditures for are expected to be comparable with levels 
in september  headwaters sold all of its remaining high risk investments in exchange for a million note receivable from a limited liability corporation 
this note is due no later than september  is collateralized by the bridge loans and equity investments sold and is being accounted for on the cost recovery method 
in  headwaters recorded a million write down of this note and as of september  this note has a carrying value of million 
headwaters could incur additional losses if the remaining balance on the note is not repaid or if the collateral value declines 
at september   headwaters had outstanding one other note receivable in the amount of million 
this note and the related accrued interest were collected in financing activities 
headwaters acquired isg in september in order to obtain the cash necessary to acquire isg and retire the isg debt  headwaters issued million of new debt consisting of million of senior secured debt and million of subordinated debt see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  principal repayments of the senior debt totaling million were made  including million of optional prepayments 
subsequent to september  and through november   principal repayments totaling million have been made  including optional prepayments of million 
in  cash proceeds from the exercise of options  warrants and employee stock purchases totaled million  compared to million in option and warrant exercise activity is largely dependent on headwaters stock price and is not predictable 
to the extent non qualified stock options are exercised  or there are disqualifying dispositions of shares obtained upon the exercise of incentive stock options  headwaters receives a tax benefit generally equal to the income recognized by the optionee 
such amounts  reflected in cash flows from operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows  were million in and million in headwaters intends to continue to expand its business through growth of existing operations  commercialization of technologies currently being developed  and strategic acquisitions of entities that operate in adjacent industries 
currently the senior secured credit facility requires approval for acquisitions funded with aggregate cash consideration in excess of million 
headwaters has an effective million universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec that can be used for the sale of common stock  preferred stock  convertible debt and other securities 
the most likely use of the shelf registration statement would be to issue equity securities to reduce long term debt and for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
a prospectus supplement describing the terms of any securities to be issued is required to be filed before any offering would commence under the registration statement 
working capital 
headwaters working capital decreased by million from september   to million as of september  the most significant changes in the components of working capital were an increase of million in cash and investments and an increase of million in the current portion of long term debt  reflecting senior debt repayment obligations that are higher for than for headwaters expects operations to produce positive cash flows in future periods  which  combined with current working capital and the million revolving line of credit described below  is expected to be sufficient for operating needs for the next months 
long term debt 
in connection with the isg acquisition  headwaters entered into a million senior secured credit agreement with a syndication of lenders  under which a total of million was borrowed as a term loan on the acquisition date 
the credit agreement also allows up to million to be borrowed under a revolving credit arrangement 
the debt was issued at a discount and headwaters received net cash proceeds of million 
the original issue discount is being accreted using the effective interest method and the accretion is recorded as interest expense 
the debt is secured by all assets of headwaters  bears interest at a variable rate approximately at september   and is repayable in quarterly installments through august in  principal repayments totaling million were made  which included million of optional early repayments 
subsequent to september  and through november   principal repayments totaling million were made  which included early repayments of million 
in certain situations  for example when headwaters receives excess cash flow  as defined  mandatory prepayments in excess of the scheduled payments are required 
mandatory prepayments are calculated as a percentage of excess cash flow  ranging up to  which percentage is based on headwaters leverage ratio 
when prepayments are made  required principal repayments for all future periods are reduced 
headwaters may  in the future  make additional optional prepayments of the senior debt depending on actual cash flows  headwaters current and expected cash requirements and other factors deemed significant by management 
the credit agreement contains restrictions and covenants common to such agreements  including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt  investments  merger and acquisition activity  asset liens  capital expenditures in excess of million in any fiscal year and the payment of dividends  among others 
in addition  headwaters must maintain certain financial ratios  including leverage ratios and in respect of interest coverage  as those terms are defined in the credit agreement 
as of september   headwaters must maintain a total leverage ratio of or less 
the maximum ratio declines over time until june   at which time the ratio must remain at or less 
there is a similar leverage ratio requirement for the senior debt alone  which at september  must be or less  declining over time through june   at which time it must be maintained at or less 
the interest coverage requirement at september  was or more 
beginning december   the ratio must be maintained at a level of or more 
headwaters is in compliance with all debt covenants 
under the terms of the senior secured credit agreement  headwaters may borrow up to a total of million  provided however  except for the initial million of available revolving credit  the maximum borrowing limit is permanently reduced by the amount of any repayments of the initial million term loan borrowed in september terms of any additional borrowings under the credit agreement are generally the same as those described in the preceding paragraphs 
finally  the credit agreement allows for the issuance of letters of credit  provided there is capacity under the revolving credit arrangement 
currently two letters of credit totaling million are outstanding  with expiration dates in march and november there have been no other letters of credit issued and no funds have been borrowed under the revolving credit arrangement 
headwaters pays a fee of on the unused portion of the revolving credit arrangement 
in connection with the isg acquisition  headwaters also entered into a million subordinated loan agreement  under which senior subordinated debentures were issued at a discount  with headwaters receiving net cash proceeds of million 
the original issue discount is being accreted using the effective interest method and the accretion is recorded as interest expense 
isg management participated in one half  or million  of the million of debt issued 
the other half was issued to a corporation 
the debt is not secured  bears interest at a rate of per annum payable quarterly  and is due on september  it is senior to all other debt except the senior secured debt described previously 
the debt agreement allows for optional prepayments 
any prepayments paid to the corporation are subject to a prepayment charge  which ranges from of the principal prepaid in the first year to of the principal prepaid in the last year of the five year term of the subordinated loan agreement 
the loan agreement contains restrictions and covenants common to such agreements  and these are generally consistent with those described above for the senior secured debt 
as of september   headwaters must maintain a total leverage ratio of or less 
the maximum ratio declines over time until june  at which time the ratio must remain at or less 
the interest coverage requirement at september  was or more 
beginning in december  the ratio must be maintained at a level of or more 
headwaters is in compliance with all debt covenants 
income taxes 
in  headwaters cash requirements for income taxes were not significant due to the availability and utilization of net operating loss carryforwards nols 
most of headwaters nols were utilized in and  accordingly  cash requirements for income taxes were significant  totaling million 
cash payments for income taxes are reduced for disqualifying dispositions of shares obtained upon the exercise of stock options as discussed previously which totaled million for as of september   remaining nols are not material 
headwaters cash requirements for income taxes in are expected to approximate the income tax provision  with some lag due to the seasonality of operations and because estimated income tax payments are typically based on annualizing the fiscal year s income based on year to date results 
summary of future cash requirements 
significant future cash needs  in addition to operational working capital requirements  are currently expected to consist primarily of debt service payments on outstanding long term debt  income taxes and capital expenditures 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments other than operating leases for certain equipment and real estate  headwaters has no significant off balance sheet transactions  derivatives or similar instruments and is not a guarantor of any third party debt or other financial obligations 
the following table presents a summary of headwaters contractual obligations by period as of september  payments due by period after millions of dollars total year years years years senior secured debt senior subordinated debt other long term debt total long term debt operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations capital expenditures other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations subsequent to september   one of isg s minimum purchase contracts was amended 
the amendment extended the term of the contract for several years and increased isg s total future minimum purchase requirements by approximately million during through under the terms of the senior secured credit agreement  headwaters may borrow up to a total of million  provided however  except for the initial million of available revolving credit  the maximum borrowing limit is permanently reduced by the amount of any repayments of the initial million borrowed in september the credit agreement allows for the issuance of letters of credit  provided there is capacity under the available revolving credit arrangement 
currently  two letters of credit totaling million are outstanding  with expiration dates in march and november there have been no other letters of credit issued and no funds have been borrowed under the revolving credit arrangement 
as indicated previously  headwaters and its subsidiaries are involved in several legal proceedings and contractual matters that have arisen in the normal course of business  all as explained in more detail in critical accounting policies and estimates legal matters  above  item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
senate permanent subcommittee on investigations on october   the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the government affairs committee of the united states issued a notification of pending investigations 
the notification listed the synthetic fuel tax credit as a new item  stating the subcommittee has initiated an investigation of potential abuses of tax credits by producers of synthetic fuel under section of the internal revenue code 
the subcommittee anticipates that this investigation will focus on whether certain synthetic fuel producers are claiming tax credits under section  even though their product is not a qualified synthetic fuel under section and irs regulations 
in addition  the investigation will address whether certain corporations are engaging in transactions solely to take advantage of unused section credits  with no other business purpose 
lastly  the investigation will address the irs s efforts to curb abuses related to the section tax credits 
the effect that the senate subcommittee investigation of synthetic fuel tax credits may have on the industry is unknown 
while the investigation is pending  buyers may be unwilling to engage in transactions to purchase synthetic fuel facilities 
if current owners are unable to sell their facilities  production may not be maximized  materially adversely affecting headwaters revenues 
recent accounting pronouncements headwaters has reviewed all recently issued accounting standards  which have not yet been adopted in order to determine their potential effect  if any  on the results of operations or financial position of headwaters 
based on that review  headwaters does not currently believe that any of these recent accounting pronouncements will have a significant effect on its current or future financial position  results of operations  cash flows or disclosures 
impact of inflation headwaters operations were not materially impacted by inflation in forward looking statements statements in this annual report on form k regarding headwaters expectations as to the managing and marketing of coal combustion products  operation of facilities utilizing alternative fuel technologies  the marketing of synthetic fuels  the receipt of licensing fees  royalties  and product sales revenues  the development  commercialization and financing of new technologies and other strategic business opportunities and acquisitions and other information about headwaters that is not purely historical by nature  including those statements regarding headwaters future business plans  the operation of facilities  the availability of tax credits  the availability of feedstocks  and the marketability of the coal combustion products and synthetic fuel  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of although headwaters believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from its expectations 
in addition to matters affecting the coal combustion products and synthetic fuel industries or the economy generally  factors which could cause actual results to differ from expectations stated in these forward looking statements include  among others  the risk factors described in the following section 
risk factors the profitability of covol fuels depends on the continued existence of tax credits under section of the internal revenue code  which is scheduled to expire on december  covol fuels license fees and revenues from sales of chemical reagents depend on the ability of our licensees and customers to manufacture and sell qualified synthetic fuels that generate tax credits 
under current law  section tax credits are not available for synthetic fuel sold after december  in addition  there have been initiatives from time to time to consider the early repeal or modification of section if section expires at the end of or if it is repealed or adversely modified  synthetic fuel facilities would probably either close or substantially curtail production 
at this time  given current prices of coal and costs of synthetic fuel production  we do not believe that production of synthetic fuel will be profitable absent the tax credits 
in addition  if our licensees close their facilities or materially reduce production activities whether after  upon earlier repeal or adverse modification of section or for any other reason  it would have a material adverse effect on the revenues and net income of headwaters 
furthermore  section tax credits are subject to phase out after the unregulated oil price reaches per barrel the current trading price is approximately per barrel  adjusted annually for inflation 
ongoing financial profitability of covol fuels depends upon our licensees demand for section tax credits  which in turn depends on our licensees taxable income 
covol fuels business depends upon the ability of our licensees and chemical reagent customers to utilize section tax credits 
their ability to utilize tax credits  in turn  depends upon their other taxable income 
a decline in the profitability of our licensees could reduce their ability to utilize tax credits  and  in turn  could lead to a reduction in the production of synthetic fuel at their facilities 
such licensees could sell their facilities to a taxpayer with more capacity to utilize the tax credits  but any such transfer could result in short term or long term disruption of operations 
accordingly  the decline in profitability of our licensees or chemical reagent customers could have a material adverse effect on the revenues and net income of headwaters 
irs reviews under section may adversely affect our licensees production of synthetic fuel 
the issuance of plrs under section by the irs is important to the willingness of the owners of synthetic fuel facilities to operate and to their ability to transfer ownership of those facilities 
however  plrs may be modified or revoked by the irs 
the irs has suspended the issuance of plrs to synthetic fuel facility owners several times in the past  and there can be no assurance that the irs will not suspend the issuance of plrs in the future 
most recently  in june  the irs stated in summary in announcement that it has had reason to question the scientific validity of test procedures and results that have been presented as evidence that fuel underwent a significant chemical change  and is currently reviewing information regarding these test procedures and results  and that pending its review of the issue it was suspending the issuance of new plrs regarding significant chemical change 
the irs release of announcement caused certain of headwaters licensees to reduce or cease synthetic fuel production  which resulted in a material adverse impact on headwaters revenues and net income 
in october  the irs stated  in summary  in announcement that it continues to question whether the processes it had approved under its long standing ruling practice produce the necessary level of chemical change required under section and revenue ruling nonetheless  the irs indicated that it would continue to issue plrs regarding chemical change under the standards set forth in revenue procedures and  and that the industry s chemical change test procedures and results are scientifically valid if applied in a consistent and unbiased manner 
although the irs resumed its practice of issuing plrs  it expressed continuing concerns regarding the sampling and data record retention practices prevalent in the synthetic fuels industry 
the full effect that announcement or future suspensions or pronouncements similar to announcement may have on the industry is unknown 
the expression of irs concern regarding current practices in the industry may have a material adverse effect on the willingness of buyers to engage in transactions or on the willingness of current owners to operate their facilities 
if current owners are unable to sell their facilities or are unwilling to operate them  production will not be maximized  materially adversely affecting our revenues and net income 
we cannot predict whether the irs may conduct reviews or investigations of section tax credits in the future  or whether the outcome of irs audits involving licensees would be favorable 
senate investigation of section tax credits may adversely affect covol fuels 
on october   the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the government affairs committee of the united states senate issued a notification of pending investigations 
the notification listed  among others  the synthetic fuel tax credit as a new item  stating the subcommittee has initiated an investigation of potential abuses of tax credits for producers of synthetic fuel under section of the internal revenue code 
the subcommittee anticipates that this investigation will focus on whether certain synthetic fuel producers are claiming tax credits under section  even though their product is not a qualified synthetic fuel under section and irs regulations 
in addition  the investigation will address whether certain corporations are engaging in transactions solely to take advantage of unused section credits  with no other business purpose 
lastly  the investigation will address the irs s efforts to curb abuses related to the section tax credits 
the effect that the senate subcommittee investigation of synthetic fuel tax credits may have on the industry is unknown 
while the investigation is pending  it may have a material adverse effect on the willingness of buyers to engage in transactions to purchase synthetic fuel facilities or on the willingness of current owners to operate their facilities  and may materially adversely affect our revenues and net income 
we cannot make any assurances as to the timing or ultimate outcome of the subcommittee investigation  nor can we predict whether congress or others may conduct investigations of section tax credits in the future 
covol fuels licensees are subject to audit by the irs  and the irs may challenge or disallow section tax credits claimed 
licensees are subject to audit by the irs 
the irs may challenge whether covol fuels licensees satisfy the requirements of section  or applicable plrs  or may attempt to disallow section tax credits for some other reason 
headwaters understands that the irs has recently initiated audits of certain taxpayers who claimed section tax credits during open tax years  and the outcome of any such audit is uncertain 
in the event that tax credits are disallowed  licensees may seek recovery from covol fuels for operational or other reasons  although we believe there would be no basis for such claims 
the inability of a licensee to claim section tax credits also would reduce our future income from the licensee 
in addition  irs audit activity may have a material adverse effect on the willingness of buyers to engage in transactions to purchase synthetic fuel facilities or on the willingness of current owners to operate their facilities 
if current owners are unable to sell their facilities or are unwilling to operate them at full capacity  production will not be maximized  materially adversely affecting our revenues and net income 
demand for section tax credits may be influenced by negative publicity involving the industry or transactions principally motivated by the reduction of taxes 
there has been recent public scrutiny  by the media and by policymakers  of section outside the section context  there has been increased public scrutiny of transactions motivated principally by the reduction of federal income taxes 
our licensees could determine that the risk of negative publicity or public scrutiny associated with the section tax credits exceeds the financial benefits from the utilization of the credits 
such licensees may seek to mitigate or eliminate such risk by reducing or ceasing production of synthetic fuel or disposing of their facilities  resulting in short term or long term disruption of operations  in which case our revenues could be materially adversely affected 
ongoing financial profitability of covol fuels depends on a small number of licensees 
covol fuels has licensed its coal based solid synthetic fuel technology to a limited number of licensees 
under current law  facilities must have been placed into service prior to july  to be eligible for section tax credits  so covol fuels business primarily depends on existing licensees and chemical reagent customers 
if any of covol fuels significant licensees or chemical reagent customers shuts down its facilities  operates its facilities at low production levels or sells its facilities resulting in short term or long term disruption of operations  our revenues and net income could be materially adversely affected 
covol fuels licensees must address all operational issues including  but not limited to  feedstock availability  cost  moisture content  btu content  correct chemical reagent formulation and application  operability of equipment  product durability and overall costs of operations 
in some cases  licensees may be forced to relocate plants and enter into new strategic contracts to address marketing and operational issues 
licensee plant relocations disrupt production and delay generation of license fees paid to us 
the growth of covol fuels revenues has depended in part on increased production over time of coal based solid synthetic fuel by its licensees 
while to date efficiencies in production and improvements in equipment and processes used at facilities have allowed increased production  capacity is ultimately finite for the specific facilities and could limit growth in the future 
covol fuels must be able to develop and improve synthetic fuel technologies 
for covol fuels to remain competitive  we must be able to develop or refine our technologies to keep up with future synthetic fuel requirements 
as licensees develop and modify their operations and choices of coal feedstocks  we will need to modify existing methods or find new methods  know how  additives and other techniques to meet licensee and customer demands  such as demands for improved efficiencies  lower costs and improvements in synthetic fuel products  including chemical change and improved combustion characteristics 
if we are unable to develop or refine our technologies  the revenues and business of covol fuels could be materially harmed 
isg s growth is dependent upon increased use and market acceptance of fly ash 
isg s growth has been and continues to be dependent upon the increased use of fly ash in the production of concrete 
isg s marketing initiatives emphasize the environmental  cost and performance advantages of replacing portland cement with fly ash in the production of concrete 
if isg s marketing initiatives are not successful  isg may not be able to sustain its growth 
isg s business is dependent upon the price and supply of fly ash alternatives 
a significant portion of isg s business is based on the use of fly ash as a replacement for portland cement in concrete products 
there is currently an overcapacity of cement in the world market  causing potential price decreases 
the markets for isg s products are regional  in part because of the costs in transporting ccps  and isg s business is affected by the availability and cost of competing products in the specific regions where it conducts business 
if competing products become available at more competitive costs  isg s sales  revenue and net income could decrease 
isg s business could be adversely affected by fluctuations in weather and construction cycles 
isg manages and markets ccps and uses ccps to produce construction materials 
utilities produce ccps year round  including in the winter when electricity demands increase 
in comparison  sales of ccps are generally keyed to construction market demands that tend to follow national trends in construction with predictable increases during temperate seasons 
isg s ccp sales have historically reflected these seasonal trends  with the largest percentage of total annual revenues being realized in the quarters ended june and september low seasonal demand normally results in reduced shipments and revenues in the quarter ended march the ccp industry is cyclical because of its dependence on building construction and highway construction  including infrastructure repair  and is affected by changes in general and local economic conditions 
state construction budgets are affected adversely by economic downturns 
a downturn in the economy in one or more markets that isg serves could have a material adverse effect on isg s sales 
if isg s coal fired electric utility industry suppliers fail to provide isg with high quality ccps on a timely basis  isg s costs could increase and our growth could be hindered 
isg relies on the production of ccps by coal fired electric utilities 
isg has occasionally experienced delays and other problems in obtaining high quality ccps from its suppliers and may in the future be unable to obtain high quality ccps on the scale and within the time frames required by isg to meet its customers needs 
if isg is unable to obtain ccps  or if it experiences a delay in the delivery of high quality ccps  isg may be forced to incur significant unanticipated expenses to secure alternative sources or to otherwise maintain supply to its customers 
moreover  its revenues could be adversely affected if these customers choose to find alternatives to isg products 
hti s technologies may not be commercially developed and marketed profitably 
although hti has developed and patented several technologies  commercialization of these technologies is in initial stages 
market acceptance of these technologies will depend on our ability to enter into agreements with licensees or joint venturers to further develop and provide adequate funding to commercialize the technologies 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to enter into these agreements or that adequate funding will be available to fully develop and successfully commercialize its technologies or that they can be marketed profitably 
hti will conduct business in china  where intellectual property and other laws  as well as business conditions  could create risks 
hti has entered into agreements with shenhua group  the largest coal company in the people s republic of china  to license its direct coal liquefaction technology for use in a plant in china 
we have entered into a preliminary joint venture agreement for fuel cell technology development and commercialization with the dalian institute of chemical physics in china  using our nanotechnology 
in addition  other hti activities are likely to involve licensing of other technologies in china 
there is the risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as under united states laws  leaving us vulnerable to competitors who may attempt to copy our products  processes or technologies 
further  the legal system of china is based on statutory law 
under this system  prior court decisions may be cited as persuasive authority but do not have binding precedential effect 
since  the chinese government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws and considerable progress has been made in the promulgation of laws and regulations dealing with economic matters  such as corporate organization and governance  foreign investment  commerce  taxation and trade 
as these laws  regulations and legal requirements are relatively new and because of the limited volume of published case law and judicial interpretations and the non binding nature of prior court decisions  the interpretation and enforcement of these laws  regulations and legal requirements involve some uncertainty 
these uncertainties could limit the legal protection or recourse available to us 
in addition  dependence on foreign licenses and conducting foreign operations may subject us to increased risk from political change  ownership issues or repatriation or currency exchange concerns 
environmental regulations could adversely affect our business 
our operations and those of our suppliers and customers involved in coal based energy generation  primarily utilities  are subject to federal  state and local environmental regulation 
see item business effect of federal state and local laws for a broader discussion of regulation issues affecting headwaters 
the coal based solid synthetic fuel operations of headwaters and its licensees are subject to federal  state and local environmental regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment  storage and disposal of waste products 
in order to establish and operate the synthetic fuel plants  power plants and operations to collect and transport ccps and bottom ash  we and our licensees and customers have obtained various state and local permits and must comply with processes and procedures that have been approved by regulatory authorities 
compliance with permits  regulations and the approved processes and procedures help protect against pollution and contamination  and are critical to our business 
although we believe that we and our licensees and customers are in substantial compliance with environmental regulations  permits and approved processes and procedures  any failure to comply could result in the issuance of substantial fines and penalties and cause us to incur environmental liabilities 
the federal clean air act of and subsequent amendments particularly the clean air act amendments of  and corresponding state laws  regulate the emissions of materials into the air  and in certain circumstances require installation of emission control technologies that affect the operation of coal fired utility power plants 
current and future emission regulations may have an adverse impact on the quantity and quality of ccps produced by utilities and may add to the costs of operating a power plant 
because isg manages and markets ccps produced by coal fired utilities  regulations that restrict coal burning  or make it more expensive or affect the quantity and quality of ccps produced by utilities could adversely affect isg s business 
materials sold by isg vary in chemical composition 
while ccps generally have been excluded from regulation as hazardous wastes  the epa is planning to publish proposed rules in january which will address  among other things  state and regional solid waste plans for ccps disposed of in landfills or surface impoundments  or used to fill surface or underground mines 
these proposed rules could make coal burning more expensive or less attractive to isg s utility clients 
isg manages a number of landfill and pond operations that may be affected by epa s proposed regulations 
isg is engaged in providing services at one landfill operation that is permitted and managed as a hazardous waste landfill 
isg provides the services necessary to landfill the client s hazardous wastes and operates certain in plant equipment and systems for the client 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that isg will not be named in any third party claims relating to the project 
ccps contain small concentrations of metals that are considered as hazardous substances under cercla 
land application of ccps is regulated by a variety of federal and state statutes  which impose testing and management requirements to ensure environmental protection 
under certain circumstances  mismanagement of ccps could give rise to cercla liability 
hti s ordinary course of business requires using its facilities to perform research and development activities involving coal  oil  chemicals and energy technologies  including liquefaction of coal 
as a result  petroleum and other hazardous materials have been and are present in and on hti s properties 
regulatory noncompliance or accidental discharges  in spite of safeguards  could create an environmental liability 
therefore our operations entail risk of environmental damage  and we could incur liabilities in the future arising from the discharge of pollutants into the environment or from waste disposal practices 
we are involved in significant litigation and are subject to potential claims relating to our business 
we are a party to some significant legal proceedings and are subject to potential claims regarding operation of our business 
these proceedings will require that we incur substantial costs  including attorneys fees  managerial time and other personnel resources and costs in pursuing resolution 
adverse resolution of these proceedings could have a materially negative effect on our business 
see legal proceedings for a description of the material pending legal proceedings and potential claims regarding our business 
we have significant competition 
headwaters experiences competition from traditional coal and fuel suppliers and natural resource producers  in addition to those companies that specialize in the use and upgrading of industrial byproducts 
many of these companies have greater financial  management and other resources than headwaters and may be able to take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily 
there can be no assurance that headwaters will be able to do so successfully 
coal based solid synthetic fuels made using covol fuels technologies  from which covol fuels derives license revenues and revenues from sales of chemical reagents  compete with other synthetic fuel products  as well as traditional fuels 
for covol fuels competition may come in the form of the marketing of competitive chemical reagents and the marketing of end products qualifying as synthetic fuel 
covol fuels competes with other companies possessing technologies to produce coal based solid synthetic fuels and companies that produce chemical reagents such as nalco chemical company and accretion technologies  llc 
covol fuels also experiences competition from traditional coal and fuel suppliers and natural resource producers  in addition to those companies that specialize in the use and upgrading of industrial byproducts 
these companies may have greater financial  management and other resources than headwaters has 
further  many industrial coal users are limited in the amount of synthetic fuel product they can purchase from covol fuels licensees because they have committed to purchase a substantial portion of their coal requirements through long term contracts for standard coal 
synthetic fuel technology and the use of ccps are the subject of extensive research and development by our competitors 
if competitive technologies are developed that greatly increase the demand for ccps or reduce the costs of synthetic fuels or other resources  the economic viability of our technologies and business could be adversely affected 
generally  the business of marketing traditional ccps and construction materials is intensely competitive 
isg has substantial competition in three main areas obtaining ccp management contracts with utility and other industrial companies  marketing ccps and related industrial materials  and marketing its construction materials 
isg has a presence in every region in the united states  but because the market for the management of ccps is highly fragmented and because the costs of transportation are high relative to sales prices  most of the competition in the ccp management industry is regional 
there are many local  regional and national companies that compete for market share in these areas with similar products and with numerous other substitute products 
although isg typically has long term ccp management contracts with its clients  some of such contracts provide for the termination of such contract at the convenience of the utility company upon a minimum day notice 
moreover  certain of isg s most significant regional ccp competitors appear to be seeking a broader national presence 
these competitors include lafarge north america inc  boral material technologies inc 
and cemex 
construction materials are produced and sold regionally by the numerous owners and operators of concrete ready mix plants 
producers with sand and gravel sources near growing metropolitan areas have important transportation advantages 
in texas  isg s most important construction materials market  featherlite building products is among isg s competitors 
certain of these competitors have substantially greater resources than headwaters and isg 
if they were to begin to compete in the national market  or in regions where they currently do not have operations  isg s business may be materially adversely affected 
many of the world s major chemical companies are devoting significant resources to researching and developing nanocatalysts and catalytic processes 
these companies have greater financial  management and other resources than headwaters has 
headwaters strategy is to enter into license agreements or joint ventures with major chemical companies for the further development and commercialization of headwaters nanocatalyst technologies 
our business strategy to grow through acquisitions may not be successful 
an important business strategy of headwaters is growth through acquisitions 
our ability to successfully implement our strategy is subject to a number of risks  including difficulties in identifying acceptable acquisition candidates  consummating acquisitions on favorable terms and obtaining adequate financing  which may adversely affect our ability to develop new products and services and to compete in our rapidly changing marketplace 
in addition  if we consummate acquisitions through an exchange of our securities  our existing stockholders could suffer dilution 
successful management and integration of acquisitions are subject to a number of risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  including loss of key employees  diversion of management s attention from core business operations  assumption of contingent liabilities  and incurrence of potentially significant write offs 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our acquisition strategy  that such strategy will improve our operating results or that these activities will not have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders 
if we are unable to manage the growth of our business successfully  our revenues and business prospects could suffer 
we have experienced significant growth recently  both internally and through acquisitions 
we may not be able to successfully manage the increased scope of our operations or a significantly larger and more geographically diverse workforce as we expand 
any failure to successfully manage growth could harm our business and financial results 
additionally  growth increases the demands on our management  our internal systems  procedures and controls 
to successfully manage growth  we must add administrative staff and periodically update and strengthen our operating  financial and other systems  procedures and controls  which will increase our costs and may reduce our profitability 
we may be unable to successfully implement improvements to our information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls 
our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary intellectual property 
we rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets  patents  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property 
despite these precautions  unauthorized third parties may misappropriate  infringe upon  copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology 
we do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought  if at all  or whether any patents issued will be challenged or invalidated 
our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
we have been  and may be in the future  notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties 
if any such claims are asserted against us  we may seek to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
there is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms  precluding our use of the applicable technology 
alternatively  we may decide to litigate such claims or attempt to design around the patented technology 
these actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
as a result  any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims  whether or not proven to be true  may materially harm our business and prospects 
we have significant debt service requirements 
as of november   we had approximately million of total debt outstanding  including approximately million of original issue discount  substantially all of which was incurred in connection with the acquisition of isg 
subject to restrictions in our senior secured credit facility and our senior subordinated debentures  we may also incur significant amounts of additional debt for working capital  capital expenditures and other purposes 
our combined debt total could have important consequences for our company  including the following o we may have difficulty borrowing money for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes  o we will need to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay interest and the required principal payments on borrowings under our senior secured credit facility  which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations  capital expenditures and other activities  o our senior debt has a variable rate of interest  which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates  o borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are secured by all our assets  o we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business  o we may be less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions  including increased competition and demand for new products and services  and o we may not be able to implement our business plans 
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of  to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance  which to a certain extent is subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures 
if unable to generate such cash flow  we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as selling assets  restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital 
there can be no assurance that any of these strategies could be effected on satisfactory terms or without substantial additional expense to us 
significant acquisitions may be funded with additional indebtedness  which would increase debt service requirements 
these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
covenant restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated debentures may limit our ability to operate our business 
our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated debentures contain  among other things  covenants that may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs  to acquire additional businesses or to engage in other business activities 
currently the senior secured credit facility requires approval for acquisitions funded with aggregate cash consideration in excess of million 
in addition  our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated debentures sets forth covenants requiring us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated debentures  in which event our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable  which could materially adversely affect our business 
our stock price has been and could remain volatile 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors  including the following  some of which are beyond our control o variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors  o downward revisions in securities analysts estimates or changes in general market conditions  o irs or other governmental actions  including congressional hearings and investigations relating to section tax credits and media coverage relating thereto  o announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  o additions or departures of key personnel  o insider selling or buying  o regulatory developments affecting our industry  o general technological or economic trends  and o other matters discussed in risk factors 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of their stock  many companies have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
if we became involved in securities class action litigation in the future  it could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management s attention and resources and could harm our stock price  business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
future sales of our common stock could adversely affect our stock price 
substantial sales of our common stock in the public market  or the perception by the market that such sales could occur  could lower our stock price or make it difficult for us to raise additional equity capital in the future 
as of november   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
as of november   options and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of per share  of which options and warrants to purchase  shares had vested 
headwaters has in place a registration statement registering up to million in securities 
the securities registered under the registration statement may be offered to the public in the future by means of a prospectus supplement 
we cannot predict if future sales of our common stock  or the availability of our common stock for sale  will harm the market price for our common stock or our ability to raise capital by offering equity securities 
we have never paid dividends and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the future  so any short term return on your investment will depend on the market price of our capital stock 
we currently intend to retain any earnings to finance our operations and growth 
the terms and conditions of our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated debentures restrict and limit payments or distributions in respect of our capital stock 
delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover  which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 
we are a delaware corporation  and the anti takeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders 
in addition  our board of directors has the power  without stockholder approval  to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock  which could be used defensively if a takeover is threatened 
the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger  takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock  which  under certain circumstances  could reduce the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk headwaters is exposed to financial market risks  primarily related to changes in interest rates 
headwaters does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  and no significant derivative financial instruments were outstanding as of september  or subsequent thereto 
the majority of headwaters short term investments  all of which are classified as trading securities  consist of fixed rate us government securities or securities backed by the us government 
changes in interest rates can affect the market value of these investments  which are carried at market value in the consolidated balance sheets 
the periodic adjustments to reflect changes in market value are included in interest and net investment income in the consolidated statements of income 
based on the current amount of short term investments and expected near term changes in the amount of short term investments  headwaters does not expect any material near term investment losses to result from changes in interest rates 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  headwaters has outstanding million of variable rate long term debt as of september   which is repayable through august the interest rate on this debt as of september  was approximately 
in october  headwaters locked in a rate of for three months and in january  headwaters can lock in a new rate for one  three  or six months 
a change in the interest rate of would change interest expense by approximately million during the next months  considering required principal repayments
