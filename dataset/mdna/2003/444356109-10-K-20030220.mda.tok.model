in the normal course of business these risks are managed through a variety of strategies  including the use of a derivative financial instrument to hedge our underlying exposures 
the company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk interest rate risk arises primarily from variable rate borrowings in the united states and canada 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap  which is recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
the company has determined that the swap is effective  therefore  changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded on a quarterly basis as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the swap expires on april  at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of in earnings before income taxes 
during and for the first eight months of  the company did not borrow against its variable rate credit facility

a small portion of the company s sales  receivables  purchases and expenses are denominated in euros  australian dollars and the canadian dollar
