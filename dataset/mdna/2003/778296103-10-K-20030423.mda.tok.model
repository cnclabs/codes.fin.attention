new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas no 
supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue no 
and is effective for restructuring activities  if any  initiated after december  sfas no 
requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at its fair value 
accordingly  sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs  if any  as well as the amounts recognized  but will have no impact on exit liabilities recorded by the company prior to december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   while  the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
on january   the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of entities that are not controllable through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks and rewards 
these entities have been commonly referred to as special purpose entities 
the underlying principle behind fin is that if a business enterprise has the majority financial interest in an entity  defined in the guidance as a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities  and results of the activities of the variable interest entity should be included in consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise 
fin explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise should assess its interest in an entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
the company will apply the provisions of fin prospectively for all variable interest entities created after january  for variable interest entities created before january   the company will be required to consolidate all entities in which it was deemed to be the primary beneficiary beginning in the third quarter of as of february   the company was party to an agreement with a variable interest entity to finance and lease the perris  california distribution center as further described in note c of notes to consolidated financial statements 
under existing accounting guidance  neither the project assets nor related obligations are currently included in the company s balance sheets 
as the variable interest entity is currently structured  the company would be considered the primary beneficiary under fin and would be required to consolidate the entity beginning in the third quarter of fin requires that the company consolidate the assets  liabilities  and noncontrolling interests of the variable interest entities at their carrying amounts as if fin had been effective when the enterprise first met the conditions to be the primary beneficiary 
based upon the project costs incurred through february   consolidation of the variable interest entities would result in an additional million in property and related debt as of february  the company expects to spend a total of approximately million upon completion of the perris distribution center  which would result in an million increase in property and related debt and approximately million of annual depreciation if the company were to consolidate this variable interest entity 
the company may consider other financing structures for these projects in the future which may result in non consolidation under fin the company does not anticipate the changes in accounting requirements to impact planned levels of financing or its credit ratings 
the company was also a party to an million synthetic lease facility for its south carolina distribution center as further described in note c of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that consolidation of this synthetic lease will not be required under fin because the lessor owner of the distribution center is not a variable interest entity 
further guidance or clarification related to fin may be issued by the fasb  securities and exchange commission  or other authoritative bodies which could impact the accounting for this synthetic lease 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements inventory 
the company s merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost method 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if sales of the inventory are more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets 
the company records a long lived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows 
in the course of performing this analysis  management determined that no long lived asset impairment charge was required for years ended february   february  and february  should actual results differ materially from projected results  an impairment charge may be required in the future 
self insurance 
the company self insures certain of its workers compensation and general liability risks as well as certain of its health insurance plans 
the company s self insurance liability is determined actuarially  based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of the medical profession and state statutory requirements increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
forward looking statements and factors affecting future performance this report includes a number of forward looking statements  which reflect the company s current beliefs and estimates with respect to future events and the company s future financial performance  operations and competitive position 
the words expect  anticipate  estimate  believe  looking ahead  forecast  plan and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
the company s continued success depends  in part  upon its ability to increase sales at existing locations  to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s existing strategies and store expansion program will result in a continuation of revenue and profit growth 
future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability remain difficult to predict 
the forward looking statements that are contained in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from historical results or current expectations 
these factors include  without limitation  a general deterioration in economic trends  changes in geopolitical conditions  ongoing competitive pressures in the apparel industry  the company s ability to obtain acceptable store locations  the company s ability to continue to purchase attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts  the company s ability to successfully open its distribution center in southern california in a timely and cost effective manner  the company s ability to successfully extend its geographic reach into new markets  unseasonable weather trends  changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences in apparel or home related merchandise  the company s ability to attract and retain personnel with the retail talent necessary to execute its strategies  the company s ability to implement and integrate various new systems and technologies  and greater than planned costs 
in addition  the company s corporate headquarters  one of its distribution centers and of its stores are located in california 
therefore  a downturn in the california economy or a major natural disaster there could significantly affect the company s operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks  which primarily includes changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest that is payable on the company s credit facilities is based on variable interest rates and is  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
in addition  lease payments under the company s synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
lease payments on the southern california distribution center will begin upon completion of construction 
as of february   the company had million of long term debt outstanding which accrues interest at libor plus basis points 
the company does not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates to be material 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio
