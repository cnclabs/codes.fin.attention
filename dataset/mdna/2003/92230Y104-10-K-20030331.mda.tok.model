item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background our predecessor company  vasco corp  entered into the data security business in through the acquisition of a controlling interest in thumbscan  inc  which we renamed vasco data security  inc 
in in  we began an expansion of our computer security business by acquiring lintel security nv sa  a belgian corporation  which included assets associated with the development of security tokens and security technologies for personal computers and computer networks 
in addition  in  we acquired digipass nv sa  a belgian corporation  which was also a developer of security tokens and security technologies and whose name we changed to vasco data security nv sa in all of these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
on march   we completed a registered exchange offer with the holders of the outstanding securities of vasco corp 
in the exchange offer  holders of the common stock and warrants  options and other rights to acquire common stock of our predecessor company exchanged their securities for the same number and kind of securities of our present company  and released any potential claims that such holders might have had against our predecessor in connection with the issuances of its securities and other corporate actions which occurred mostly during the s 
in the exchange offer  almost of our predecessor s securities were tendered and accepted for exchange 
in october  we completed the merger of our predecessor with and into the current company and thereby eliminated all remaining outstanding securities of our predecessor and our predecessor thereby ceased to exist 
since the exchange offer  we have engaged in four acquisitions 
in may  we acquired the assets of secureware sa  a french company for a combination of our stock and cash totaling approximately million 
in october  we acquired intellisoft corp 
for a combination of stock and cash totaling approximately million with the cash being distributed to dissenting shareholders 
this acquisition was accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting and  therefore  all of our financial information has been restated to include the results of intellisoft 
in august  we acquired invincible data systems ids in a transaction that was accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
a total of  shares of the common stock were issued in the transaction 
our historical financial information was not restated for this transaction  which was deemed immaterial 
our latest acquisition was completed on march  when we acquired identikey ltd

under the terms of the purchase agreement  more than percent of the outstanding capital stock of identikey was exchanged for  shares of common stock 
this purchase was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  and accordingly  the acquired assets have been recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition

overview we design  develop  market and support security products and services that manage and protect against unauthorized access to computer systems of corporate and governmental clients 
revenue and earnings 
we sell the majority of our products in european countries with significant sales in the united states  and we intend to actively pursue additional markets  particularly south america  asia pacific  australia and the middle east 
revenues from sales from our digipass family continue to represent the majority of our total revenues 
digipass products accounted for of the company s revenues in and in excess of of the company s revenues in both and although we believe it is likely that sales of the digipass family of tokens  which can be used on various platforms  will continue to account for a majority of our total revenues for the next few years  we also believe that revenues from sales of our other hardware and software data security products  including the vacman product line  will increase in the future 
research and development 
we are devoting substantial capital and other resources to enhance our existing security products and develop new products to provide identity authentication security solutions on different platforms and for different applications 
costs of research and development  principally the design and development of hardware and software prior to the determination of technological feasibility  are expensed as incurred on a project by project basis 
our software capitalization policy currently defines technological feasibility as a functioning beta test prototype with confirmed manufacturability a working model  within a reasonably predictable range of costs 
additional criteria include receptive customers  or potential customers  as evidenced by interest expressed in a beta test prototype  at some suggested selling price 
variations in operating results 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
factors affecting operating results include the level of competition  size  timing  cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders  costs and availability of components  our success in expanding sales and marketing programs  technological changes in the market for data security products including the adoption of new technologies and standards  market acceptance of new products and product enhancements  new product announcements or introductions by our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and product enhancements  changes in pricing by us or our competitors  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and general economic trends and other factors 
in addition  for other than the corporate network access market  we have experienced  and may experience in the future  long sales cycles for customers with new applications 
we also experience seasonality in our business 
these seasonal trends are most notable in the summer months  particularly in europe  when many businesses defer purchase decisions 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed  a small variation in the timing of recognition of revenue could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
currency fluctuations 
approximately of our operating expenses in were denominated in a foreign currency 
in addition  while the majority of our supply and sales transactions are denominated in us dollars  a significant portion of those transactions are denominated in various foreign currencies 
in order to reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates  we attempt to match the timing of delivery  amount of product and the currency denomination of purchase orders placed with vendors with sales orders received from customers 
the financial position and results of operations of the company s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency 
accordingly  assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year 
translation adjustments arising from differences in exchange rates are included as a separate component of stockholders equity deficit 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
foreign exchange transaction gains aggregating   and  are included in other non operating income for   and  respectively

recent developments on march   the company announced that it had entered into a letter of intent to sell its vacman enterprise business  originally known as snareworks  to secured services  inc the company will continue to sell  support  maintain  and develop its vacman and digipass strong user authentication products 
the letter of intent provides that the company will receive million of a class of convertible preferred stock from secured services and a share of the net profits of the business earned from existing customers over the three years subsequent to the sale date 
the preferred stock will accrue a cumulative dividend payable at maturity in months or upon earlier redemption  and will be convertible at maturity based upon a formula conversion price 
closing of the transaction is contingent upon the satisfactory completion of due diligence and the execution of a definitive agreement  and is expected to occur in the second quarter of liquidity and capital resources at december   our aggregate consolidated indebtedness was  cash used in operating activities was  during the year ended december  during  we used  in investing activities   in financing activities consisting of debt payments  and the effect of unfavorable changes in exchange rates resulted in the use of  net capital expenditures  assets purchased less assets sold  used  for the year ended december  in  we entered into a convertible loan agreement with artesia bank nv  formerly banque paribas belgique nv and now doing business as dexia bank dexia  in order to refinance the  payment due december  in connection with our acquisition of digipass 
the terms of the agreement provided that the  principal amount is convertible  upon an offering  into shares of our common stock 
the original interest was at the rate of  payable annually  and the original maturity date was on september  on august   the terms of this loan were restructured 
under the revised terms  the loan is now convertible into shares of our common stock at the fixed conversion rate of per share rather than a floating rate based on the market price of our common stock 
the maturity date of the convertible loan is september  and the interest rate is 
the loan is secured by a pledge of our common stock owned by mr 
t 
kendall hunt  the company s chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer 
in consideration of that pledge  the company has entered into an agreement with mr 
hunt wherein  in the event that his shares are surrendered to dexia under the pledge agreement  the company will indemnify mr 
hunt for the fair value of the shares surrendered and pay such amount over a period that is mutually acceptable to the parties 
in july  the company issued  shares of preferred stock for cash of  the preferred stock is convertible into  shares of common stock at any time through july if not converted by july  the preferred stock will  at the option of the company  be either repurchased or converted into common stock at a rate equal to the average market price of the common stock for consecutive business days on which the common stock was traded prior to the conversion date less five percent 
the company maintains an overdraft agreement with fortis banque bank of belgium 
under terms of the agreement  the company can borrow an amount equal to of its belgium subsidiary s defined accounts receivable up to maximum of two million euros 
borrowings under the overdraft agreement accrue interest at an annual rate of and the company is obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 
as of december   approximately  euros was available under the overdraft agreement and there were no borrowings outstanding under the agreement 
the agreement is secured by the assets of the belgian subsidiary and while it has no specific termination date  it can be terminated with thirty days notice 
the agreement is governed by the general lending conditions for corporate customers  registered in brussels belgium on december  the net effect of activity resulted in a decrease in cash of  and a cash balance of  at december   compared to  at the end of our working capital at december  was a deficit of  a decrease of  from  at december  the change is attributable to the classification of the  term loan as a current liability and to operating activities 
our current ratio was to at december  we believe that our current cash balances  credit available under our existing overdraft agreement  the anticipated cash generated from operations  including the realization of deferred revenue recorded as a current liability  deposits received on orders of digipass to be delivered in and the impact of either renegotiating the loan with dexia  or entering into a separate agreement to replace or repay the loan to dexia  or having mr 
hunt surrender his shares to dexia will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future 
there is substantial risk  however  that the our revenue and cash receipts will not grow at a sufficient rate to generate the funds needed to repay our debt to dexia within the terms of the existing agreement 
if we are unable to meet our revenue and cash goals and are also unable to renegotiate the terms of the agreement with dexia or reach a mutually acceptable agreement with mr 
hunt as an indemnity for his loss as a result of his surrender of shares of our common stock to dexia  we will need to significantly reduce our workforce  sell certain of our assets  enter into strategic relationships or business combinations  discontinue some or all of our operations  or take other similar restructuring actions 
while we expect that these actions would result in a reduction of recurring costs  they also may result in a reduction of recurring revenues and cash receipts 
it is also likely that we would incur substantial non recurring costs to implement one or more of these restructuring actions 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for services 
we analyze accounts receivable  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  and software development costs we assess the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company assesses the recoverability of its purchased software against estimated future revenue for the individual products over the estimated remaining economic life of the software 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
given the highly competitive environment and technological changes in our industry  it is reasonably possible that estimates of anticipated future revenue  the remaining economic life of the company s software products  or both may be reduced significantly

a significant portion of our business operations is transacted in foreign currencies 
as a result  we have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations 
we are affected by both foreign currency translation and transaction adjustments 
translation adjustments result from the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries balance sheets and income statements to us dollars at year end exchange rates and weighted average exchange rates  respectively 
translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded directly into stockholders equity 
transaction adjustments result from currency exchange movements when a foreign subsidiary transacts business in a currency that differs from its local currency 
these transactions are recorded as gains or losses in our statement of operations 
our foreign subsidiaries business transactions are spread across approximately different countries and currencies 
this geographic diversity reduces the risk to our operating results 
interest rate risk we have minimal interest rate risk 
our  long term debt has a fixed rate of  which is not subject to market fluctuations 
this note matures in september if renegotiated  the interest rate on the debt could increase 
interest expense will increase  annually for each percentage point that the interest rate increases 
impairment risk at december   we had goodwill and other intangible assets of  related mostly to technology purchased in as part of our acquisition of identikey

while we did not experience impairment for the year ended december   we may incur impairment charges in future periods
