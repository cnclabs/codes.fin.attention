long term investments increased million to million at march  compared to million at march  investments consist principally of municipal securities and corporate bonds and are classified as available for sale as of march  and available for sale investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from operations and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity  except for other than temporary impairments  which are reported as a charge to current operations and result in a new cost basis for the investment 
the company classifies investments that mature within one year as short term

as of march   mesaba s fleet consisted of aircraft covered under operating leases with remaining terms of less than a month to years and aggregate monthly lease payments of approximately million 
mesaba has the ability to return to the lessor up to turbo prop aircraft which  if all were returned  would reduce mesaba s aggregate monthly lease payment by a total of million 
mesaba leases all of its saab aircraft  either directly from aircraft leasing companies or through subleases with northwest under operating leases with original terms of up to years 
mesaba leases its rj aircraft from northwest under operating leases with terms of up to years 
continued funding of the monthly minimum lease payments is ensured as long as the current operating contracts with northwest are in effect 
as of march   big sky s fleet consisted of aircraft covered under operating leases with remaining terms of six months to months and aggregate monthly lease payments of approximately million 
big sky s leases of its aircraft from leasing companies and an aircraft from a municipality under operating leases with initial terms of up to six years 
two of the leases allow big sky to return the aircraft to the lessor upon the occurrence of certain events  and five of the leases contain purchase options 
funding of the monthly minimum lease payments is dependent on continued passenger boardings and ultimately the operations of the company 
approximately of the company s accounts receivable balance as of march  was due from northwest 
loss of mesaba s affiliation with northwest or northwest s failure to make timely payment of amounts owed to mesaba or to otherwise materially perform under the airlink or jet agreement for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and financial results 
the following table summarizes the company s commitments to make long term debt and lease payments for the years ending march thereafter total operating leases aircraft      non aircraft       long term debt  capital lease total       amounts represent minimum lease payments with initial or remaining terms of more than one year

outlook the economic outlook for the company is dependent on business and consumer behavior which continues to be affected by lingering threats of terrorist activity post september   continued economic weakness  increased political unrest in the middle east and ongoing health alerts such as sars 
these factors are likely to persist throughout fiscal management believes the company is in a sound financial position at the beginning of fiscal with a combined cash  cash equivalent and investments balance of approximately million 
mesaba and big sky expect to continue to concentrate on excellent operating performance including four key measures completion factor  on time arrival  safety  and operating costs 
careful resource management including aggressive cost control measures with significance placed on finalization of a viable labor contract with both mesaba s pilots and mechanics will contribute positively to the company s financial performance 
cost control measures will continue to be closely monitored through various cost metrics 
in fiscal  the company will also focus on exploring additional growth opportunities with its existing subsidiaries 
these include expansion of big sky s business and opportunities to expand mesaba s flight schedule with mesaba s business partner  northwest 
management believes that the company s internal capital base is a strong foundation to invest in such growth 
management currently believes that the company s cash  cash equivalents  and investments  as well as cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses  debt service requirements and capital expenditures through fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes

the company also has other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these items 
management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  based on information presently available  however  changes in these estimates  judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of future events  and accordingly actual results could differ from amounts estimated 
aircraft property and equipment estimated lives are used to record depreciation on aircraft property and equipment 
aircraft utilization  technology  and changes in the business strategy may affect the economic lives used to record depreciation by mesaba or big sky 
the foregoing may also impact depreciation rates  impairment  or both 
management of mesaba and big sky regularly review the estimated useful lives and salvage values for aircraft property and equipment 
excess and obsolete inventories estimated recovery percentages are used to record obsolescence reserves for parts inventories 
aircraft utilization  parts availability  and changes in parts cost may affect the valuation of parts inventories and obsolescence reserve levels 
management of mesaba and big sky regularly review recovery percentages  reserve levels and inventory valuations for parts inventories 
aircraft maintenance estimated maintenance costs and anticipated aircraft activity are used to determine maintenance reserves 
changes in maintenance contracts  parts and labor costs and aircraft activity may affect the maintenance reserves 
management of mesaba and big sky regularly review airplane activity  expected aircraft return dates  changes in its maintenance contracts and parts and labor costs for maintenance reserves
