item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations wps resources corporation wps resources corporation is a holding company 
our wholly owned subsidiaries include two regulated utilities  wisconsin public service corporation and upper peninsula power company 
another wholly owned subsidiary  wps resources capital corporation  is a holding company for our nonregulated businesses including wps energy services  inc and wps power development  inc compared with wps resources corporation overview wps resources and results of operations are shown in the following table wps resources results millions  except share amounts change consolidated operating revenues income available for common shareholders basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share the increase in earnings per share was largely driven by a gain at wps power development related to the sale of part of its synthetic fuel operations 
the sale occurred in the fourth quarter of  and we deferred recognition of a portion of the related gain on the sale pending the satisfaction of certain contingencies 
in addition  wps energy services net income increased  primarily due to improved natural gas margins 
a full year contribution from gas utility operations acquired in the spring of  warmer than normal weather during the heating season in  and a rate increase approved by regulators resulted in increased earnings from our gas utility in even with the rate increases approved by regulators  we were unable to earn the full return approved by them 
overview of utility operations utility operations include the electric utility operations at wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power and the natural gas utility operations at wisconsin public service 
income available for common shareholders attributable to electric utility operations was million in compared with million in income available for common shareholders attributable to gas utility operations was million in and million in utility margins at wisconsin public service were impacted positively by a public service commission of wisconsin interim rate order  which was effective january   authorizing a increase in wisconsin retail electric rates and a increase in wisconsin retail natural gas rates 
in late june  wisconsin public service received a final rate order which authorized a increase in wisconsin retail electric rates and a increase in wisconsin retail natural gas rates 
the final order authorized a lower retail natural gas rate increase than was approved in the interim order resulting in a million refund to wisconsin public service s natural gas customers 
electric utility margins the consolidated electric utility margin represents electric revenue less cost of sales exclusive of intercompany transactions 
our consolidated electric utility margin increased million  or  due to the wisconsin retail electric rate increases at wisconsin public service and higher overall electric utility sales volumes 
wps resources consolidated electric utility results millions revenues fuel and purchased power costs margins sales in kilowatt hours our consolidated electric utility revenues increased million  or  in as the result of the electric rate increases and an increase in overall electric sales volumes at wisconsin public service 
sales volumes were up for lower margin  wholesale customers while sales to higher margin  residential customers increased and sales to higher margin  commercial and industrial customers increased 
summer weather was warmer in than in  and warmer than normal 
increased fuel costs for power generation were partially offset by lower purchased power expenses 
our consolidated fuel expense for generation plants increased million  or  in our consolidated purchased power expense  however  decreased million  or  in overall generation from wisconsin public service s plants increased while purchased volumes decreased 
the change in the energy supply mix was largely due to the availability of less expensive power generation from the kewaunee nuclear power plant 
wisconsin public service increased its ownership interest in the kewaunee plant to in september although upper peninsula power s purchased volumes remained fairly consistent  the unit cost of its purchased power decreased 
the public service commission of wisconsin allows wisconsin public service to adjust prospectively the amount billed to wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range 
wisconsin public service is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus from forecasted costs on an annualized basis 
wisconsin public service did not submit any fuel filings in gas utility margins the consolidated gas utility margin represents natural gas revenues less purchases exclusive of intercompany transactions 
effective april   the gas utility margin at wisconsin public service includes the merged wisconsin fuel and light company operations 
wisconsin public service corporation s gas utility results millions revenues purchase costs margins throughput in therms an increase in overall natural gas throughput volumes of and the wisconsin retail gas rate increase resulted in a higher gas utility margin of million  or  in increased overall gas throughput volumes were partially the result of including months of operations for former wisconsin fuel and light in compared with the inclusion of months of operations in gas throughput volumes were also affected by a heating season that was colder in than in  but milder than normal 
wisconsin public service s gas revenues decreased million  or  in and gas purchase costs decreased million  or  largely as the result of a decrease in the average unit cost of natural gas in wisconsin public service passes changes in the cost of gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause  as allowed by the public service commission of wisconsin and the michigan public service commission under current regulatory practice 
other utility expenses income utility operating and maintenance expense increased million in largely due to amortization of regulatory deferrals  increased benefit costs  higher transmission expenses associated with american transmission company  increased expenses at the kewaunee plant as a result of wisconsin public service acquiring additional ownership interest in the plant  and increased energy conservation expenses 
utility depreciation and decommissioning expense increased million in largely due to additional plant assets at wisconsin public service  including its increased ownership interest in the kewaunee plant 
lower depreciation expense of million related to decreased decommissioning earnings partially offset the increased plant asset depreciation 
utility miscellaneous income decreased million in primarily as the result of lower earnings of million on wisconsin public service s nuclear decommissioning trust assets 
due to regulatory practice  a decrease in earnings on the trust assets is largely offset by decreased depreciation expense 
overview of nonregulated operations nonregulated operations consist of the natural gas  electric  and other sales at wps energy services  a diversified energy supply and services company  and the operations of wps power development  an electric generation asset development company 
wps energy services net income increased to million in compared with million in primarily due to a higher gas margin 
wps power development s net income increased to million in compared with million in largely due to recognition of a gain related to the sale of a portion of its synthetic fuel operations 
overview of wps energy services wps energy services principal businesses involve nonregulated gas and electric sales 
revenues at wps energy services were billion in compared with billion in  a decrease of 
the decrease was the result of a lower unit cost of natural gas in partially offset by additional natural gas and electric sales volumes 
the lower unit cost of natural gas is also reflected in cost of sales  thus having no impact on margin 
net income increased million  or  in due to increased gas margins and improved operations 
wps energy services margins wps energy services gas results millions except sales volumes nonregulated natural gas revenues nonregulated natural gas cost of sales margins wholesale sales volumes in billion cubic feet retail sales volumes in billion cubic feet nonregulated gas revenues at wps energy services decreased million  or  in primarily as the result of lower natural gas prices in the nonregulated gas margin increased million  or  in due to improved management of the retail gas procurement and volume risk processes and increased retail sales volumes 
wps energy services electric results millions nonregulated electric revenues nonregulated electric cost of sales margins wholesale sales in kilowatt hours retail sales in kilowatt hours nonregulated electric revenues at wps energy services increased million  or  in due to higher sales volumes 
the nonregulated electric margin decreased million  or  in primarily due to the slow economy which produced less favorable market conditions for opportunity sales in wps energy services other expenses operating expenses at wps energy services increased million in largely due to costs associated with business expansion and increased bad debt expense 
overview of wps power development revenues at wps power development were million in compared with million in  an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to the operation of the generation assets obtained from ch resources in the second quarter of and the operation of the combined locks energy center 
partially offsetting these increases were a change in accounting from consolidation to equity method accounting for wps power development s synthetic fuel operations and lower revenues from steam sales 
wps power development s margin wps power development s production results millions nonregulated other revenues nonregulated other cost of sales margins wps power development experienced an increase of million  or  in its margin in the margin increased million at the sunbury generation plant in due to lower fuel costs and lower prices for spot market purchases which allowed sunbury to meet its firm contracts at a lower cost 
the operation of the generation assets obtained in the june ch resources acquisition and the startup of the combined locks energy center contributed to wps power development s higher margin in a change in accounting for wps power development s synthetic fuel operations also increased margins 
as a result of the sale of a portion of wps power development s synthetic fuel operations  wps power development no longer consolidates these operations as a part of revenue and cost of sales 
the remaining interest in the synthetic fuel operations is now accounted for under the equity method of accounting with such amounts recorded as a component of miscellaneous income 
wps power development s other expenses income tax credits operating expenses at wps power development increased million in primarily due to maintenance and other expenses at the sunbury generation plant  including costs related to a staff reduction that was announced november  and took effect in january costs associated with the generation assets obtained in the ch resources acquisition and operation of the combined locks energy center also contributed to increased operating expenses in depreciation expense increased million in due to additional plant assets at wps power development  including the combined locks energy center and the assets obtained in the ch resources acquisition 
a nitrogen oxide reduction project at sunbury also contributed to increased depreciation expense in wps power development s miscellaneous income increased million in primarily as the result of recognizing a pretax gain of million approximately million after tax related to the sale of part of wps power development s synthetic fuel operations 
wps power development recognized a pretax gain of million approximately million after tax on the sale in the fourth quarter of and deferred the remaining portion of the gain pending satisfaction of certain contingencies  including the receipt of a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service 
the contingencies were satisfied in and the remaining gain was recognized 
wps power development also recognized royalties of million in related to its synthetic fuel operations 
partially offsetting these factors were equity method losses for wps power development s synthetic fuel operations 
wps power development recorded synthetic fuel tax credits of million in  an increase of approximately million over overview of holding company and other operations holding company and other operations include the operations of wps resources and wps resources capital as holding companies and the nonutility activities at wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power 
holding company and other operations experienced a net loss of million in compared with net income of million in a net loss was experienced in primarily due to interest expense from financing to provide funds for subsidiary operations 
our asset management strategy resulted in pretax gains of million in compared with pretax gains of approximately million in wps resources asset management strategy  which was initiated in  is a five to seven year plan intended to optimize shareholder return from the sale  development  or use of certain assets 
in addition  earnings on equity investments were higher in compared with primarily due to our investment in american transmission company 
tax credits we used tax credits to the extent the tax law permits to reduce our current federal income tax liability  and the remaining credits increased our alternative minimum tax credit available for future years 
approximately million of alternative minimum tax credits were carried over from  which brings the cumulative credits being carried forward to approximately million 
alternative minimum tax credits can be used in future years to reduce our regular tax liability  subject to various limitations 
based on a review of all known facts and circumstances  management has concluded that it is more likely than not that we will be able to use these credits in the future to reduce our federal income tax liability 
weighted average shares the weighted average number of outstanding shares of wps resources common stock increased million shares during the increase was largely due to issuing million additional shares through a public offering in the fourth quarter of and issuing million shares in the merger of wisconsin fuel and light into wisconsin public service in the second quarter of additional shares were also issued in under the stock investment plan 
compared with wps resources corporation overview wps resources and results of operations are shown in the following table wps resources results millions  except share amounts change consolidated operating revenues income available for common shareholders basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share consolidated operating revenues increased in due to sales volume growth for all business segments and higher natural gas prices in the first part of in addition  rate increases at wisconsin public service contributed to increased revenues in the public service commission of wisconsin authorized a increase in wisconsin retail electric rates and a increase in wisconsin retail natural gas rates effective january  increased profitability at our nonregulated segments offset a decrease in earnings at our electric and natural gas utility segments 
higher earnings resulted from a gain on the sale of hydro lands as part of our asset management strategy  increased natural gas and electric utility margins  increased electric and natural gas margins at wps energy services  additional tax credits at wps power development and a gain on the sale of a portion of wps power development s investment in its synthetic fuel operations 
partially offsetting these factors were increased operating expenses at all segments and a lower margin at wps power development 
overview of utility operations income available for common shareholders attributable to electric utility operations was million in compared with million in income available for common shareholders attributable to gas utility operations was million in and million in electric utility margins our consolidated electric utility margin increased million  or  in primarily due to a wisconsin retail electric rate increase at wisconsin public service  which became effective on january   and higher sales volumes to most customer classes at upper peninsula power and wisconsin public service 
summer weather was warmer in than in  and warmer than normal 
partially offsetting these factors was a decrease in sales to large commercial and industrial customers at wisconsin public service due to declining economic conditions 
affecting the electric utility margin was a change in the customer mix at wisconsin public service in sales to lower margin  non firm customers increased more than sales to higher margin customers 
the lack of new retail electric rates at upper peninsula power also affected the margin negatively 
our consolidated fuel expense for production plants decreased million  or  in largely due to decreased production at wisconsin public service s combustion turbine generation plants 
our consolidated purchased power expense  however  increased million due to an increase in power purchases and a increase in the cost per kilowatt hour of power purchases made by wisconsin public service in compared with power purchases were higher in due to warmer summer weather and the availability of economically priced energy 
also contributing to increased power purchases were a scheduled outage at wisconsin public service s nuclear plant and an unscheduled outage at one of its fossil fueled generation plants 
wisconsin public service s kewaunee plant was off line for a scheduled refueling and replacement of its steam generators which began in late september the kewaunee plant returned to service in early december as scheduled 
wisconsin public service is a owner of the kewaunee plant 
wisconsin public service s pulliam unit was off line for unscheduled repairs in the fourth quarter of and returned to service in february wisconsin public service chose to take advantage of purchased power during these outages because of economically favorable pricing 
the public service commission of wisconsin allows wisconsin public service to adjust prospectively the amount billed to wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range 
in the third quarter of  wisconsin public service submitted a fuel filing with the public service commission of wisconsin requesting a million retail electric rate reduction 
the rate reduction was approved and implemented on september  wisconsin public service submitted an additional fuel filing in november  and a rate reduction of million was approved and implemented on december  gas utility margins effective april   the gas utility margin at wisconsin public service includes the merged wisconsin fuel and light company operations 
the gas utility margin at wisconsin public service increased million  or  in this increase was due to a increase in wisconsin retail natural gas rates effective january   and a increase in overall natural gas throughput volumes 
increased gas throughput volumes were largely the result of wisconsin public service s acquisition of wisconsin fuel and light in the second quarter of gas throughput volumes to large commercial and industrial customers  however  decreased as a result of customers switching to the gas transport customer class and declining economic conditions 
gas throughput volumes to gas transport customers increased 
in addition  gas throughput volumes to interruptible customers decreased 
gas throughput volumes were negatively affected by winter weather  which was milder in than in and milder than normal 
wisconsin public service s natural gas revenues increased million  or  as the result of an increase in the average unit cost of natural gas in the first half of  increased throughput as a result of wisconsin public service s acquisition of wisconsin fuel and light in the second quarter of  and the increase in wisconsin retail gas rates 
wisconsin public service s natural gas purchase costs increased million  or  in largely due to a higher average unit cost of natural gas in the first half of the higher natural gas prices experienced earlier in were passed on to customers and are reflected in both revenues and gas purchases  thus having little impact on margin 
other utility expenses income utility operating expenses increased million in largely due to increased transmission expenses associated with the transfer of assets to american transmission company  increased payments to the wisconsin department of administration for energy conservation activities  increased maintenance costs at the kewaunee plant during its refueling outage  and higher write offs of uncollectible accounts 
the public service commission of wisconsin allowed a portion of the higher transmission costs to be deferred 
the deferred transmission costs  million for  were recovered in wisconsin retail rates 
lower earnings on the nuclear decommissioning fund contributed to a decrease in other income from utility operations in due to regulatory practice  lower earnings on the nuclear decommissioning fund were largely offset by decreased depreciation expense 
an extension in the kewaunee plant s assumed depreciable life and a reduction in the nuclear decommissioning fund contribution also contributed to decreased depreciation expense 
interest expense increased due to the issuance of additional long term debt by wisconsin public service in august overview of nonregulated operations wps energy services net income increased to million in compared with million in wps power development s net income increased to million in compared with million in overview of wps energy services revenues at wps energy services grew to billion in compared with million in  an increase of 
this increase was the result of additional natural gas and electric sales volumes coupled with a higher unit cost of natural gas in the first half of the higher unit cost of natural gas is also reflected in cost of sales  thus having no impact on margin 
income increased million in due to increased sales and improved operations 
wps energy services margins nonregulated gas revenues at wps energy services increased million  or  primarily as the result of sales volume growth and higher natural gas prices in the first half of the nonregulated gas margin increased million  or  in due to increased sales volumes and exiting from unprofitable market segments 
nonregulated electric revenues at wps energy services increased million  or  in the nonregulated electric margin increased million  or  in higher electric sales volumes in existing and newly entered retail electric markets  increased electric wholesale activities  as well as impacts from marketing energy from wps power development s sunbury plant  contributed to these increases 
wps energy services other expenses operating expenses at wps energy services increased million in largely due to costs associated with business expansion and higher bad debt expense 
overview of wps power development revenues at wps power development increased million  or  in primarily due to higher revenues from its steam operations of million and higher revenues at its sunbury generation plant of million 
wps power development s income was million in compared with million in additional tax credits of approximately million from its synthetic fuel operation was the primary factor in wps power development s increased income in wps power development s margin wps power development experienced a decrease of million in its margin in the primary factors in this decrease were a million margin decrease at sunbury due to higher fuel costs as a result of purchasing coal at current market prices  and higher costs of replacement power during outages 
wps power development recovered a portion of the fuel cost increase through settlement with its coal supplier 
the sunbury margin decrease was partially offset by higher margins at the westwood generation plant  which was acquired in september wps power development s other expenses income tax credits operating expenses at wps power development increased million in primarily due to costs associated with operations at the westwood plant  higher payroll expenses  and increased development costs for potential new projects 
miscellaneous income increased million in primarily due to recognizing a pretax gain of million approximately million after tax related to the sale of a portion of wps power development s synthetic fuel operations 
wps power development recorded synthetic fuel tax credits of million in  an increase of approximately million over overview of holding company and other operations holding company and other operations experienced net income of million in compared with a net loss of million in miscellaneous nonutility income included pretax gains of approximately million including a pretax gain of million on the sale of hydro lands at wisconsin public service in december the sale of these hydro lands was a significant transaction in a five to seven year asset management strategy to optimize shareholder return from the sale  development  or use of certain assets 
in addition  earnings on equity investments were higher in compared with primarily due to our investment in american transmission company 
interest expense increased due to additional short term borrowing at wps resources for working capital needs in the first half of tax credits we used tax credits to the extent the tax law permits to reduce our current federal income tax liability  and the remainder increased our alternative minimum tax credit available for future years 
approximately million of alternative minimum tax credits where carried over from  which brought the cumulative credits being carried forward to approximately million at the end of balance sheet wps resources compared with customer and other receivables increased million in and accrued unbilled revenues increased million in  both as the result of increased sales volumes at wisconsin public service and wps energy services due to colder weather and customer growth 
wisconsin retail rate increases at wisconsin public service also contributed to these higher balances 
current assets from risk management activities increased million in and current liabilities from risk management activities increased million 
long term assets from risk management activities decreased million in and long term liabilities from risk management activities decreased million 
these variances were largely due to changes in forward prices and increased volumes 
property  plant  and equipment increased million due to additional plant assets at wisconsin public service  including construction of portions of the pulliam combustion turbine and the wausau to duluth transmission line  and additional plant assets at wps power development  including the assets obtained in the ch resources acquisition and capital expenditures at the sunbury generation plant 
accounts payable increased million in largely due to the million payable as the result of wisconsin public service s purchase of the de pere energy center in december increased natural gas purchases at wisconsin public service and wps energy services as the result of colder weather and customer growth also contributed to the higher accounts payable balance 
long term debt increased million in due to the issuance in the fourth quarter of of senior unsecured notes at wps resources and senior notes  which were secured by first mortgage bonds  at wisconsin public service 
extinguishment of the capital lease obligation related to the de pere energy center and the retirement of first mortgage bonds at wisconsin public service partially offset these factors 
liquidity and capital resources wps resources financing wps resources normally uses internally generated funds and commercial paper borrowing to satisfy most of its capital requirements 
we may periodically issue long term debt and common stock to reduce short term debt  maintain desired capitalization ratios  and fund future growth 
we may seek nonrecourse financing for funding some nonregulated acquisitions 
wps resources commercial paper borrowing program provides for working capital requirements of the nonregulated businesses and upper peninsula power 
wisconsin public service has its own commercial paper borrowing program 
the specific forms of long term financing  amounts  and timing depend on the availability of projects  market conditions  and other factors 
wps resources and wisconsin public service completed the syndication of revolving credit lines of million and million  respectively  during the third quarter of the current credit ratings for wps resources and wisconsin public service are listed in the table below 
credit ratings standard poor s moody s wps resources corporation senior unsecured debt commercial paper trust preferred securities credit line syndication a a bbb aa p a aa wisconsin public service corporation bonds preferred stock commercial paper credit line syndication aa a a aa a p aa the above ratings reflect a standard poor s downgrade of wps resources senior unsecured debt rating from a to a and the trust preferred securities rating from a to bbb 
at the same time  standard poor s affirmed wps resources commercial paper rating of a and affirmed all of wisconsin public service s previous ratings 
we believe these ratings continue to be among the best in the energy industry  and they have allowed us to access commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable terms 
credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  are subject to change  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
in  we issued new shares of common stock under our stock investment plan and under certain stock based employee benefit plans 
equity increased million in as a result of these plans 
wps resources also repurchased million of existing common stock for stock based compensation plans in wps resources issued million of year senior unsecured notes in november we used approximately million of the net proceeds from the issuance of these notes to repay short term debt incurred to provide equity capital to our subsidiaries and the remainder for other corporate purposes 
wisconsin public service issued million of year senior notes in december under a shelf registration for the offering and sale of up to million in long term debt 
the senior notes are secured by a pledge of first mortgage bonds and may become unsecured if wisconsin public service retires all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds 
wisconsin public service used approximately million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to acquire the de pere energy center and million to retire short term debt 
the balance of the net proceeds was used for other corporate purposes 
wisconsin public service retired million of first mortgage bonds in october an additional million of first mortgage bonds were retired on february  wps resources may issue additional debt and or common stock in the size of the debt and common stock issues is contingent on the level of future investment activity by our subsidiaries 
wisconsin public service expects to issue additional debt in regulatory on march   wisconsin public service filed an application with the public service commission of wisconsin to modify its wisconsin retail electric and natural gas rates for and in order to ensure reliable energy into the future and to recover increased costs  wisconsin public service requested retail electric rate increases of in and in and retail natural gas rate increases of in and in wisconsin public service requested a return on equity  with equity constituting of the capital structure 
on february   the public service commission of wisconsin ruled on the requested rate increase  including a return on equity with no change in the capital structure 
a final order is anticipated by mid march on december   the michigan public service commission approved an increase in retail electric rates for customers of upper peninsula power 
the commission granted an return on equity 
on february   wisconsin public service filed an application with the michigan public service commission for new electric rates for its michigan retail customers 
wisconsin public service requested a increase in michigan electric rates  its first request since since it is uncertain as to when the michigan public service commission will review its request  wisconsin public service also filed for a interim rate increase 
if approved  the interim rates will be in effect until final rates are approved 
wisconsin public service intends to file for an increase in wholesale electric rates with the federal energy regulatory commission in the first quarter of if the filing meets all the necessary criteria  new rates could be implemented  subject to refund  as early as sixty one days after the initial filing 
if the rate case is litigated to a conclusion  the process could take up to three years to complete 
asset sales  acquisitions  and construction on september   wisconsin public service received a certificate of authority from the public service commission of wisconsin to construct an megawatt combustion turbine unit at its pulliam plant location 
construction of the unit  which is expected to cost approximately million  should be complete in june on december   wisconsin public service purchased the megawatt de pere energy center and terminated the related existing purchased power agreement 
wisconsin public service paid million at the close of the transaction  with the remaining million due in december as a result of this transaction  wisconsin public service extinguished its capital lease obligation and entered into a purchased power agreement for up to megawatts from a plant yet to be constructed 
the new purchased power agreement is contingent on timely plant construction 
wisconsin public service expects to recover a substantial portion of the remaining payment in future customer rates 
as part of its regulated utility operations  wisconsin public service expects to submit an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to the public service commission of wisconsin in late for approval to build a megawatt coal fired generation facility near wausau  wisconsin 
wisconsin public service anticipates receiving approval from the public service commission of wisconsin in the facility is estimated to cost approximately million  assuming the public service commission of wisconsin allows a current return on construction costs 
the facility will be funded with internally generated funds  debt issues  and equity 
wps resources may need to issue additional common stock to fund equity to wisconsin public service 
effective june   wps power development acquired ch resources  inc from central hudson energy services  inc 
for million 
on november   wps energy services acquired an existing book of retail gas business in canada 
consideration for the purchase consists of an earn out to the seller based on a percent of margin on the volume delivered during the two years ending october  the retail volumes of this book of business have the potential to equal wps energy services current retail gas volumes 
wps energy services was appointed manager of quest energy  llc in november the appointment as manager  as well as other factors including the provision of substantial financial support  resulted in the consolidation of quest s financial statements with those of wps resources at december  wps resources assigned the right to convert its interest bearing note and other indebtedness from quest to equity to wps energy services in january and on january   the conversion was exercised at which time quest became a wholly owned subsidiary of wps energy services 
in december wisconsin public service sold approximately  acres of land on the peshtigo river in northeastern wisconsin to the wisconsin department of natural resources for million 
this sale was a significant transaction in wps resources five to seven year asset management strategy which was initiated in the agreement with the department of natural resources includes two options  one exercisable in and the other in  whereby the department may acquire  at less than fair value  approximately  additional acres for million if both options are exercised 
the value associated with the difference between the option price and the fair value will be treated as a charitable contribution 
as part of our asset management strategy  we sold additional assets in for gains of million 
on december   wps power development sold a interest in eco coal pelletization  llc  the company wps power development owns which holds our interest in the synthetic fuel project 
wps power development received consideration of million cash  as well as a fixed note and a variable note 
payments under the variable note are contingent upon the synthetic fuel production facility achieving specified levels of synthetic fuel production 
in conjunction with the sale  wps power development has agreed to make certain payments to a third party broker  consisting of an up front payment of million which was paid at the time of closing  and projected payments in and of approximately million per year 
at december   a deferred gain of million was reflected on wps power development s balance sheet 
this deferred gain represents the present value of future payments under the fixed note and the up front cash payments net of transaction costs 
it does not include an amount for the variable note which is contingent upon the synthetic fuel production allocation 
wps power development anticipates recognizing cumulative pretax income of approximately million over the period from to as a result of this transaction  assuming all contingencies are satisfied 
sunbury generation plant as a result of market conditions  the sunbury generation plant has not met our projected near term financial performance levels 
wps power development expects to contribute up to million of additional capital to sunbury generation  llc for operational needs in this amount is in addition to the million that wps resources and wps power development infused into sunbury generation in  primarily for the project to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from the plant 
the nitrogen oxide reduction project was anticipated when the plant was acquired 
we initially projected that sunbury generation would generate sufficient cash flow in for operations  with the exception of capital expenditures  but market conditions in which sunbury generation participates have degraded for capacity 
although sunbury s operating performance is now nearing industry standards for equivalent availability  market conditions continue to be depressed 
if present market conditions persist  additional capital may be needed in for operational needs 
in an effort to mitigate the impact of these market conditions  we have initiated several cost control measures at sunbury generation  including a reduction in the work force at sunbury effective january see discussion of critical accounting policies for additional information 
combined locks energy center wps power development temporarily removed the combined locks energy center from operation in august due to emission compliance testing results 
wps power development successfully retested the unit in december the unit was returned to service in december fines or penalties associated with this event  if any  are not expected to be material 
wps energy services aggregation program wps energy services has a delinquent receivables balance of million as a result of rules related to the former hierarchy of application for customer payments in the ohio electric aggregation program 
this resulted in the customer remittances being applied first to the customer s current and past due balances with the utility and then to the customer s current and past due balance with wps energy services 
wps energy services has established an allowance for doubtful accounts of million related to these delinquent receivables  resulting in a bad debt expense ratio which is considerably in excess of the ratio experienced by the serving utility 
wps energy services continues to experience bad debt in the program  but at a reduced rate as a result of consistently dropping delinquent customers from the program 
the public utility commission of ohio has proposed a payment hierarchy which is more equitable to the energy marketers 
the proposed payment hierarchy would help to reduce the level of delinquent receivables at wps energy services 
wps energy services filed a complaint and requested a hearing with the public utility commission of ohio to enforce a purchase of receivables provision that affects the aggregation program and on december   the ohio commission issued a ruling which would minimize the amount of exposure to delinquent receivables going forward through an interim purchase rate of for service rendered after the customers first scheduled meter read in we expect that this rate will be adjusted retroactively once a permanent settlement is reached 
in the absence of a favorable settlement  wps energy services will evaluate its participation in the ohio aggregation program once the current product price commitments expire 
wps energy services believes the reserve for delinquent receivables it has created is adequate 
basic generation service auction on february   wps energy services participated in a basic generation service auction conducted by the four regulated electric distribution companies in new jersey 
the auction allowed third party suppliers to bid for the right to serve a fixed percentage of the electric distribution companies basic generation service load 
wps energy services was awarded megawatts of fixed price load and megawatts of hourly priced load 
the hourly priced load will be supplied from wps power development s sunbury generation plant 
contracts have been executed with third party generation suppliers to provide energy for the fixed price load 
the supply contracts mirror wps energy services sales contracts to the electric distribution companies  providing effectively hedged transactions 
service to the new jersey electric distribution companies begins august  and ends may  wps energy services sales awarded under the basic generation service auction are to the regulated electric distribution companies  not to retail customers  thus eliminating direct retail customer credit risk 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments wps resources the following table summarizes the contractual obligations of wps resources  including its subsidiaries 
payments due by period contractual obligations as of december  millions total amounts committed less than year to years to years over years long term debt principal and interest payments operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations long term debt principal and interest payments represent bonds  notes  and loans held by wps resources and its subsidiaries 
we record all principal obligations on the balance sheet 
unconditional purchase obligations represent mainly commodity purchase contracts of wps resources and its subsidiaries 
the energy supply contracts at wps energy services have offsetting energy sale contracts 
wisconsin public service expects to recover the costs of its contracts in future customer rates 
as part of normal business  wps resources and its subsidiaries enter into various guaranties providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries 
these guaranties are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a stand alone basis  thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiaries intended commercial purposes 
the guaranties issued by wps resources include intercompany guaranties between parents and their subsidiaries  which are eliminated in consolidation  and guaranties of the company s own performance 
as such  all of wps resources guaranties are excluded from the recognition  measurement  and disclosure requirements of financial accounting standards board interpretation no

at december  and december   outstanding guaranties totaled million and million  respectively  as follows wps resources outstanding guaranties millions december  december  guaranties of subsidiary debt guaranties supporting commodity transactions of subsidiaries standby letters of credit surety bonds other guaranties total guaranties wps resources outstanding guaranties million total amounts committed at december  commitments expiring less than year to years to years over years guaranties of subsidiary debt guaranties supporting commodity transactions of subsidiaries standby letters of credit surety bonds other guaranties total guaranties at december   wps resources held million in corporate guaranties supporting indebtedness 
of that total  million supports outstanding debt at two wps power development s subsidiaries 
the underlying debt related to these guaranties is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
the wps resources board of directors has authorized management to issue corporate guaranties in the aggregate amount of up to million to support the business operations of wps energy services 
wps resources primarily issues the guaranties to counterparties in the wholesale electric and natural gas marketplace to meet the counter parties requirements and permit wps energy services to operate within these markets 
the amount of guaranties actually issued by wps resources to support the business operations at wps energy services at december  was million 
the amount supported is dependent on the amount of outstanding business wps energy services actually has with the counterparties holding the guaranties at any point in time 
wps resources reflects wps energy services obligations supported by these parental guaranties on its consolidated balance sheet either as accounts payable or liabilities from risk management activities 
the wps resources board of directors has authorized corporate guaranties as needed to support certain specific business operations of wps power development 
at december  wps resources issued million in corporate guaranties to support the business operation of wps power development  which are reflected in the above table 
wps resources issues the guaranties for indemnification obligations related to business purchase agreements and counter parties in the wholesale electric marketplace to meet their credit requirements and permit wps power development to operate within these markets 
the amount supported is dependent on the amount of the outstanding obligation that wps power development has with the parties holding the guaranties at any point in time 
wps resources reflects wps power development s obligations supported by these parental guaranties on its consolidated balance sheet as either accounts payable or other liabilities 
the remaining million of corporate guaranties consist of a million guaranty reflected on wisconsin public service s balance sheet supporting the termination agreement related to the acquisition of the de pere energy center and million of guaranties supporting operations at wps resources smaller subsidiaries 
wps resources issued million in standby letters of credit to financial institutions for the benefit of third parties that have extended credit to certain subsidiaries 
if a subsidiary does not pay amounts when due under a covered contract  the counterparty may present its claim for payment to the financial institution  which will request payment from wps resources 
any amounts owed by our subsidiaries are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   wps resources purchased million of surety bonds from the commonwealth of pennsylvania for waste management and disposal largely related to our wps power development operations in that state 
the remaining million of surety bonds were purchased for various purposes including worker compensation coverage and obtaining various licenses  permits and rights of way 
liabilities incurred as a result of activities covered by surety bonds are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
other guaranties of million listed on the above table include guaranties of subsidiary indebtedness that is available to the subsidiary but not outstanding as of december  since this amount is not outstanding at the end of the year  it is not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
wisconsin public service makes large investments in capital assets 
net construction expenditures  including nuclear fuel  are expected to be approximately million in the aggregate for the through period 
the public service commission of wisconsin has not yet approved some of these expenditures 
significant anticipated expenditures during this three year period include construction of generation facilities million automated meter reading million corporate services infrastructure million nuclear fuel million corporate software systems and hardware million security million nuclear reactor vessel head million combustion turbine million other capital requirements for the three year period include a contribution of million to the kewaunee plant s decommissioning trust fund 
upper peninsula power is expected to incur construction expenditures of about million in the aggregate for the period through  primarily for electric distribution improvements and repairs and safety measures at hydro facilities 
significant capital expenditures identified at wps power development for through include million at the sunbury facility  including million for handling nitrogen oxide emissions at the sunbury facility 
other capital expenditures for wps power development for through could be significant depending on its success in pursuing development and acquisition opportunities 
when appropriate  wps power development may seek nonrecourse financing for a portion of the cost of these acquisitions 
capital expenditures identified at wps energy services for through include million for software and systems upgrades 
wisconsin public service  along with co applicants minnesota power and american transmission company  continues to pursue the development of the mile  kilovolt wausau  wisconsin to duluth  minnesota transmission line and expects the project to proceed despite opposition primarily from local landowners  the citizens utility board  and environmental groups 
under an agreement recently reached with american transmission company  which will own and operate the completed line  wisconsin public service will be reimbursed for its project costs to date  approximately million  following approval of the agreement by the public service commission of wisconsin and the federal energy regulatory commission 
under the agreement  american transmission company will assume primary responsibility for the overall management of the project 
wisconsin public service will continue to be responsible for obtaining property rights necessary for the project and construction of the project 
wps resources will fund of future project costs and receive additional equity in american transmission company 
for the period through  we expect to make capital contributions of up to million for our portion of the wausau to duluth transmission line 
additional contributions will be required through to complete the transmission line 
wps resources may terminate its funding obligation if total project costs exceed the revised estimate of million announced by american transmission company on november  this updated cost estimate reflects additional costs to the project resulting from time delays  added regulatory requirements  changes and additions to the project at the request of local governments and american transmission company s management  and overhead costs 
the applicants filed petitions with the public service commission of wisconsin for approval to transfer primary responsibility for the project to american transmission company and the revised cost estimate 
we anticipate receiving approval of the agreement transferring primary responsibility for the project to american transmission company some time in we also anticipate receiving approval of project continuation with new cost estimates in completion of the line is expected in trading activities wps resources wps energy services currently measures the fair value of contracts  including nymex exchange and over the counter contracts  natural gas options  natural gas and electric power physical fixed price contracts  basis contracts  and related financial instruments on a mark to market basis using both quoted market prices and modeling techniques 
the primary input for natural gas pricing is the settled forward price curve of the nymex exchange which includes spreads  contracts  and options 
basis natural gas pricing is derived from published indices and documented broker quotes 
wps energy services bases electric prices on published indices and documented broker quotes 
the following table provides an assessment of the factors impacting the change in the net value of wps energy services assets and liabilities from risk management during the months ended december  wps energy services  inc mark to market roll forward millions natural gas electric total fair value of contracts at january  less contracts realized or settled during period plus fair value of new contracts entered into during period changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions other changes in fair value fair value of contracts outstanding at december  the fair value of contracts at january  and december   reflect the values reported on the balance sheet for net mark to market assets and liabilities as of those dates 
contracts realized or settled include the value of contracts in existence at january  that were no longer included in the net mark to market assets as of december  mark to market gains and losses related to contracts  that were entered into subsequent to january   and are still included in wps energy services portfolio at december   are included in the fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 
these amounts include amounts paid for the purchase of energy contracts and the mark to market gain or loss at the inception of these contracts 
there were  in many cases  offsetting positions entered into and settled during the period resulting in gains or losses being realized during the current period 
the realized gains or losses from these offsetting positions are not reflected in the table above 
although wps energy services strives to maintain a balanced book of back to back transactions  any ineffectiveness from its risk management activity for has been included under fair value of new contracts entered into during period in the table above 
the other changes in fair value line in the table primarily represents the change in the fair value of gas storage contracts from january  and december   the acquisition of a retail gas portfolio in canada  and the accounting consolidation of the quest electric portfolio 
in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles  wps energy services adjusts the value of natural gas storage at the end of each reporting period to fair value 
the january  amount has been revised to include the adjustment to fair value of the natural gas storage 
in october  the emerging issues task force issue issues related to accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  rescinded issue  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  which required energy trading contacts to be accounted for at fair value 
the rescission was effective immediately for new contracts entered into after october  wps energy services accounted for those energy trading contracts which existed at october  at fair value at december  wps energy services  inc contract aging at fair value source of fair value millions maturity less than year maturity to years maturity to years maturity in excess of years total fair value prices actively quoted prices provided by external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods total fair value prices actively quoted includes nymex contracts 
prices provided by external sources includes basis swaps and over the counter contracts 
prices based on models and other valuation methods includes some retail natural gas and electric contracts due to the volume optionality that exists in those contracts 
we derive the pricing for all contracts in the above table from active quotes or external sources 
pricing is the most significant variable in the mark to market calculations 
critical accounting policies wps resources in may  the securities and exchange commission issued proposed rules regarding the identification and disclosure of accounting estimates a company makes in applying its accounting policies and the disclosure of initial adoption by a company of an accounting policy that has a material impact on its financial presentation 
under the first part of the proposal  a company would have to identify the accounting estimates reflected in its financial statements that required it to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time of estimation 
disclosures about those estimates would then be required if different estimates that the company reasonably could have used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the securities and exchange commission accepted comments on the proposed rules through july  and has not made any final decisions since that time 
in anticipation of at least parts of this proposed rule being made final  we have identified the following accounting policies to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain 
price risk activities the fair values of commodity and trading contracts recorded for wps resources under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and emerging issues task force issue  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  are based on estimates that are critical to our financial statements 
fair value is determined using internal models  third party quotes or a combination of the two methods 
changes in the expected energy and gas market prices could cause variability to the fair values of the derivatives 
such changes would be reflected on the balance sheets  statements of income  and or as a component of other comprehensive income 
as a component of the fair value determination  wps energy services maintains reserves to account for the estimated costs of servicing and holding certain of its contracts  the reserves are based on estimates of administrative costs  credit counter party risk  and servicing margin with both fixed and variable components 
variability can occur if fundamental changes in service cost or risk require an adjustment to the reserve components 
the estimates were derived from historical data 
the following table shows the effect of changing both the administrative costs and credit counter party risk assumptions 
change in assumption effect to operating reserve increase million decrease million these potential changes to the operating reserve would be shown as part of the nonregulated cost of fuel  gas and purchased power on the consolidated statements of income and liabilities from risk management activities on the consolidated balance sheets 
acquisitions the methodology that wps resources uses to account for wps power development s acquisitions employs a number of steps  the first relates to the allocation of the initial purchase price 
an independent appraiser is retained to allocate the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities  if any  acquired in the acquisition using statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as guidance 
the appraiser uses a combination of the following three methodologies to calculate fair market value replacement cost  discounted cash flows  and recent sales of similar assets in the specific geographic region 
wps power development management reviews these calculations 
once the purchase price has been allocated to the various asset classes  engineers from wps power development assist in the assignment of depreciation lives for the various assets acquired 
industry standards  physical condition  and company experience with various assets are used as a basis for developing the respective depreciation lives 
a significant change in these estimates would impact reported income  either higher or lower depending on the change to the depreciable life  as well as impacting the carrying value of these assets on the balance sheet 
asset impairment wps resources annually reviews its assets for impairment 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  are the basis for these analyses 
the review for impairment of tangible assets is more critical to wps power development than to our other segments because of its significant investment in property  plant  and equipment and lack of access to regulatory relief that is available to our regulated segments 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment of power plants is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate is susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about market sales pricing  production costs  and generation volumes and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet and the net loss on our income statement could be material 
management s assumptions about future market sales prices and generation volumes require significant judgment because actual market sales prices and generation volumes have fluctuated in the past as a result of changing fuel costs  environmental changes  and required plant maintenance and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the primary estimates used at wps power development in this process are future revenue streams and operating costs 
a combination of input from both internal and external sources is used to project revenue streams 
wps power development s operations group projects future operating costs with input from external sources for fuel costs and forward energy prices 
these estimates are modeled over the projected remaining life of the power plants using the model defined in statement no 
wps power development evaluates property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
statement requires that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a company s asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of impairment recognized is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the carrying value of the asset 
wps power development owns nine power plants 
six power plants  including the sunbury generating plant  were reviewed for impairment as of september  we determined that the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from the property  plant  and equipment as of september   exceeded the carrying value of those assets 
the sunbury generating plant represents of wps resources property  plant  and equipment 
at september   the estimate of future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  was greater than the million carrying value of the sunbury generating plant 
any increases in estimated future cash flows would have no impact on the carrying value of the sunbury generating plant 
an increase of in fuel expenses or a increase in operating expenses would result in decreased future cash flows  but would also have no impact on the carrying value of the sunbury generating plant 
in contrast  a decrease of in revenue rates would reduce the estimate of future cash flows to less than the carrying value of the sunbury generating plant 
in that case  an impairment loss would be recognized that would have reduced wps resources total assets at december  by and decreased income before taxes for the year by 
the merger of wisconsin fuel and light into wisconsin public service in resulted in wisconsin public service recording goodwill related to its gas utility segment 
the goodwill is tested for impairment yearly based on the guidance of statement no 
the test for impairment includes assumptions about future profitability of the gas utility segment and the correlation between our gas utility segment and published projections for other similar gas utility segments 
a significant change in the gas utility market and or our projections of future profitability could result in a loss being recorded on the income statement related to a decrease in the goodwill asset  as a result of the impairment test 
accruals our regulated gas and electric utilities and wps energy services accrue estimated amounts of revenue for services rendered but not yet billed 
estimated unbilled sales are calculated using actual generation and throughput volumes  recorded sales  and weather factors 
the estimated unbilled sales are assigned different rates based on historical customer class allocations 
any difference between actual sales and the estimates or weather factors would cause a change in the estimated revenue 
wps resources reserves for potential uncollectible customer accounts as an expense on the income statement and an uncollectible reserve on the balance sheet 
due to the nature of the nonregulated energy marketing business having higher credit risk  the reserve is more critical to wps energy services than to our other segments 
at wps energy services  the reserve is based on historical uncollectible experience and specific customer identification where practical 
if the assumption that historical uncollectible experience matches current customer default is incorrect  or if a specific customer with a large account receivable that has not previously been identified as a risk defaults  there could be significant changes to the expense and uncollectible reserve balance 
accruals for pension and postretirement benefits the costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits and other postretirement benefits described in note to the consolidated financial statements  are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension costs  for example  are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels  and employment periods  the level of contributions we make to the plan  and earnings on plan assets 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension costs 
pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
other postretirement benefit costs  for example  are impacted by actual employee demographics including age and compensation levels  the level of contributions we make to the plans  earnings on plan assets  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future other postretirement benefit costs 
other postretirement benefit costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  health care cost trend rates  and the discount rates used in determining the postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement costs 
wps resources pension plan assets and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded pension costs 
changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates  health care cost trend rates  and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded other postretirement benefit costs 
management believes that such changes in costs would be recovered at our regulated segments through the ratemaking process 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage 
the chart below reflects an increase or decrease in the percentage for each assumption  and how each change would impact the projected benefit obligation  our reported prepaid pension asset on the balance sheet  and our reported annual pension cost on the income statement as they relate to our two large qualified pension plans

in selecting an assumed rate of return on plan assets  we consider past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan 
the market value of wps resources plan assets was affected by sharp declines in equity markets since the third quarter of for the past three years  pension plan assets earned million in and lost million and million in and  respectively 
as a result of our plan asset return experience and the declining interest rate environment  we could be required in some future period to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by statement no 
the liability would be recorded as an intangible asset and a possible reduction to common equity through a charge to other comprehensive income 
the charge to other comprehensive income would be restored through common equity in future periods to the extent fair value of trust assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation 
also  pension cost and cash funding requirements could increase in future years without improved asset returns 
for the past three years  other postretirement benefit plan assets earned million in and lost million and million in and  respectively 
in selecting assumed health care cost trend rates  we consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs 
wps resources adjusted its health care cost trend rates upwards each of the last two years in an attempt to keep our health care cost trend rates in line with the rapidly increasing health care costs the country and wps resources have faced 
also  other postretirement benefit cost and cash funding could increase in future years without improved asset returns 
regulatory accounting the electric and gas utility segments of wps resources follow statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and our financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments 
we defer certain expenses and revenues that regulators have authorized for deferral as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities 
future recovery of deferred expenses recorded as regulatory assets is not assured  but is subject to review by regulators in a rate proceeding for prudence and reasonableness 
management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
once approved  we recognize these deferred expenses in income over the rate recovery period 
if not approved  these deferred expenses would be recognized in income in the then current period 
if our electric and gas utility segments no longer meet the criteria for applying statement no 
 we would discontinue its application as defined under statement no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of fasb statement no 
assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation may no longer be recognized on the balance sheet and would be classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurs 
a write off of all wps resources regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at december  would result in a decrease in total assets  a decrease in total liabilities and shareholders equity  and a decrease in income before taxes 
tax provision estimates of current and future year taxable income are used to determine the estimated period ended income tax provision  including determining the estimated current and future tax benefit of federal and state tax credits produced in the period 
the income tax provision also includes an estimate of the future tax benefit related to state net operating loss carryovers 
determination of current year taxable income and the ability to utilize tax credits and net operating loss carryovers will not be settled until several years after the close of the tax year 
estimates of future year taxable income reflect management s current understanding of the economics related to projected operations and markets 
changes in either estimate of taxable income could cause a significant change in management s estimated income tax provision 
related party transactions wps resources wps resources has investments in related parties which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
these include the investment at wps investment  llc  a consolidated subsidiary of wisconsin public service  in american transmission company llc and wisconsin public service s investment in wisconsin river power company 
wisconsin public service recorded revenues from american transmission of million in and million in wisconsin public service recorded transmission expenses from american transmission of million in and million in upper peninsula power recorded revenues from american transmission of million in and million in upper peninsula power recorded transmission expenses from american transmission of million in and million in wisconsin public service recorded revenues from wisconsin river power of million in and million in wisconsin public service recorded power purchases from wisconsin river power of million in and million in trends wps resources environmental we are subject to federal  state  and local regulations regarding environmental impacts of our operations on air and water quality and solid waste 
the application of federal and state restrictions to protect the environment can involve review  certification  or issuance of permits by various federal and state authorities  including the united states environmental protection agency and the various states environmental agencies  including the wisconsin department of natural resources 
these restrictions may limit  prevent  or substantially increase the cost of the operation of generation facilities and may require substantial investments in new equipment at existing installations 
such restrictions may require substantial additional investments for new projects and may delay or prevent completion of projects 
we cannot forecast the effects of such regulation on our generation  transmission  and other facilities or operations 
wisconsin public service continues to investigate the environmental cleanup of ten manufactured gas plant sites  two of which were previously owned by wisconsin fuel and light 
wisconsin public service anticipates that work will commence on the land portion of the green bay site in costs of previous cleanups were within the range expected for these sites 
the united states environmental protection agency has designated southeastern wisconsin as an ozone non attainment area 
under the clean air act  the state of wisconsin developed a nitrogen oxide reduction plan for wisconsin s ozone non attainment area 
this plan affects edgewater unit  of which wisconsin public service owns 
a compliance plan for this unit includes a combination of combustion optimization and emission trading at a cost to wisconsin public service of about million 
about of the project has been completed 
in addition  wisconsin public service is participating in voluntary efforts to reduce nitrogen oxide levels at the columbia energy center 
wisconsin public service owns of columbia 
the public service commission of wisconsin has approved recovery of the costs associated with voluntary nitrogen oxide reductions 
air quality modeling by the wisconsin department of natural resources revealed that weston units and contribute to a modeled exceedance of the sulfur dioxide ambient air quality standard 
wisconsin public service is cooperating with the wisconsin department of natural resources to develop an approach to resolve this issue 
the wisconsin department of natural resources initiated a rulemaking effort aimed at the control of mercury emissions 
wisconsin public service estimates that it could cost million per year for it to achieve the proposed mercury emission reductions of phased in over years 
energy and capacity prices prices for electric energy and capacity have been extremely volatile over the past two years 
wps resources nonregulated entities are impacted by this volatility which has been driven by the exit of many of the largest speculative traders  the slow down in the economy  and significant overbuilding of generation capacity 
although electric energy prices are currently favorable due to high natural gas prices  we expect that electric capacity prices will continue to be depressed for several years 
pressure on capacity prices will continue until existing reserve margins are depleted either by load growth or capacity retirements 
wps power development is impacted by pricing exhibited in the external marketplace but attempts to manage its assets with a combination of long and short term contracts 
wps power development attempts to execute bilateral contracts for a longer term and actively participates in real time markets for the short term 
wps energy services is not as affected by pricing pressures as it structures its deals with back to back transactions which hedge pricing changes 
credit risk companies participating in energy commodity markets face significant credit risk 
credit risk represents the potential loss should a counter party fail to perform under its contractual obligation 
credit assurance is often required when wps energy services enters into a transaction that creates a future obligation to a counter party 
wps energy services currently satisfies credit assurance through parental guaranties from wps resources 
wps energy services reduces the need for credit assurance through netting agreements 
these netting agreements allow wps energy services and the counter party to net their respective positions with each other  with only the party in the net owe position remitting payment to the other party 
another method of reducing the need for credit assurance is to employ multilateral netting through a credit clearing house 
by clearing transactions through a credit clearing house  only net credit positions are required to be posted 
the energy commodity industry views credit clearing as the preferred solution to the current credit environment which has barred many entities from participating in energy markets 
wps energy services extends credit to certain customers without specific assurances  such as parental guaranties 
wps energy services has stringent credit standards for its retail customers and also extends limited trade credit to wholesale market participants based on the credit rating of the entity 
industry restructuring the energy industry has been undergoing dramatic structural change for several years  resulting in increasing competitive pressure on electric and natural gas utility companies 
increased competition may create greater risks to the stability of utility earnings generally and may reduce future utility earnings from retail electric and natural gas sales 
the future of deregulation in the utility industry and its impact on our future is uncertain 
at the present time  wisconsin has not adopted legislation or regulations that would allow customers to choose their electric supplier 
all michigan electric customers were able to choose their electric generation suppliers beginning january  as a result of the customer choice act 
at this time  no customers have chosen an alternative electric supplier and no alternative electric suppliers have offered to serve any customers in michigan s upper peninsula 
to the extent competitive pressures increase and the pricing and sale of electricity assumes more of the characteristics of a commodity business  the economics of our business may come under increasing pressure 
in addition  regulatory changes may increase access to electric transmission grids by utility and nonutility purchasers and sellers of electricity  thus potentially resulting in a significant number of additional competitors in wholesale power generation 
in  the federal energy regulatory commission issued a notice of proposed rule making proposing a standard wholesale electric market design 
it is expected to take several years to implement and perfect the standard market design 
new accounting standards wps resources adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  on january  statement no 
requires legal asset retirement obligations to be recognized at fair value in the period incurred 
upon initial recognition of the asset retirement liability  the cost of the asset retirement is capitalized as part of the related long lived asset and depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
the liability is then accreted over time by applying the interest method of allocation to the liability 
following statement no 
 wisconsin public service identified the final decommissioning of its kewaunee plant as a legal retirement obligation and recorded a liability of approximately million as of january  amounts related to nuclear decommissioning previously recorded in accumulated depreciation approximately million were reclassified to the asset retirement obligation liability 
wisconsin public service did not have any cumulative effect of adopting the new statement to recognize in net income 
wps power development identified closure of an ash basin at the sunbury generation plant as an asset retirement obligation 
wps power development recognized an asset retirement obligation liability of million on january  and a negative after tax cumulative effect of adopting the new statement of million to net income 
the emerging issues task force issue  issues related to accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  requires revenues related to derivative instruments classified as trading to be reported net of related cost of sales both prospectively and retroactively 
under issue  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  wps energy services classified all its activities as trading 
consistent with issue  effective january   wps energy services classifies those transactions that are speculative in nature to be trading activities 
wps energy services does not anticipate that the classification of revenues and cost of sales under issue will be significantly different than its historical presentation prior to implementation of issue the emerging issues task force rescinded issue thus precluding mark to market accounting for energy trading contracts that are not derivatives 
at january   wps energy services reevaluated contracts entered into on or prior to october  under statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and recorded a positive after tax cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of approximately million to net income 
market growth wps energy services expects to continue expanding in the northeastern quadrant of the united states and adjacent portions of canada 
wps energy services is continuing to maintain a balance of retail and wholesale natural gas and electric business  utilizing wps power development s assets where applicable 
the addition of the canadian natural gas retail business to wps energy services portfolio and wps energy services geographical expansion into canadian markets has contributed to the balance between its wholesale and retail segments 
the integration of wps energy services marketing efforts and wps power development s generation efforts in maine continues to drive a large percentage of wps energy services retail electric margin 
wps energy services and wps power development are also working together in developing and executing strategies to improve the profitability of our pennsylvania generation plants and develop integrated market capabilities in new york 
equity markets due to the sharp declines in the united states equity markets since the third quarter of  the value of the assets held in our pension  postretirement and nuclear decommissioning trusts decreased 
as a result  additional contributions may be required in the future to meet our obligations to pay benefits  and to decommission the kewaunee plant 
wisconsin public service anticipates that any additional contributions to decommission the kewaunee plant would be recoverable through the ratemaking process 
likewise  additional expenses for pension and postretirement benefits related to regulated operations would likely be recovered in future rates 
impact of inflation wps resources our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and report operating results in terms of historic cost 
the statements provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
under rate treatment prescribed by utility regulatory commissions  wisconsin public service s and upper peninsula power s projected operating costs are recoverable in revenues 
because rate forecasting assumes inflation  most of the inflationary effects on normal operating costs are recoverable in rates 
however  in these forecasts  wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power are only allowed to recover the historic cost of plant via depreciation 
results of operations wisconsin public service corporation wisconsin public service corporation is a regulated electric and natural gas utility 
electric operations accounted for approximately of revenues in  while gas operations contributed to revenues 
compared with wisconsin public service corporation overview wisconsin public service s and results of operations are shown in the following table wisconsin public service s results millions change operating revenues earnings on common stock sales volume growth and wisconsin retail rate increases contributed to increased revenues in earnings from electric utility operations were million in compared with million in earnings from gas utility operations were million in compared with million in a full year contribution from gas utility operations acquired in the spring of  warmer than normal weather during the heating season in  and a rate increase approved by regulators resulted in increased earnings from gas utility operations in even with the rate increases approved by regulators  wisconsin public service was unable to earn the full return approved by them 
utility margins at wisconsin public service were impacted positively by a public service commission of wisconsin interim rate order which was effective january  authorizing a increase in wisconsin retail electric rates and a increase in wisconsin retail natural gas rates 
in late june  wisconsin public service received a final rate order which authorized a increase in wisconsin retail electric rates and a increase in wisconsin retail natural gas rates 
the final order authorized a lower retail natural gas rate increase than was approved in the interim order resulting in a million refund to wisconsin public service s natural gas customers 
electric utility margins wisconsin public service s electric utility margin increased million  or  in primarily due to the wisconsin retail electric rate increases 
electric utility results millions revenues fuel and purchased power margins sales in kilowatt hours wisconsin public service s electric utility revenues increased million  or  in as the result of the electric rate increases and an increase in overall electric sales volumes 
sales volumes were up for lower margin  wholesale customers while sales to higher margin  residential customers increased and sales to higher margin  commercial and industrial customers increased 
summer weather was warmer in than in  and warmer than normal 
increased fuel costs for power generation were partially offset by lower purchased power expenses 
wisconsin public service s fuel expense for generation plants increased million  or  in wisconsin public service s purchased power expense  however  decreased million  or  in overall generation from wisconsin public service s plants increased while purchased volumes decreased 
the change in the energy supply mix was largely due to the availability of less expensive power generation from the kewaunee nuclear power plant 
wisconsin public service increased its ownership interest in the kewaunee plant to in september the public service commission of wisconsin allows wisconsin public service to adjust prospectively the amount billed to wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range 
wisconsin public service is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus from forecasted costs on an annualized basis 
wisconsin public service did not submit any fuel filings in gas utility margins effective april   the gas utility margin at wisconsin public service includes the merged wisconsin fuel and light company operations 
wisconsin public service corporation s gas utility results millions revenues purchase costs margins throughput in therms an increase in overall natural gas throughput volumes of and the wisconsin retail gas rate increase resulted in a higher gas utility margin of million  or  in increased overall gas throughput volumes were partially the result of including months of operations for former wisconsin fuel and light in compared with the inclusion of months of operations in gas throughput volumes were also affected by a heating season that was colder in than in  but milder than normal 
wisconsin public service s gas revenues decreased million  or  in and gas purchase costs decreased million  or  largely as the result of a decrease in the average unit cost of natural gas in wisconsin public service passes changes in the cost of gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause  as allowed by the public service commission of wisconsin and the michigan public service commission under current regulatory practice 
other utility expenses income utility operating expense increased million in largely due to amortization of regulatory deferrals  increased benefit costs  higher transmission expenses associated with american transmission company  increased expenses at the kewaunee plant as a result of wisconsin public service acquiring additional ownership interest in the plant  and increased energy conservation expenses 
utility depreciation and decommissioning expense increased million in largely due to additional plant assets at wisconsin public service  including its increased ownership interest in the kewaunee plant 
lower depreciation expense of million in related to decreased decommissioning earnings partially offset the increased plant asset depreciation 
other utility income decreased in primarily as the result of lower earnings of million on wisconsin public service s nuclear decommissioning trust assets 
due to regulatory practice  a decrease in earnings on the trust assets is largely offset by decreased depreciation expense 
other nonutility income wps resources asset management strategy resulted in pretax gains of million at wisconsin public service in compared with pretax gains of approximately million in wps resources asset management strategy  which was initiated in  is a five to seven year plan intended to optimize shareholder return from the sale  development  or use of certain assets 
in addition  earnings on equity investments were higher in compared with primarily due to the investment in american transmission company 
compared with wisconsin public service corporation overview wisconsin public service s and results of operations are shown in the following table wisconsin public service s results millions change operating revenues earnings on common stock sales volume growth  rate increases  and higher natural gas prices in the first part of contributed to increased revenues 
the public service commission of wisconsin authorized a increase in wisconsin retail electric rates and a increase in wisconsin retail natural gas rates effective january  earnings from electric utility operations were million in compared with million in earnings from gas utility operations were million in and million in other nonutility income from the gain on the sale of hydro lands as part of wps resources asset management strategy and increased utility margins contributed to higher overall earnings in partially offsetting these factors were increased operating expenses 
electric utility margins wisconsin public service s electric utility margin increased million  or  in primarily due to a wisconsin retail electric rate increase  which became effective on january   and higher sales volumes to most customer classes 
summer weather was warmer in than in  and warmer than normal 
partially offsetting these factors was a decrease in sales to large commercial and industrial customers due to declining economic conditions 
also affecting the electric utility margin was a change in the customer mix 
sales to lower margin  non firm customers increased more than sales to higher margin customers 
wisconsin public service s fuel expense for production plants decreased million  or  in largely due to decreased production at its combustion turbine generation plants 
wisconsin public service s purchased power expense  however  increased million in due to an increase in power purchases and a increase in the cost per kilowatt hour of power purchases made in power purchases were higher in due to warmer summer weather and the availability of economically priced energy 
also contributing to increased power purchases were a scheduled outage at wisconsin public service s nuclear plant and an unscheduled outage at one of its fossil fueled generation plants 
wisconsin public service s kewaunee plant was off line for a scheduled refueling and replacement of its steam generators in late september the kewaunee plant returned to service in early december as scheduled 
wisconsin public service is a owner of the kewaunee plant 
wisconsin public service s pulliam unit was off line for unscheduled repairs in the fourth quarter of and returned to service in february wisconsin public service chose to take advantage of purchased power during these outages because of economically favorable pricing 
the public service commission of wisconsin allows wisconsin public service to adjust prospectively the amount billed to wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range 
in the third quarter of  wisconsin public service submitted a fuel filing with the public service commission of wisconsin requesting a million retail electric rate reduction 
the rate reduction was approved and implemented on september  wisconsin public service submitted an additional fuel filing in november  and a rate reduction of million was approved and implemented on december  gas utility margins effective april   the gas utility margin at wisconsin public service includes the merged wisconsin fuel and light company operations 
the gas utility margin at wisconsin public service increased million  or  in this increase was due to a increase in wisconsin retail natural gas rates effective january   and a increase in overall natural gas throughput volumes 
increased gas throughput volumes were largely the result of wisconsin public service s acquisition of wisconsin fuel and light in the second quarter of gas throughput volumes to large commercial and industrial customers  however  decreased in as a result of customers switching to the gas transport customer class and declining economic conditions 
gas throughput volumes to gas transport customers increased in in addition  gas throughput volumes to interruptible customers decreased in gas throughput volumes were negatively affected by winter weather  which was milder in than in and milder than normal 
wisconsin public service s natural gas revenues increased million  or  as the result of an increase in the average unit cost of natural gas in the first half of  increased throughput as a result of wisconsin public service s acquisition of wisconsin fuel and light in the second quarter of  and the increase in wisconsin retail gas rates 
wisconsin public service s natural gas purchase costs increased million  or  largely due to a higher average unit cost of natural gas in the first half of the higher natural gas prices experienced earlier in were passed on to customers and are reflected in both revenues and gas purchases  thus having little impact on margin 
other utility expenses income utility operating expenses increased million in largely due to increased transmission expenses associated with the transfer of assets to american transmission company  increased payments to the wisconsin department of administration for energy conservation activities  increased maintenance costs at the kewaunee plant during its refueling outage  and higher write offs of uncollectible accounts 
the public service commission of wisconsin allowed a portion of the higher transmission costs to be deferred 
the deferred transmission costs  million for  were recovered in wisconsin retail rates 
lower earnings on the nuclear decommissioning fund contributed to a decrease in other income from utility operations in due to regulatory practice  lower earnings on the nuclear decommissioning fund were largely offset by decreased depreciation expense 
an extension in the kewaunee plant s assumed depreciable life and a reduction in the nuclear decommissioning fund contribution also contributed to decreased depreciation expense in interest expense increased due to the issuance of additional long term debt by wisconsin public service in august other nonutility income other nonutility income included pretax gains of approximately million  including a pretax gain of million on the sale of hydro lands in december the sale of these hydro lands was a significant transaction in wps resources five to seven year asset management strategy to optimize shareholder return from the sale  development  or use of certain assets 
in addition  earnings on equity investments were higher in compared with primarily due to the investment in american transmission company 
balance sheet wisconsin public service compared with net utility plant increased million in due to additional plant assets  including construction of portions of the pulliam combustion turbine and the wausau to duluth transmission line 
customer and other receivables increased million in and accrued utility revenues increased million  both as the result of increased sales volumes due to colder weather 
wisconsin retail rate increases also contributed to these higher balances 
long term debt increased million in due to the issuance of secured notes  partially offset by the retirement of first mortgage bonds 
the capital lease obligation was extinguished upon the purchase of the de pere energy center 
accounts payable increased million in largely due to the million payable as the result of wisconsin public service s purchase of the de pere energy center in december increased natural gas purchases as the result of colder weather also contributed to the higher accounts payable balance 
liquidity and capital resources wisconsin public service financing wisconsin public service normally uses internally generated funds and commercial paper borrowing to satisfy most of its capital requirements 
wisconsin public service may periodically issue long term debt  receive equity contributions from wps resources  or make payments for return of capital to wps resources to reduce short term debt  fund future growth  and maintain capitalization ratios as authorized by the public service commission of wisconsin 
wisconsin public service completed the syndication of a revolving credit line of million in the third quarter of the current credit ratings for wisconsin public service are listed in the table below 
credit ratings standard poor s moody s wisconsin public service corporation bonds preferred stock commercial paper credit line syndication aa a a aa a p aa wisconsin public service believes these ratings are among the best in the energy industry and have allowed it to access commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable terms 
credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  are subject to change  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
wisconsin public service issued million of year senior notes in december under a shelf registration for the offering and sale of up to million in long term debt 
the senior notes are secured by a pledge of first mortgage bonds and may become unsecured if wisconsin public service retires all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds 
wisconsin public service used approximately million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to acquire the de pere energy center and million to retire short term debt 
the balance of the net proceeds was used for other corporate purposes 
wisconsin public service retired million of first mortgage bonds in october an additional million of first mortgage bonds were retired on february  wisconsin public service expects to issue additional debt in regulatory on march   wisconsin public service filed an application with the public service commission of wisconsin to modify its wisconsin retail electric and natural gas rates for and in order to ensure reliable energy into the future and to recover increased costs  wisconsin public service requested retail electric rate increases of in and in and retail natural gas rate increases of in and in wisconsin public service requested a return on equity  with equity constituting of the capital structure 
on february   the public service commission of wisconsin ruled on the requested rate increase  including a return on equity with no change in the capital structure 
a final order is anticipated by mid march on february   wisconsin public service filed an application with the michigan public service commission for new electric rates for its michigan retail customers 
wisconsin public service requested a increase in michigan electric rates  its first request since since it is uncertain as to when the michigan public service commission will review its request  wisconsin public service also filed for a interim rate increase 
if approved  the interim rates will be in effect until final rates are approved 
wisconsin public service intends to file for an increase in wholesale electric rates with the federal energy regulatory commission in the first quarter of if the filing meets all the necessary criteria  new rates could be implemented  subject to refund  as early as sixty one days after the initial filing 
if the rate case is litigated to a conclusion  the process could take up to three years to complete 
asset sales  acquisitions  and construction on september   wisconsin public service received a certificate of authority from the public service commission of wisconsin to construct an megawatt combustion turbine unit at its pulliam plant location 
construction of the unit  which is expected to cost approximately million  should be complete in june on december   wisconsin public service purchased the megawatt de pere energy center and terminated the related existing purchased power agreement 
wisconsin public service paid million at the close of the transaction with the remaining million due in december as a result of this transaction  wisconsin public service extinguished its capital lease obligation and entered into a purchased power agreement for up to megawatts from a plant yet to be constructed 
the new purchased power agreement is contingent on timely plant construction 
wisconsin public service expects to recover a substantial portion of the remaining payment in future customer rates 
as part of its regulated utility operations  wisconsin public service expects to submit an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to the public service commission of wisconsin in late for approval to build a megawatt coal fired generation facility near wausau  wisconsin 
wisconsin public service anticipates receiving approval from the public service commission of wisconsin in the facility is estimated to cost approximately million  assuming the public service commission of wisconsin allows a current return on construction costs 
the facility will be funded with internally generated funds  debt issues  and equity 
wps resources may need to issue additional common stock to fund equity to wisconsin public service 
in december wisconsin public service sold approximately  acres of land on the peshtigo river in northeastern wisconsin to the wisconsin department of natural resources for million 
this sale was a significant transaction in wps resources five to seven year asset management strategy which was initiated in the agreement with the department of natural resources includes two options  one exercisable in and the other in  whereby the department may acquire  at less than fair value  approximately  additional acres for million if both options are exercised 
the value associated with the difference between the option price and the fair value will be treated as a charitable contribution 
as part of wps resources asset management strategy  wisconsin public service sold additional assets in for gains of million

critical accounting policies wisconsin public service in may  the securities and exchange commission issued proposed rules regarding the identification and disclosure of accounting estimates a company makes in applying its accounting policies and the disclosure of initial adoption by a company of an accounting policy that has a material impact on its financial presentation 
under the first part of the proposal  a company would have to identify the accounting estimates reflected in its financial statements that required it to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time of estimation 
disclosures about those estimates would then be required if different estimates that the company reasonably could have used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the securities and exchange commission accepted comments on the proposed rules through july  and has not made any final decisions since that time 
in anticipation of at least parts of this proposed rule being made final  we have identified the following accounting policies to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain 
price risk activities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  wisconsin public service records its derivatives at fair value 
these amounts are calculated using estimates that are critical to the financial statements 
fair value of the derivatives is calculated using internal models  third party quotes  or a combination of the two methods 
changes in the expected electric and gas market prices could cause variability in the fair values of the derivatives 
because wisconsin public service has regulatory approval to offset the changes in the fair value of derivatives with a regulatory asset or liability  such changes would be reflected on the consolidated balance sheets only 
asset impairment the merger of wisconsin fuel and light into wisconsin public service in resulted in wisconsin public service recording goodwill related to its gas utility segment 
the goodwill is tested for impairment yearly based on the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the test for impairment includes assumptions about future profitability of the gas utility segment and the correlation between the gas utility segment and published projections for other similar gas utility segments 
a significant change in the gas utility market and or internal projections of future profitability could result in a loss being recorded on the income statement related to a decrease in the goodwill asset  as a result of the impairment test 
accruals wisconsin public service accrues estimated amounts of revenue for services rendered but not yet billed based on estimated unbilled sales 
estimated unbilled sales are calculated using actual generation and throughput volumes  recorded sales and weather factors 
the estimated unbilled sales are assigned different rates based on historical customer class allocations 
any difference between actual sales and the estimates or weather factors would cause a change in the estimated revenue 
accruals for pension and postretirement benefits wisconsin public service estimates its benefit obligations using assumptions about discount rates  future salary increases  expected returns on plan assets  and medical and dental cost trend rates 
these assumptions are disclosed annually in our annual report on form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
changes in the economy can cause adjustments in the assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations and would affect the related liabilities and expenses 
for a more detailed sensitivity analysis see wps resources management s discussion and analysis of critical accounting policies 
regulatory accounting the electric and gas utility segments of wisconsin public service follow statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and our financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments 
we defer certain expenses and revenues that regulators have authorized for deferral as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities 
future recovery of deferred expenses recorded as regulatory assets is not assured  but is subject to review by regulators in a rate proceeding for prudence and reasonableness 
management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
once approved  we recognize these deferred expenses in income over the rate recovery period 
if not approved  these deferred expenses would be recognized in income in the then current period 
if our electric and gas utility segments no longer meet the criteria for applying statement no 
 we would discontinue its application as defined under statement no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of fasb statement no 
assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation may no longer be recognized on the balance sheet and would be classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurs 
a write off of all wisconsin public service s regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at december  would result in a decrease in total assets  a decrease in total liabilities and shareholders equity  and a decrease in earnings on common stock 
related party transactions wisconsin public service wisconsin public service has investments in related parties which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
these include the investment at wps investments  llc  a consolidated subsidiary of wisconsin public service  in american transmission company llc  and wisconsin public service s investment in wisconsin river power company 
wisconsin public service also enters into transactions with upper peninsula power and wps energy services  which are both wholly owned subsidiaries of wps resources 
wisconsin public service recorded revenues from american transmission of million in and million in wisconsin public service recorded transmission expenses from american transmission of million in and million in wisconsin public service recorded revenues from wisconsin river power of million in and million in wisconsin public service recorded power purchases from wisconsin river power of million in and million in wisconsin public service recorded revenue from upper peninsula power of million in and million in wisconsin public service recorded revenue from wps energy services of million in and million in wisconsin public service recorded purchases from wps energy services of million in and million in trends wisconsin public service see wps resources management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information regarding trends

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks wps resources has potential market risk exposures related to commodity price risk  interest rate risk  equity return  and principal preservation risk 
the current exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is not significant 
wps resources has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures 
interest rate risk wps resources and wisconsin public service are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from their variable rate long term debt and short term commercial paper borrowing 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
wps resources and wisconsin public service enter into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so 
wps resources and wisconsin public service may also enter into derivative financial instruments  such as swaps  to mitigate interest rate exposure 
at december  and  wps resources utilized one interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on a variable rate loan at one of its nonregulated subsidiaries 
based on the variable rate debt of wps resources and wisconsin public service outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points in would increase annual interest expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
comparatively  based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased interest expense in by approximately million and million 
these hypothetical changes are based on certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would take action to mitigate wps resources and wisconsin public service s exposure to the change 
commodity price risk wps resources is exposed to commodity price risk resulting from the impact of market fluctuations in the price of certain commodities  including but not limited to electricity  natural gas  coal  fuel oil  and uranium  which are used and or sold by our subsidiaries in the normal course of their business 
we employ established policies and procedures to reduce the market risk associated with changing commodity prices  including using various types of commodity and derivative instruments 
wps resources exposure to commodity price risk in its regulated utilities is significantly mitigated by the current ratemaking process for the recovery of its electric fuel and purchased energy costs as well as its cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
therefore  the value at risk amounts discussed below do not include measures for wps resources regulated utilities 
to further manage commodity price risk  our regulated utilities enter into contracts of various duration for the purchase and or sale of natural gas  fuel for electric generation  and electricity 
wps power development utilizes purchase and or sale contracts for electric fuel and electricity to help manage its commodity price risk 
wps energy services uses derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market risk associated with the changing prices of natural gas and electricity sold at firm prices to customers 
wps energy services also utilizes these instruments to manage market risk associated with anticipated energy purchases 
for purposes of risk management disclosure  wps power development s and wps energy services activities are classified as non trading 
the value at risk amounts discussed below are presented separately for both wps power development and wps energy services due to the differing market and timing exposures of each entity 
value at risk to measure commodity price risk exposure  wps resources performs a value at risk var analysis of its exposures 
var is used to describe a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk 
the var amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from adverse changes in market factors  within a given confidence level  if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period 
var models are relatively sophisticated 
however  the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model 
the instruments being used may have features that could trigger a potential loss in excess of the calculated amount if the changes in the underlying commodity price exceed the confidence level of the model used 
var is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
at wps resources  var is estimated using a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a confidence level 
the delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods  such as one day  are normally distributed 
it does not take into account higher order risk exposures  so it may not provide a good approximation of the risk in a portfolio with substantial option positions 
we utilized a delta normal approximation because our portfolio has limited exposure to optionality 
our var calculation includes derivative financial and commodity instruments  such as forwards  futures  swaps  and options as well as commodities held in inventory  such as natural gas held in storage to the extent such positions are significant 
our var amount for wps energy services was calculated to be million at both december  and december  our var amount for wps power development was calculated to be million at december  compared with million at december  this decrease was primarily due to decreased volatility in our forward price curve for electricity and a decrease in the exposure period for some assets  both of which are used in our var calculation 
a significant portion of this var amount is mitigated by wps power development s generating capabilities  which are excluded from the var calculation as required by the securities and exchange commission rules 
for the year ended december   the average  high  and low var amounts for wps energy services were million  million  and million  respectively 
the same amounts for the year ended december  were million  million  and million 
for the year ended december   the average  high  and low var amounts for wps power development were million  million  and million  respectively 
the same amounts for the year ended december  were million  million  and million 
the average  high  and low amounts were computed using the var amounts at the beginning of the reporting period and the four quarter end amounts 
equity return and principal preservation risk wps resources and wisconsin public service currently fund liabilities related to employee benefits and nuclear decommissioning through various external trust funds 
these funds are managed by various investment managers and hold investments in debt and equity securities 
changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
the qualified pension liability is currently over funded and no contributions to the plan are required 
however  continued declines in the equity markets or continued declines in interest rates may result in increased future pension costs and possible future required contributions 
changes in the market value of investments related to other employee benefits or nuclear decommissioning could also impact future contributions 
wps resources monitors the trust fund portfolios by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices 
all decommissioning costs and most of the employee benefit costs relate to wps resources regulated utilities 
as such  the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates  mitigating the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures 
foreign currency exchange rate risk wps resources is exposed to foreign currency risk as a result of foreign operations owned and operated in canada and transactions denominated in canadian dollars for the purchase and sale of gas by one of our nonregulated subsidiaries 
wps resources has processes in place to protect against this risk 
the risk to wps resources is not significant at december
