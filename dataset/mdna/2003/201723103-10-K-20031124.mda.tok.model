this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this annual report 
we manufacture  recycle  market and distribute steel and metal products through a network of over locations in the united states and internationally 
manufacturing operations we conduct our manufacturing operations through the following steel mills  commonly referred to as minimills  that produce reinforcing bar  angles  flats  small beams  rounds  fence post sections and other shapes steel plants that bend  cut and fabricate steel  primarily reinforcing bar and angles plant that produces copper tubing warehouses that sell or rent supplies for the installation of concrete plants that produce special sections for floors and ceiling support plants that produce steel fence posts plant that treats steel with heat to strengthen and provide flexibility plant that rebuilds railcars railroad salvage company recycling operations we conduct our recycling operations through metal processing plants located in the states of texas  south carolina  florida  north carolina  oklahoma  kansas  missouri  tennessee  louisiana and georgia 
marketing and distribution operations we market and distribute steel  copper and aluminum coil  sheet and tubing  ores  metal concentrates  industrial minerals  ferroalloys and chemicals through our network of marketing and distribution offices  processing facilities and joint ventures around the world 
our customers use these products in a variety of industries 
you should read this management s discussion and analysis in connection with your review of our consolidated audited financial statements and the accompanying footnotes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following are important accounting policies  estimates and assumptions that you should understand as you review our financial statements 
we apply these accounting policies and make these estimates and assumptions to prepare financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles 
our use of these accounting policies  estimates and assumptions affects our results of operations and our reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
where we have used estimates or assumptions  actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
revenue recognition generally  we recognize sales when title passes 
for a few of our steel fabrication operations  we recognize net sales and profits from certain long term fixed price contracts by the percentage of completion method 
in determining the amount of net sales to recognize  we estimate the total costs and profits expected to be recorded for the contract term and the recoverability of costs related to change orders 
these estimates could change  resulting in changes in our earnings 
contingencies we make accruals as needed for litigation  administrative proceedings  government investigations including environmental matters  and contract disputes 
we base our environmental liabilities on estimates regarding the number of sites for which we will be responsible  the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site  the portion of costs that we expect we will share with other parties and the timing of the remediation 
where timing of expenditures can be reliably estimated  we discount amounts to reflect our cost of capital over time 
we record these and other contingent liabilities when they are probable and when we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss 
where timing and amounts cannot be precisely estimated  we estimate a range  and we recognize the low end of the range without discounting 
also  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended august  inventory cost we determine inventory cost for most domestic inventories by the last in  first out method  or lifo 
at the end of each quarter  we estimate both inventory quantities and costs that we expect at the end of the fiscal year for these lifo calculations  and we record an amount on a pro rata basis 
these estimates could vary substantially from the actual year end results  causing an adjustment to cost of goods sold 
see note  quarterly financial data  to the consolidated financial statements 
we record all inventories at the lower of their cost or market value 
property  plant and equipment our manufacturing and recycling businesses are capital intensive 
we evaluate the value of these assets and other long lived assets whenever a change in circumstances indicates that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
some of the estimated values for assets that we currently use in our operations utilize judgments and assumptions of future undiscounted cash flows that the assets will produce 
if these assets were for sale  our estimates of their values could be significantly different because of market conditions  specific transaction terms and a buyer s different viewpoint of future cash flows 
also  we depreciate property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciable lives are based on our estimate of the assets economically useful lives 
to the extent that an asset s actual life differs from our estimate  there could be an impact on depreciation expense or a gain loss on the disposal of the asset in a later period 
we expense major maintenance costs as incurred 
other accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results of operations our management uses a non gaap measure  adjusted operating profit  to compare and evaluate the financial performance of our segments 
see note  business segments  to the consolidated financial statements 
we define adjusted operating profit as the sum of our earnings before income taxes and financing costs 
adjusted operating profit provides a core operational earnings measurement that compares segments without the need to adjust for federal  but more specifically  state taxes which have considerable variation between domestic jurisdictions 
tax regulations in international operations add additional complexity 
also  we exclude interest cost and discounts on the sales of accounts receivable in our calculation of adjusted operating profit 
the results are  therefore  without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed 
in the following table we are providing a reconciliation of the non gaap measure  adjusted operating profit loss to net earnings loss marketing and corporate and in millions manufacturing recycling distribution eliminations total year ended august  net earnings loss income taxes interest expense

adjusted operating profit loss year ended august  in millions except share data net sales    net earnings international sales  as of total lifo effect on net earnings expense income per diluted share lifo reserve of inventory on lifo the following events had a significant financial impact during our fiscal year ended august  as compared to our fiscal year we recorded a million after tax lifo expense per diluted share compared to million lifo expense per diluted share in our steel and copper tube minimills earnings decreased due primarily to higher scrap  utility and other input costs which were only partially offset by increased selling prices and higher shipments 
margins were lower at the steel group s fabrication operations due to lower selling prices in spite of higher shipments 
in  we recorded a million after tax gain from the sale of the assets of smi owen steel company 
adjusted operating profits in our recycling segment in almost tripled from due mostly to the rise in prices in steel ferrous scrap markets 
marketing and distribution s adjusted operating profit in was significantly higher than in  with most of the improvement in international markets 
market conditions were difficult during the year ended august   but our strategy of diversification  both in our vertical integration as well as in our product lines  enabled us to remain profitable 
throughout much of  our key markets  especially in the manufacturing segment  were very competitive  although conditions improved during the fourth quarter 
public construction and institutional building remained fairly strong 
however  construction for factories  offices and other commercial buildings in the united states was significantly lower for the second consecutive year 
these conditions  along with higher input costs  resulted in substantially lower operating profits in at our mills and fabrication operations as compared to also  many of our international markets  except for china and australia  remained weak 
during the second half of fiscal  demand for our products increased  and we realized some benefit from the weaker us dollar 
our net earnings increased significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal  with net earnings for the three months ended august  totaling million as compared to million in segments unless otherwise indicated  all dollars below are before income taxes 
financial results for our reportable segments are consistent with the basis and manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information for making operating decisions 
we have three reportable segments manufacturing  recycling  and marketing and distribution 
the following table shows net sales and adjusted operating profit loss by business segment year ended august  in millions net sales manufacturing    recycling marketing and distribution  adjusted operating profit loss manufacturing recycling marketing and distribution compared to manufacturing we include our steel group and our copper tube division in our manufacturing segment 
adjusted operating profit is equal to earnings before income taxes for our four steel minimills  our copper tube mill and the steel group s fabrication operations 
our manufacturing adjusted operating profit for the year ended august  decreased million as compared to the sale of smi owen and a litigation settlement at the mills in accounted for million of the decrease 
excluding these items  adjusted operating profit decreased in as compared to net sales for the year ended august  decreased million as compared to steel mill selling prices were at very low levels for much of however  scrap purchase prices were driven sharply higher by offshore demand and the weakening value of the us dollar 
our steel minimills implemented higher selling prices that became partially effective during the second half of however  these price increases did not fully offset higher scrap and utility costs 
gross margins were significantly lower as a result of these conditions 
our copper tube mill s gross margins were also lower due to increased copper scrap purchase prices and lower selling prices for its products 
our steel group s fabrication operations were less profitable in as compared to primarily due to lower selling prices which more than offset the impact of higher shipments 
the table below reflects steel and scrap prices per ton august  dollars per ton average mill selling price total sales average mill selling price finished goods only average fabrication selling price average ferrous scrap purchase price minimills adjusted operating profit for our four steel minimills decreased million for the year ended august  as compared to the effect of valuing inventories under the lifo method accounted for million of the decrease in adjusted operating profit for the year ended august  as compared to also  during the year ended august   our steel minimills received million from a nonrecurring graphite electrode litigation settlement 
even excluding these items  adjusted operating profit in decreased as compared to because higher shipments and average selling prices were not enough to offset higher input costs  including scrap and utilities 
our adjusted operating profit at smi texas decreased to million for the year ended august  as compared to an adjusted operating profit of million in smi south carolina lost million for the year ended august  as compared to a million adjusted operating profit in higher scrap costs  higher energy costs and a weak demand for our products were the most significant reasons for smi south carolina s loss in although these factors were partially offset by price increases in the fourth quarter 
smi arkansas reported a thousand adjusted operating profit in as compared to a million adjusted operating profit in most of the decrease in adjusted operating profit at smi arkansas was attributable to lifo expense caused by higher year end inventories of rerolling rail 
however  adjusted operating profit at our smi alabama mill for the year ended august  increased to million as compared to million in cost reduction efforts  improved operating efficiencies  and better market conditions were the key factors in smi alabama s improved profitability 
our mills shipped  tons in  an increase of as compared to  tons shipped in  due largely to higher billet sales 
our mills rolled  tons  a decrease as compared to our minimills melted  tons during the year ended august   which was a decrease of as compared to our average total mill selling price at per ton increased as compared to our mill selling price for finished goods increased per ton in as compared to our average scrap purchase costs in increased per ton as compared to utility expenses increased by million for the year ended august  as compared to the increase in utility costs was mostly due to higher natural gas costs  although electricity expenses also increased 
fabrication and other businesses the steel group s fabrication and other businesses reported a combined adjusted operating profit of million for the year ended august  as compared to a profit of million in we recorded a million gain from the sale of smi owen steel company in march also  prior to its sale  smi owen had an adjusted operating profit of million for the year ended august  excluding these items  fabrication adjusted operating profits decreased by million for the year ended august  as compared to our fabrication plants shipped  tons in  more than the  tons shipped during our fabricated rebar shipments increased  tons as compared to lower structural  joist and post plant shipments partially offset this increase 
the average fabrication selling price for the year ended august  decreased per ton as compared to our rebar fabrication  construction related products  post and heat treating plants were profitable during the year ended august  our joist and structural steel fabri cation operations recorded losses during due to lower selling prices and shipments 
during the year ended august   the joist plants reduced certain inventory stock values by million to their estimated current market value 
also  during the year ended august   we wrote down thousand of inventory at two of our other fabrication facilities  we recognized a thousand gain on the trade in of rental forms in construction related products  and we reduced our deferred insurance proceeds accrual by thousand see note  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
during  we acquired substantially all of the operating assets of the denver  colorado location of symons corporation  el wills in fresno  california and dunn del re steel in chandler  arizona 
the symons location is a concrete formwork supplier  and el wills and dunn del re steel are rebar fabrication operations 
the purchase prices for these businesses totaled million 
no single one of these acquisitions was significant to our operations 
copper tube our copper tube division reported an adjusted operating profit of thousand for the year ended august  as compared to an adjusted operating profit of million in net sales were lower in as compared to our copper tube shipments increased to million pounds during as compared to however  our average net selling price for plumbing and refrigeration tube decreased by cents per pound to per pound as compared to per pound in we increased our production to million pounds for the year ended august   which was more than the million pounds that we produced in our average copper scrap price increased cents per pound during the year ended august  as compared to the difference between the sales price and in and  respectively and copper scrap purchase cost and in and  respectively are commonly referred to as the metal spread 
the metal spread declined in as compared to although single family residential construction held up relatively well  other market sectors were weaker which put pressure on selling prices 
recycling our recycling segment reported an adjusted operating profit of million for the year ended august  as compared to an adjusted operating profit of million in all four of the geographic regions where the segment operates were substantially more profitable 
net sales for the year ended august  were million  an increase of as compared to our net sales of million in our gross margins were higher in as compared to  partially due to controls over costs 
the segment processed and shipped  tons of ferrous scrap during the year ended august   an increase of as compared to ferrous sales prices were on average per ton  higher than in greater demand from overseas markets contributed to this increase  as well as the weaker us dollar 
nonferrous markets improved moderately during the year ended august  our average nonferrous scrap sales price of  per ton was higher than in  although shipments were lower at  tons 
the total volume of scrap processed  including the steel group s processing plants  was  tons  an increase of from the  tons processed in marketing and distribution net sales for the year ended august  for our marketing and distribution segment increased million to billion  as compared to net sales of million 
most of the increase related to sales outside of the united states 
adjusted operating profit for the year ended august  was million  an increase of as compared to  due mostly to better results from our international operations 
international steel prices for flat rolled products rose and then weakened  because of decreased demand from china  during the first three quarters of however  the prices for flat rolled steel products rose again during the fourth quarter 
prices for long products slowly increased during our steel shipments increased  except for imports into the us our business in the us was reduced because of the weak economy and the weaker us dollar 
due to these factors  volumes  prices and margins for nonferrous semi finished products were lower in as compared to however  sales and margins for ores  minerals  ferroalloys and special metals were generally higher 
also  freight costs increased in as compared to our marketing and distribution and service center operations in australia were more profitable in as compared to our joint venture europickling facility in belgium became profitable during also  the joint venture arrangements with our investee  trinecke zelezarny  a czech mill  contributed to our sales in central europe 
sales into asia  including china  were strong  especially during the first and second quarters of our fiscal in july  our international subsidiary entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a controlling interest in huta zawiercie  a polish steel minimill 
this acquisition is expected to close by december  other our employees retirement plan expenses were lower for the year ended august  as compared to discretionary items such as contributions were lower for the year ended august  as compared to we committed less to these items because was less profitable 
interest expense for the year ended august  was lower as compared to due primarily to lower overall interest rates on short term borrowings and two interest rate swaps on parts of our long term debt which resulted in lower effective interest rates 
during  we favorably resolved all issues for our federal income tax returns through due to the lack of any material adjustments  we reevaluated the tax accruals and  consequently  reduced the net tax expense by million during on august   we increased our commercial paper program to permit maximum borrowings of up to million  up from the prior year million level 
commercial paper capacity is reduced by any outstanding standby letters of credit under the program which totalled million at august  near term outlook we expect our fiscal year ending august  to be significantly more profitable than  partially because of the internal cost reductions and productivity improvements that we have made 
we also are expecting better economic conditions in  mostly in global manufacturing 
we believe that our first quarter of will have comparable profits to the quarter ended august  we anticipate net earnings excluding the effect of revaluing inventories on the lifo method to be approximately million to million for the first quarter of fiscal we have noted signs of increasing demand in the us manufacturing sector  and some improvement in construction 
however  office  lodging and industrial construction will be slower to recover 
also  orders for capital goods are higher 
asian markets are relatively strong and european markets are partially recovering 
we anticipate that our overall results will be better in the second half of as compared to the first half 
we anticipate our profits will be higher in in our manufacturing segment as compared to because of higher metal spreads and increased production  shipments and prices 
we have implemented several steel minimill price increases on most of our products 
the cumulative price increases are per ton for merchant bar and per ton for reinforcing bar 
we are expecting these price increases to become fully effective during the first half of fiscal as a result  gross margins at our steel minimills should increase 
we expect the gross margins in our fabrication and other related businesses to continue at current levels during the first few months in fiscal however  these margins should improve later in that year 
we anticipate that our recycling segment will continue to report significant profits  due to strong demand for steel scrap and nonferrous metal scrap and the relatively weak us dollar 
our marketing and distribution segment should remain profitable during our fiscal we expect that our us operations will be more profitable  but that our international subsidiary will have lower profits in as compared to overall  prices and volumes should remain constant 
we are expecting that our purchase of the controlling interest in huta zawiercie will be completed by december  we anticipate that our capital spending for will be million  excluding the million acquisition cost for of the shares of huta zawiercie 
most of these expenditures will be in our manufacturing segment including a major improvement project at our smi texas melt shop 
long term outlook we believe we are well positioned to exploit long term opportunities 
long term  we expect stronger demand for our products due to the increased possibility of a recovery in demand throughout the major global economies as well as continued growth in developing countries 
emerging countries often have a higher growth rate for steel and nonferrous metals consumption 
we believe that the demand will increase in asia  particularly in china  as well as in central and eastern europe 
further consolidation is a virtual certainty in the industries in which we participate  and we plan to continue to participate in a prudent way 
the reasons for further consolidation include an inadequate return on capital for most companies  numerous bankruptcies  a high degree of fragmentation  the need to eliminate non competitive capacity and more effective marketing 
compared to segments manufacturing we include our steel group and our copper tube division in our manufacturing segment 
adjusted operating profit is equal to earnings before income taxes for our four steel minimills  our copper tube mill and the steel group s fabrication operations 
our manufacturing adjusted operating profit in increased million as compared to on marginally more million net sales 
we achieved this increase in adjusted operating profit for two primary reasons in i the nonrecurrence of the prior year litigation accrual in the amount of million  and ii the current year gain on the sale of the steel group s heavy structural fabrication operation  smi owen  in the amount of million 
excluding those items  our manufacturing segment s adjusted operating profit was slightly higher than last year 
increased production and shipments at our steel group s minimills more than offset lower selling prices  increased scrap purchase costs and lower copper tube earnings 
also  we spent less in on utilities  and we recorded lower depreciation and amortization expense 
however  fiscal adjusted operating profits decreased from fiscal in the steel group s downstream steel fabrication and related businesses due to lower profits in rebar fabrication and structural steel fabrication  excluding smi owen 
the table below reflects steel and scrap prices per ton august  dollars per ton average mill selling price total sales average mill selling price finished goods only average fabrication selling price average ferrous scrap purchase price minimills during  adjusted operating profit for our four steel minimills rose compared with  despite lower selling prices 
smi south carolina had a million adjusted operating profit in compared to a million loss in smi alabama turned around as well with a million adjusted operating profit in compared to a million loss in adjusted operating profits at smi arkansas were up in the current year period 
these improvements more than offset a decline in adjusted operating profits at smi texas as compared to a major reason for the minimills improved profitability was a increase in shipments because of continued public projects infrastructure construction 
shipments were  tons in compared to  in mill production also increased over last year 
tons rolled were up to  in tons melted were up to  in even though demand was strong  the average total mill selling price at per ton was below last year 
also  in  we sold more semi finished billets  a product with a lower selling price than our average 
average scrap purchase costs were per ton higher than in  resulting in smaller margins 
utility expenses declined by million as compared to decreases in natural gas costs more than offset higher electricity costs 
also  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by million in  primarily because smi south carolina fully depreciated its mill rolls and guides as well as certain melt shop equipment 
the mills also received million from a nonrecurring graphite electrode litigation settlement in the us government s new tariffs cover most of the steel minimills products and range from the first year  declining over the next two years 
an import licensing and monitoring system and an anti surge mechanism will further strengthen these remedies 
also  the us administration plans to continue discussions with other steel producing nations to remove excess global capacity and eliminate subsidies 
fabrication and other businesses adjusted operating profit in the steel group s fabrication and other businesses increased by million in as compared to excluding the gain on the sale of smi owen million and the litigation accrual million  adjusted operating profits in decreased by million as compared to near the end of fiscal  we discovered two significant  but unrelated events  requiring retroactive writedowns at two rebar fabrication operations 
the total amount of the adjustments required to correct the august  balance sheets of these two facilities was million 
these adjustments affected fiscal years from to in august  we uncovered a theft and an accounting fraud which occurred over four years at a rebar fabrication plant in south carolina 
the total adjustment required to revert the accounting records to their proper balances was million 
in september  we discovered accounting errors related to losses on rebar fabrication and placement jobs at one facility in california  some of which date back to its acquisition in fiscal the resulting charge was million 
the south carolina incident resulted in a thousand expense in fiscal the remaining million for both instances was attributed thousand to fiscal  million to fiscal  and thousand to  resulting in prior period adjustments to these previously reported financial statements 
we took immediate action to strengthen compliance with our internal control policies in the areas of segregation of duties  personnel and management review and oversight 
controllers at both locations were replaced as well as the general manager of the rebar fabrication plant in south carolina 
the steel group has increased the level of detail  the frequency of submission and the amount of review of its operating locations reporting 
the company has renewed emphasis on periodic and timely internal balance sheet audits at all operating locations and completed audits of all its operating locations in fiscal no major areas of noncompliance were noted 
senior management and area managers of all the company s locations attended internal meetings led by the ceo and cfo regarding management s responsibility for internal control  dealing with noncompliance issues and the company s commitment to only the highest of ethical standards of conduct 
fabrication plant shipments totaled  tons  down fractionally from  tons shipped in the average fabrication selling price in decreased per ton as compared to rebar fabrication markets were softer in as a result of intense competition  and several plants reported losses 
during  we acquired the real estate  equipment  inventory and work in process of varmicon  inc in harlingen  texas 
we now operate this rebar fabrication facility under the name of smi valley steel 
the steel joist operations  which includes cellular and castellated beams  were break even in  an improvement over the loss in both prices and shipments decreased  but lower operating costs and shop efficiencies helped significantly 
also  in these operations incurred million in start up costs 
structural steel fabrication profits  excluding smi owen and the prior year litigation accrual  were down in compared to however  our concrete related products operations were more profitable in we continued to expand this business through the acquisition of dowel assembly manufacturing company  or damco  in jackson  mississippi 
damco manufactures dowel baskets and has an epoxy coating business 
in  the steel group started spray forming international  a stainless steel cladding operation located in south carolina 
copper tube our copper tube division s adjusted operating profit decreased with less net sales as compared to copper tube shipments increased from to a record million pounds  and production increased from to a record million pounds 
however  average sales prices dropped in to per pound as compared to the average sales price in of 
the biggest factor was lower apartment and hotel motel construction 
consequently  demand for plumbing and refrigeration tube was not as strong 
the product mix included increased quantities of hvac products and line sets 
in the marketplace  we continued to adapt to the consolidation among our buyers 
the difference between sales price and copper scrap purchase cost commonly referred to as the metal spread  declined in compared to lower raw material purchase costs did not fully compensate for the decline in selling prices 
recycling our recycling segment reported an adjusted operating profit of million in compared with an adjusted operating loss of million in net sales in were lower at million as compared to however  gross margins were above last year  primarily because we shipped more total tons 
demand for ferrous scrap improved both in the us and internationally 
the segment processed and shipped  tons of ferrous scrap in  more than in ferrous sales prices were on average per ton  an increase of from nonferrous shipments were flat at  tons 
the average nonferrous scrap sales price of per ton was lower than in increased productivity  higher asset turnover and reduced costs contributed to the improved results 
the total volume of scrap processed  including the steel group s processing plants  was  tons  an increase of from the  tons processed in in  we acquired most of the transportation assets of sampson steel corporation in beaumont  texas 
these assets were combined with our existing scrap processing facility in beaumont 
also  we closed our midland  texas facility  resulting in a writedown of  on certain equipment 
marketing and distribution net sales in for our marketing and distribution segment increased to million as compared to adjusted operating profit in increased to million as compared to  mostly due to better results from our australian operations 
international steel prices and volumes for steel and nonferrous semifinished products improved during the second half of  primarily in the distribution and processing businesses 
however  depressed economies  oversupply in most markets and intense competition from domestic suppliers in the respective markets caused compressed margins for numerous steel products  nonferrous metal products and industrial raw materials and products 
the us dollar weakened against major currencies  a beneficial development 
in september  we completed our acquisition of coil steels group  an australian service center in which we already owned a share 
this acquisition provided million of additional profits and million in net sales during sales and profits for the company s pre existing business in australia also improved significantly 
however  this increase in net sales was more than offset by decreased sales in our us operations due to fewer imports into the united states 
operating profits for the us divisions improved significantly due to cometals which returned to more historical levels  and dallas trading which benefited from the us tariff legislation 
lower margins at commonwealth on semi finished products almost offset these improvements 
our european operations net sales decreased slightly in as compared to  but profits improved significantly 
the segment s recent strategy of growing its downstream marketing and distribution business offset the continuing very difficult trading conditions 
other selling  general and administrative  as well as employees retirement plans expenses  were higher in as compare to  mostly due to our acquisition of csg in and discretionary items such as bonuses and profit sharing 
this increase was consistent with the improvement in our operating profitability 
interest expense decreased by million from largely due to lower interest rates and much lower average short term borrowings 
also  during we entered into two interest rate swaps which resulted in interest expense sav ings 
during  we favorably resolved all issues for our federal income tax returns through due to the lack of any material adjustments  we reevaluated the tax accruals and  consequently  reduced the net tax expense by million during liquidity and capital resources we discuss liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis 
our discussion includes the sources and uses of our three operating segments and centralized corporate functions 
we have a centralized treasury function and use inter company loans to efficiently manage the short term cash needs of our operating divisions 
we invest any excess funds centrally 
we rely upon cash flows from operating activities  and to the extent necessary  external short term financing sources 
our short term financing sources include commercial paper  sales of certain accounts receivable  short term trade financing arrangements and borrowing under our bank credit facilities 
from time to time  we have issued long term public and private debt placements 
our investment grade credit ratings and general business conditions affect our access to external financing on a cost effective basis 
depending on the price of our common stock  we may realize significant cash flows from the exercise of stock options 
moody s investors service p  standard poor s corporation a and fitch f rate our commercial paper program in the second highest category 
to support our commercial paper program  on august   we entered into a million unsecured  contractually committed revolving credit agreement with a group of sixteen banks 
our million facility expires in august this agreement provides for borrowing in us dollars with the interest rate indexed to libor 
the spread over libor may vary between basis points and basis points based upon the rating of our non credit enhanced senior unsecured long term debt by moody s investors service and standard poor s corporation 
actual borrowings are subject to a facility fee which may vary between and basis points based on the same debt ratings 
in addition  if we borrow more than of the authorized borrowings under the credit agreement  we will incur an additional basis point fee on actual borrowings 
no compensating balances are required 
the credit agreement serves as a backup to our commercial paper program 
we plan to continue our commercial paper program and the revolving credit agreements in comparable amounts to support the commercial paper program 
for added flexibility  we may secure financing through securitized sales of certain accounts receivable in an amount not to exceed million and direct sales of accounts receivable 
we may continually sell accounts receivable on an ongoing basis to replace those receivables that have been collected from our customers 
our long term public debt was million at august  and is investment grade rated by standard poor s corporation bbb  fitch bbb and by moody s investors service baa 
we have access to the public markets for potential refinancing or the issuance of additional long term debt 
see note  subsequent events  to our consolidated financial statements regarding our issuance of bonds and repayment of certain debt after year end 
also  we have numerous informal  uncommitted credit facilities available from domestic and international banks 
these credit facilities are priced at current market rates 
credit ratings affect our ability to obtain short and long term financing and the cost of such financing 
if the rating agencies were to reduce our credit ratings  we would pay higher financing costs and probably would have less availability of the informal  uncommitted facilities 
on november   moody s investors service downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating from baa to baa  but changed its outlook from negative to stable  equal to that of standard poor s 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors 
these factors include earnings  fixed charges such as interest  cash flows  total debt outstanding  off balance sheet obligations and other commitments  total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors 
the rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows  business strategy  industry conditions and contingencies 
we are committed to maintaining our investment grade ratings 
certain of our financing agreements include various covenants 
the most restrictive of these covenants requires us to maintain an interest coverage ratio of greater than three times and a debt to capitalization ratio of  as defined in the financing agreement 
a few of the agreements provide that if we default on the terms of another financing agreement  it is considered a default under these agreements 
we have complied with the requirements  including the covenants of our financing agreements  as of and for the year ended august  our revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable securitization agreement include ratings triggers 
the trigger in the revolving credit agreements is solely a means to reset pricing for facility fees and  if a borrowing occurs  on loans 
within the accounts receivable securitization agreement  the ratings trigger is contained in a termination event  but the trigger is set at catastrophic levels 
the trigger requires a combination of ratings actions on behalf of two independent rating agencies and is set at levels six ratings categories below our current rating 
our manufacturing and recycling businesses are capital intensive 
our capital requirements include construction  purchases of equipment and maintenance capital at existing facilities 
we plan to invest in new operations 
we also plan to invest in working capital to support the growth of our businesses and pay dividends to our stockholders 
we continue to assess alternative means of raising capital  including potential dispositions of under performing or non strategic assets 
any potential future major acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources including the issuance of common or preferred stock 
cash flows our cash flows from operating activities primarily result from sales of steel and related products  and to a lesser extent  sales of nonferrous metal products 
we also sell and rent construction related products and accessories 
we have a diverse and generally stable customer base 
we use futures or forward contracts as needed to mitigate the risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and metals commodity prices 
the volume and pricing of orders from our us customers in the manufacturing and construction sectors affect our cash flows from operating activities 
our international marketing and distribution operations also significantly affect our cash flows from operating activities 
the weather can influence the volume of products we ship in any given period 
also  the general economy  the strength of the us dollar  governmental action  and various other factors beyond our control influence our volume and prices 
periodic fluctuations in our prices and volumes can result in variations in cash flows from operating activities 
despite these fluctuations  we have historically relied on operating activities as a steady source of cash 
our net cash flows from operating activities were million for the year ended august   which were million lower as compared to the million of net cash flows from our operating activities for the year ended august  our net earnings decreased million in as compared to also  our accounts receivable and inventories increased by million in as compared to an increase of million in these items increased in primarily in our marketing and distribution operations due to higher sales orders from outside of the united states 
our accounts payable at august  was higher than at august   but the increase in accounts payable was not commensurate with the increase in inventories 
during the year ended august   we paid more bonuses and other discretionary expenses  which had been accrued at august   than we did during the year ended august  as a result  our accrued expenses decreased during the year ended august  also  we paid million during the year ended august  relating to an adverse trial judgment that was upheld on appeal 
this judgment had been accrued at august  during  we had received million from a favorable litigation settlement and million for the contract balance and settlement of disputed change orders on an old large structural steel fabrication contract at smi owen 
we invested million in property  plant and equipment during the year ended august   an increase of million as compared to the capital expenditures in were primarily in our manufacturing segment 
in addition  we acquired the operating assets of two rebar fabrication operations and one construction related products business in  for a total of million cash 
in  we acquired the remaining shares of the coil steels group csg for million 
also  in  we received million from the sale of the assets of smi owen  our large structural steel fabrication operation located in columbia  south carolina 
we assess our capital spending each quarter and reevaluate our requirements based upon current and expected results 
at august    common shares were issued and outstanding  including  held in our treasury 
we paid dividends of million during the year ended august   as compared to million in during the year ended august   we purchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share 
these shares were held in our treasury 
during  we received million from the issuance of stock from our treasury under our stock incentive and purchase plans  as compared to million received from these transactions in during the year ended august   we used our excess cash and cash equivalents  sold accounts receivable and entered into short term trade financing arrangements to help meet our operating cash requirements  purchase property  plant and equipment and acquire our common stock for the treasury 
no amounts were outstanding under our commercial paper program at august  or we have no significant amounts due on our long term debt until july we believe that we have sufficient liquidity for fiscal contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations as of august  dollars in thousands payments due within total year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt     operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations      total contractual cash obligations      we have not discounted the cash obligations in this table 
total amounts are included in the august  consolidated balance sheet 
see note  credit arrangements  and note  subsequent event  to the consolidated financial statements 
includes minimum lease payment obligations for noncancelable equipment and real estate leases in effect as of august  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
about of these purchase obligations are for inventory items to be sold in the ordinary course of business  most of the remainder are for freight and supplies associated with normal revenue producing activities 
other commercial commitments we maintain stand by letters of credit to provide support for certain transactions that our customers or suppliers request 
at august   we had committed million under these arrangements 
all commitments expire within one year 
at the request of a customer and its surety bond issuer  we have agreed to indemnify the surety against all costs the surety may incur should our customer fail to perform its obligations under construction contracts covered by payment and performance bonds issued by the surety 
we are the customer s primary supplier of steel  and steel is a substantial portion of our customer s cost to perform the contracts 
we believe we have adequate controls to monitor the customer s performance under the contracts including payment for the steel we supply 
as of august   the surety had issued bonds in the total amount without reduction for work performed to that date of million which are subject to our guaranty obligation under the indemnity agreement 
contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings  government investigations including environmental matters  and contract disputes 
we may incur settlements  fines  penalties or judgments because of some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals we deem necessary 
the amounts we accrue could vary substantially from amounts we pay due to several factors including the following evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions  the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process  and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
accordingly  we cannot always estimate a meaningful range of possible exposure 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our financial statements for the estimable potential impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not significantly affect the long term results of operations or our financial position 
however  they may have a material impact on earnings for a particular period 
construction contract disputes see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental and other matters general we are subject to federal  state and local pollution control laws and regulations 
we anticipate that compliance with these laws and regulations will involve continuing capital expenditures and operating costs 
our original business and one of our core businesses for over eight decades is metals recycling 
in the present era of conservation of natural resources and ecological concerns  we are committed to sound ecological and business conduct 
certain governmental regulations regarding environmental concerns  however well intentioned  are contrary to the goal of greater recycling 
such regulations expose us and the industry to potentially significant risks 
we believe that recycled materials are commodities that are diverted by recyclers  such as us  from the solid waste streams because of their inherent value 
commodities are materials that are purchased and sold in public and private markets and commodities exchanges every day around the world 
they are identified  purchased  sorted  processed and sold in accordance with carefully established industry specifications 
environmental agencies at various federal and state levels classify certain recycled materials as hazardous substances and subject recyclers to material remediation costs  fines and penalties 
taken to extremes  such actions could cripple the recycling industry and undermine any national goal of material conservation 
enforcement  interpretation  and litigation involving these regulations are not well developed 
solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease  and in the past owned or leased  properties that have been used in our operations 
although we used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties or on or under locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of several such properties 
state and federal laws applicable to wastes and contaminated properties have gradually become stricter over time 
under new laws  we could be required to remediate properties impacted by previously disposed wastes 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party at a number of contaminated sites 
we generate wastes  including hazardous wastes  that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state and or local statutes where we operate 
these statutes  regulations and laws may have limited disposal options for certain wastes 
superfund the us environmental protection agency  or epa  or an equivalent state agency notified us that we are considered a potentially responsible party  or prp  at fourteen sites  none owned by us 
we may be obligated under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  or cercla  or a similar state statute to conduct remedial investigation  feasibility studies  remediation and or removal of alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the epa for such activities 
we are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting  or at the appropriate time we may contest  our liability at the sites 
in addition  we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the epa as potential cercla sites 
clean water act the clean water act cwa imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes into waters of the united states  a term broadly defined 
these controls have become more stringent over time and it is probable that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future 
permits must generally be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters  comparable permits may be required at the state level 
the cwa and many state agencies provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants 
in addition  the epa has promulgated regulations that may require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff 
in the event of an unauthorized discharge  we may be liable for penalties and costs 
clean air act our operations are subject to regulations at the federal  state and local level for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution 
new and modified sources of air pollutants are often required to obtain permits prior to commencing construction  modification and or operations 
major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent requirements  including the potential need for additional permits and to increased scrutiny in the context of enforcement 
the epa has been implementing its stationary emission control program through expanded enforcement of the new source review program 
under this program  new or modified sources are required to construct what is referred to as the best available control technology 
additionally  the epa is implementing new  more stringent standards for ozone and fine particulate matter 
the epa recently has promulgated new national emission stands for hazardous air pollutants for steel mills which will require all major sources in this category to meet the standards by reflecting application of maximum achievable control technology 
compliance with the new standards could require additional expenditures 
in fiscal  we incurred environmental expense of million 
this expense included the cost of environmental personnel at various divisions  permit and license fees  accruals and payments for studies  tests  assessments  remediation  consultant fees  baghouse dust removal and various other expenses 
approximately million of our capital expenditures for related to costs directly associated with environmental compliance 
at august   million was accrued for environmental liabilities of which million is classified as other long term liabilities 
dividends we have paid quarterly cash dividends in each of the past consecutive years 
we paid dividends in at the rate of cents per share each quarter

also  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
the following types of derivative instruments were outstanding at august   in accordance with our risk management program 
currency exchange forwards we enter into currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of international trade commitments denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  or  if the transaction involves our australian or european subsidiaries  their local currency 
no single foreign currency poses a primary risk to us 
fluctuations that cause temporary disruptions in one market segment tend to open opportunities in other segments 
effective september   we changed most of our european subsidiaries functional currency to the euro 
we do not anticipate that this change will have a significant impact on our financial results 
commodity prices we base pricing in some of our sales and purchase contracts on forward metal commodity exchange quotes which we determine at the beginning of the contract 
due to the volatility of the metal commodity indexes  we enter into metal commodity forward or futures contracts for copper  aluminum and zinc 
these forwards or futures mitigate the risk of unanticipated declines in gross margins on these contractual commitments 
physical transaction quantities will not match exactly with standard commodity lot sizes  leading to small gains and losses from ineffectiveness 
interest rate swaps see note  credit arrangements  regarding our strategy for managing the fluctuations in interest rates on our long term debt
