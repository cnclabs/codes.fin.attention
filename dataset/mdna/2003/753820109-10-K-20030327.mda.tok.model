inflationary increases in the cost of labor  food and other operating costs could adversely affect the company s restaurant operating margins

although the company has been able to and will continue to attempt to pass along increases in the minimum wage and in other costs through food and beverage price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increases can be reflected in its prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without diminishing  to some degree  customer spending at its restaurants 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the company adopted sfas effective as of the beginning of fiscal year sfas requires that an intangible asset that is acquired shall be initially recognized and measured based on its fair value 
this statement also provides that goodwill should not be amortized  but shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company ceased amortization of goodwill and performed the required goodwill impairment testing 
the impairment test required the company to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value to determine whether there is an indication that an impairment may exist 
if an impairment of goodwill is determined to exist  it is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its fair value 
upon performing the initial test of the carrying value of the company s goodwill  it was concluded that there was no current indication of impairment to goodwill 
accordingly  no impairment losses were recorded upon the initial adoption of sfas as of the date of adoption  the company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of approximately million

discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model or changes in the company s capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value  over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or software or closing of facilities could also result in shortened useful lives 
the company s accounting policies regarding property and equipment include judgments by management regarding the estimated useful lives of these assets  the residual values to which the assets are depreciated  and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact the company s need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including restaurant sites  fixed assets  intangibles and goodwill are reviewed by the company for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
expected cash flows associated with an asset is a key factor in determining the recoverability of the asset 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
the company s estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  the company recognizes an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
judgments made by the company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the company s ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of long lived assets are assessed  these factors could cause the company to realize a material impairment charge 
in  the company recognized a  charge for the writedown of one longhorn steakhouse restaurant and in recognized a  charge for the writedown of five longhorn steakhouse restaurants based on an evaluation of expected cash flows 
self insurance reserves the company self insures for a significant portion of expected losses under its workers compensation  employee medical and general liability programs 
accrued liabilities have been recorded based on estimates of the ultimate costs to settle incurred and incurred but not reported claims 
the accounting policies regarding self insurance programs include certain management judgments and assumptions regarding the frequency or severity of claims and claim development patterns  and claim reserve  management  and settlement practices 
unanticipated changes in these factors may produce materially different amounts of expense that would be reported under these programs 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for by the company in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company reviews and assesses the recoverability of any deferred tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provides any necessary allowances as required 
an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
item a

to achieve the company s objective of managing its exposure to interest rate changes  the company may from time to time use interest rate swaps
