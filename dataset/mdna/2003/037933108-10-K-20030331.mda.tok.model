item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations apria operates in the home healthcare segment of the healthcare industry and provides services in the home respiratory therapy  home infusion therapy and home medical equipment areas 
in all three lines  apria provides patients with a variety of clinical services and related products and supplies  most of which are prescribed by a physician as part of a care plan 
apria provides these services to patients in the home throughout the united states through approximately branch locations 
strategy 
apria is pursuing an operating strategy to increase market share and improve profitability 
key elements of the strategy are as follows focus on growth in its core businesses of home respiratory therapy  home infusion therapy and home medical equipment 
by offering a broad range of services apria achieves a competitive advantage with its managed care  hospital and certain physician customers  enabling it to maintain a diversified revenue base 
in particular  apria continues its emphasis on growth in the home respiratory therapy line  which historically has produced higher gross margins than its home infusion therapy and home medical equipment service lines 
supplement internal growth with strategic acquisitions 
apria operates in a highly fragmented market  which provides an attractive opportunity to drive growth through acquisition of complementary businesses 
develop and apply best practices and productivity improvement programs throughout the company with the aim of achieving greater standardization and enhanced productivity 
success with such programs results in reduced costs and increased margins and cash flows 
apria has developed and implemented standardized clinical and delivery models  billing and collection practices and common operating procedures in its field locations and has centralized purchasing for inventory  patient service equipment and supplies 
apria continues to focus resources on identifying opportunities for further productivity improvements 
critical accounting policies 
apria s management considers the accounting policies that govern revenue recognition and the determination of the net realizable value of accounts receivable to be the most critical in relation to the company s consolidated financial statements 
these policies require management s most complex and subjective judgments 
additionally  the accounting policies related to goodwill and long lived assets require significant judgment 
revenue and accounts receivable 
revenues are recognized on the date services and related products are provided to patients and are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  including private insurers  prepaid health plans  medicare and medicaid 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which apria operates  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts which provides for those accounts from which payment is not expected to be received  although services were provided and revenue was earned 
management performs various analyses to evaluate accounts receivable balances to ensure that recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value 
management applies specified percentages to the accounts receivable aging to estimate the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible and therefore should be reserved 
the percentages are increased as the accounts age  accounts aged in excess of days are reserved at 
management establishes and monitors these percentages through analyses of historical realization data  accounts receivable aging trends  other operating trends  the extent of contracted business and business combinations 
also considered are relevant business conditions such as governmental and managed care payor claims processing procedures and system changes 
if indicated by such analyses  management may periodically adjust the uncollectible estimate and corresponding percentages 
further  focused reviews of certain large and or problematic payors are performed to determine if additional reserves are required 
because of the reimbursement environment in which apria operates and the level of subjectivity that is required in recording revenues and accounts receivable  it is possible that management s estimates could change in the near term  which could have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets of the acquired business 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment 
also  management reviews for impairment of its intangible assets and long lived assets on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
based on its tests and reviews  management does not believe any impairment of its goodwill  intangible assets or other long lived assets existed at december  however  future events or changes in current circumstances could affect the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and long lived assets 
should an asset be deemed impaired  an impairment loss would be recognized  to the extent the carrying value of the asset exceeded its estimated fair market value 
such an impairment charge could have an adverse impact on apria s consolidated financial statements 
segment reporting 
apria s branch locations are organized into geographic regions 
each region consists of a number of branches and a regional office which provides key support services such as billing  purchasing  equipment maintenance  repair and warehousing 
management evaluates operating results on a geographic basis and  therefore  views each region as an operating segment 
all regions provide the same products and services  including respiratory therapy  infusion therapy and home medical equipment and supplies 
for financial reporting purposes  all the company s operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment in accordance with the aggregation criteria of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
change in accounting principles 
effective january   apria adopted sfas no 
which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
the statement provides that goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  but shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate the possibility of impairment 
see amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
effective january   apria adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement superseded sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and amended other guidance related to the accounting and reporting of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
discontinued operations are to be measured similarly to other long lived assets classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
future operating losses will no longer be recognized before they occur 
sfas no 
also broadened the presentation of discontinued operations to include a component of an entity when operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished  and established criteria to determine when a long lived asset is held for sale 
adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on apria s consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statement nos 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
updates and clarifies existing accounting pronouncements related to gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt and requires that certain lease modifications be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
apria adopted the provisions of sfas no 
for its fiscal year beginning january  adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  was issued 
this statement addresses the financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that a liability for such costs be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should be measured and recorded at fair value 
apria will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after december   as required 
in december  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 was issued 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition and guidance for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company has complied with the expanded financial statement disclosure requirements in its consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others  an interpretation of sfas nos 
 and and rescission of fin no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
elaborates on the disclosure requirements for the interim and annual financial statements of the guarantor 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize a liability at the inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
apria was required to adopt the recognition provisions of fin no 
beginning january   while the disclosure provisions became effective at december  adoption of this interpretation will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 was issued 
fin no 
requires that a company consolidate variable interest entities if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entity s activities or the company receives a majority of the entity s residual returns 
fin no 
also requires certain disclosures about variable interest entities in which a company has a significant interest  regardless of whether consolidation is required 
apria will begin to adopt the consolidation provisions of fin no 
beginning january   while certain disclosure requirements will become effective for all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entities were established 
the company currently has no variable interest entities  therefore the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net revenues 
approximately of apria s revenues are reimbursed under arrangements with medicare and medicaid 
in  no other third party payor represented or more of the company s revenues 
the majority of the company s revenues are derived from fees charged for patient care under fee for service arrangements 
revenues derived from capitation arrangements represented less than of total net revenues for because of continuing changes in the healthcare industry and third party reimbursement  there can be no assurance that apria s current revenue levels can be maintained  which could have an impact on operations and cash flows 
net revenues increased to  million in from  million in and  million in growth rates were and in and  respectively 
the increases in both years are due to volume increases  new contracts with regional and national payors  the acquisition of complementary businesses and price increases in certain managed care agreements 
apria s acquisition strategy provides for the rapid integration of acquired businesses into existing operating locations 
this limits management s ability to separately track the amount of revenue generated by an acquired business 
estimating the revenue contribution from acquisitions therefore requires certain assumptions 
based on its analyses  apria management estimates that approximately one third of the revenue growth in was derived from acquisitions 
the following table sets forth a summary of net revenues by service line year ended december  in thousands home respiratory therapy    home infusion therapy    home medical equipment other    total net revenues    home respiratory therapy 
respiratory therapy revenues are derived primarily from the provision of oxygen systems  home ventilators  sleep apnea equipment  nebulizers  respiratory medications and related services 
the respiratory therapy service line increased in by when compared to and increased by in when compared to apria s strategy to target acquisitions of respiratory therapy businesses contributed to the growth in both years 
home infusion therapy 
the infusion therapy service line involves the administration of a drug or nutrient directly into the body intravenously through a needle or catheter 
examples include parenteral nutrition  anti infectives  pain management  chemotherapy and other medications and related services 
the infusion line also includes enteral nutrition which is the administration of nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract through a feeding tube 
infusion therapy revenues increased in versus and in versus the growth in both years is largely due to volume increases 
much of the increase in was concentrated in the enteral nutrition line reflecting renewed focus from a program that centralized the related intake  clinical oversight and distribution functions at the region level 
home medical equipment other 
home medical equipment other revenues are derived from the provision of patient safety items  ambulatory and in home equipment 
home medical equipment other revenues increased by in from its level in and in from although the company s strategy is to target acquisitions of respiratory therapy businesses  the growth in the home medical equipment other line also includes the effects of acquisitions completed in late and in medicare and medicaid reimbursement 
the balanced budget act of contained several provisions that have affected apria s medicare reimbursement levels 
subsequent legislation the medicare balanced budget refinement act of and the medicare medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of mitigated some of the effects of the original legislation 
however  there are some pending issues that may further impact medicare reimbursement to apria in the future 
the balanced budget act of granted streamlined authority to the secretary of the us department of health and human services hhs to increase or reduce the reimbursement for home medical equipment  including oxygen  by up to each year under an inherent reasonableness authority 
in december  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms issued an interim final rule that establishes a process by which such adjustments may be made 
the rule applies to all medicare part b services except those paid under a physician fee schedule or a prospective payment system 
further  the balanced budget act of mandated that cms conduct up to five competitive bidding market demonstrations for medicare part b covered items and services 
cms conducted demonstration projects in polk county  florida and san antonio  texas 
these demonstration projects have been completed 
the demonstrations could provide cms and congress with a model for implementing competitive pricing in all medicare programs 
initial reports from government agencies allege cost savings that vary by product line  but the reports do not include costs incurred by the government to administer the program 
if such a competitive bidding system were implemented  it could result in lower reimbursement rates  exclude certain items and services from coverage or impose limits on increases in reimbursement rates 
although not included in the president s budget  the administration may seek authority to implement nationwide competitive bidding for all medicare part b products and services other than physicians services 
there are members of congress who support legislation to create a national competitive bidding system for durable medical equipment 
the homecare industry is currently working with members of congress and the administration to ensure that the negative impact of competitive bidding on patient choice  small businesses  the economy and other aspects are fully understood 
the industry is also working with the same groups to ensure that the total costs for the government to establish an infrastructure to administer such a complicated program as has been proposed are studied and quantified in detail 
it is not clear under what timeframe the government will conduct such analyses  or whether such initiatives will move ahead 
during  the secretary of hhs wrote to the durable medical equipment regional carriers and recommended  but did not mandate  that medicare and medicaid claims processors base their payments for covered outpatient drugs and biologicals on pricing schedules other than the normally calculated average wholesale prices  which historically has been the industry s basis for drug reimbursement 
the suggested alternative pricing methodology was offered in an effort to reduce reimbursement levels for certain drugs to more closely approximate a provider s acquisition cost  but it would not have covered the costs that homecare pharmacies incur to prepare  deliver or administer the drugs to patients 
clinical services  billing  collection and other overhead costs also would not have been considered 
under current government reimbursement schedules  these costs are not clearly defined but are implicitly covered within the reimbursement for the drug 
the healthcare industry has taken issue with hhs s approach for several reasons  primarily because it fails to consider the accompanying costs of delivering and administering these types of drug therapies to patients in their homes 
further  if providers choose to discontinue providing these drugs due to inadequate reimbursement  patient access to homecare may be jeopardized 
the medicare  medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of provided for a moratorium on decreasing the payment rates in effect as of january   for drugs and biologicals under the current medicare payment methodology 
this legislation also required the general accounting office gao to conduct a thorough study  by september  of the adequacy of current payments 
the gao was also directed to recommend revised payment methodologies and report to congress and the secretary of hhs 
the study was completed but the authors acknowledged that the limited scope and deadline associated with the study did not allow for a thorough analysis of the homecare pharmacy aspects of covered services  legitimate service components and related costs do exist  and different methods of determining drug delivery and administration payments may be necessary for different types of drugs 
currently  the timing and impact of such pricing methodology revisions are not known 
there is interest in congress in legislation that would replace average wholesale price as the basis for medicare drug reimbursement  but to date there has been no agreement within congress as to what the alternative should be 
some states have already adopted  or are contemplating adopting  some form of the proposed alternate pricing methodology for certain drugs and biologicals under the medicaid program 
in at least states  these changes have reduced the level of reimbursement received by apria to an unacceptable level without a corresponding offset or increase to compensate for the service costs incurred 
in several of those states  apria has elected to stop accepting new medicaid patient referrals for the affected drugs 
the company is continuing to provide services to patients already on service  and for those who receive other medicaid covered respiratory  home medical equipment or infusion therapies 
as a percentage of total business  medicaid represents a very small percentage of apria s home infusion and home delivered respiratory medication revenues 
gross profit 
gross margins were in and and in gross margins have remained consistent due to negligible reimbursement price increases and consistent pricing for the products apria purchases to serve its patients 
also  the proportion of business among apria s three major service lines has remained fairly steady 
provision for doubtful accounts 
as described in the critical accounting policies section above  accounts receivable estimated to be uncollectible are provided for through the application of specified percentages to each receivables aging category 
for  and  the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenues was  and  respectively 
the increase in the percentage in is largely attributable to the year s acquisition activity 
the time consuming processes of converting the acquired patient files onto apria s systems and obtaining provider numbers from government payors delay billing of the newly acquired business 
during this time  a provision for doubtful accounts is recorded on the earned but unbilled receivables as they pass through the aging categories 
when the billings are finally submitted and  subsequently  cash is received  the provision requirement decreases 
because the majority of the acquired business in was effected in the last half of the year  there was not sufficient time for completion of this cycle on a number of the acquisitions 
see critical accounting policies and accounts receivable 
selling  distribution and administrative 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses incurred in direct support of operations and those associated with administrative functions 
expenses incurred by the operating locations include salaries and other expenses in the following functional areas selling  distribution  clinical  intake  reimbursement  warehousing and repair 
many of these operating costs are directly variable with revenue growth patterns 
some are also very sensitive to market driven price fluctuations such as facility lease and fuel costs 
the administrative expenses include overhead costs incurred by the operating locations and corporate support functions 
these expenses do not vary as closely with revenue growth as do the operating costs 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses  expressed as percentages of net revenues  were in  in and for the decrease in reflects the benefit of various standardization and productivity initiatives that have been implemented 
delivery expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased by nearly 
also  bonus expense was high in as the bonus plans were extended to all employees and the payment provisions of these plans were enriched  thereby resulting in the expense increase 
the plans did not include such provisions 
offsetting the decreases in were million in costs related to the departure of the former chief executive officer and million in professional fees associated with the settlement of prior year tax examinations 
see income tax expense 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was million in amortization of goodwill and intangible assets was million and million in and  respectively 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   goodwill amortization ceased 
amortization of goodwill was million and million in and  respectively 
the effect of adding these amounts back as though the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 
were adopted at the beginning of would have resulted in net income and diluted income per share increases of million and in and million and in the increase in amortization in when compared to was due to the acquisitions that were consummated during and the latter part of see business combinations 
interest expense and income 
interest expense was million in  million in and million in interest income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
analyzed on a net basis  the decrease in when compared to can be attributed to a number of factors 
the dramatic decreases in market driven interest rates that took place over the course of are fully reflected in interest expense in reflects a full year s benefit of the july refinancing that replaced the million senior subordinated notes with debt at significantly more favorable interest rates and lowered the applicable interest margin on the bank loans 
the refinancing also resulted in the write off of debt issuance costs related to the notes and old bank debt that  in turn  lowered the related amortization expense 
in june  apria executed an amendment to the credit agreement that  among other items  lowered the applicable interest margin on the million term loan 
also impacting net interest expense is a million reduction in long term debt during finally  the settlement of prior year tax examinations during resulted in a million interest refund 
the decrease in net interest expense in when compared to also reflects the market driven interest rate decreases and the lower interest rates and amortization resulting from the july refinancing 
also  long term debt decreased by million during see long term debt 
income tax expense 
income taxes for are million and were provided at the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the year as reduced by a benefit of million that resulted from prior year tax examinations that were settled in the fourth quarter 
income taxes for and were million and million  respectively  and were provided at the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the respective year 
at december   apria had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million expiring in varying amounts in the years through  and various state operating loss carryforwards that began to expire in additionally  the company has an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately million 
as a result of settling the prior year tax examinations  apria utilized approximately million of its previously limited million net operating loss carryforward during which reduced its effective tax rate to for the year ended december  such net operating loss carryforward was generated prior to and utilization had been limited to million per year in accordance with internal revenue code section prior to  the million net operating loss carryforward was not recognized for financial statement reporting purposes as management believed it unlikely that they would be used before expiration 
the remaining net operating loss carryforward of approximately million is excluded from the related deferred tax assets and will expire unused 
liquidity and capital resources apria s principal source of liquidity is its operating cash flow  which is supplemented by a million revolving credit facility 
apria s ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of its operating needs has afforded it the ability  among other things  to pursue its acquisition strategy and fund patient service equipment expenditures to support revenue growth  while continuing to reduce long term debt 
apria s management believes that its operating cash flow and revolving credit line will continue to be sufficient to fund its operations and growth strategies 
however  sustaining the current cash flow levels is dependent on many factors  some of which are not within apria s control  such as government reimbursement levels and the financial health of its payors 
cash flow 
cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in and million in the cash flow increase in was primarily attributable to the increase in net income before items not requiring cash 
also contributing to the increase was an income tax refund  including interest  related to the settlement of prior year tax examinations 
the cash flow increase was offset by an increase in accounts receivable and the timing of disbursements processed through accounts payable 
also offsetting the net income increase in was a decrease in accrued expenses 
the cash flow increase in was primarily attributable to the increase in net income before items not requiring cash and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
partially offsetting this was an increase in accounts receivable due to the revenue increases 
cash used in investing activities decreased in when compared to due to reduced levels of patient service equipment expenditures and a decrease in acquisition activity 
cash used in increased from due to an increase in acquisition activity and increases in patient service equipment purchases 
cash used in financing activities increased between and due to the repurchase of apria s common stock in the amount of million  which was partially offset by a decrease in payments against long term debt due to the voluntary prepayments effected in cash used in decreased from primarily due to large voluntary prepayments made against long term debt in the latter part of and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in see long term debt 
contractual cash obligations 
the following table summarizes apria s long term cash payment obligations to which the company is contractually bound for the year ending december  in millions total term loans capitalized lease obligations operating leases deferred acquisition payments total contractual cash obligations 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts increased by million during which is directly attributable to the revenue increase 
accounts aged in excess of days decreased from at december  to at december  days sales outstanding calculated as of each period end by dividing accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  by the day rolling average of net revenues were at december  compared to at december  see critical accounting policies 
unbilled receivables 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables of million and million at december  and  respectively 
delays  ranging from a day up to several weeks  between the date of service and billing can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and external sources 
earned but unbilled receivables are aged from date of service and are considered in apria s analysis of historical performance and collectibility 
the increase in from the end of is largely due to acquisitions effected during the time consuming processes of converting patient files onto apria s systems and obtaining provider numbers from government payors routinely delay billing of the newly acquired business 
inventories and patient service equipment 
inventories consist primarily of pharmaceuticals and disposable products used in conjunction with patient service equipment 
patient service equipment consists of respiratory and home medical equipment that is provided to in home patients for the course of their care plan and subsequently returned to apria for reuse 
the branch locations serve as the primary point from which inventories and patient service equipment are delivered to the patient 
the branches are supplied with inventory and equipment from the regional warehouses  where the purchasing responsibility lies 
the regions are also responsible for repairs and scheduled maintenance of patient service equipment  which adds to the frequent movement of equipment between the region and branch locations 
further  at any given time  approximately of apria s patient service equipment is located in patients homes 
inherent in this asset flow is the fact that losses will occur 
management has successfully instituted a number of controls over the company s inventories and patient service equipment to minimize such losses 
however  there can be no assurance that apria will be able to maintain its current level of control over inventories and patient service equipment 
continued revenue growth is directly dependent on apria s ability to fund its inventory and patient service equipment requirements 
deferred income taxes 
the decrease in deferred tax assets combined current and non current from december  to december  is primarily due to the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   apria had a net non current deferred tax liability of million that resulted primarily from changes in goodwill amortization expense in accordance with sfas no 
and additional tax depreciation expense as a result of a federal statute change 
see income tax expense 
long term debt 
apria has a million senior secured credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by bank of america  na the credit agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility  a million term loan and a million term loan 
effective june  the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date  reduce the applicable interest rate margins and modify the repayment schedule for the million term loan 
the final maturity date for the revolving credit facility is july  the remaining payment schedule on the million term loan requires consecutive quarterly payments ranging from million to million with the final payment of million due on july  the remaining payment schedule on the million term loan requires consecutive quarterly payments of  followed by three consecutive quarterly payments of million with the final payment of million due on july  these remaining payment schedules reflect voluntary prepayments made in december of million and  on the million and million term loans  respectively 
the senior secured credit agreement permits apria to select one of two variable interest rates 
one option is the base rate  which is expressed as the higher of a the federal funds rate plus or b the prime rate 
the other option is the eurodollar rate  which is based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
interest on outstanding balances under the senior secured credit agreement are determined by adding a margin to the eurodollar rate or base rate in effect at each interest calculation date 
the applicable margins for the revolving credit facility and the million term loan are based on apria s leverage ratio  which is the ratio of its funded debt to its last four quarters of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the applicable margin ranges from to for eurodollar loans and from to for base rate loans 
for the million term loan  the margins are fixed at for eurodollar loans and at for base rate loans 
the effective interest rate at december  was on total borrowings of million 
the senior credit agreement also requires payment of commitment fees ranging from to also based on apria s leverage ratio on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of apria 
the credit agreement contains numerous restrictions  including but not limited to  covenants requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios  limitations on additional borrowings  capital expenditures  mergers  acquisitions and investments  and restrictions on cash dividends  loans and other distributions 
the agreement also permits apria to expend a maximum of million per year on acquisitions 
at december   the company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants required by the credit agreement 
on december  outstanding borrowings on the two term loans were million and there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
outstanding letters of credit totaled million and credit available under the revolving facility was million 
hedging activities 
apria is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its underlying variable rate long term debt 
apria s policy for managing interest rate risk is to evaluate and monitor all available relevant information  including but not limited to  the structure of its interest bearing assets and liabilities  historical interest rate trends and interest rate forecasts published by major financial institutions 
the tools apria may utilize to moderate its exposure to fluctuations in the relevant interest rate indices include  but are not limited to strategic determination of repricing periods and related principal amounts  and derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements  caps or collars 
apria does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
at december   apria had six interest rate swap agreements in effect to fix its libor based variable rate debt 
two of the interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million and a fixed rate of terminate on march  in december  apria entered into four additional swap agreements with terms as follows two two year agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million and a fixed rate of  a three year agreement with a notional amount of million and a fixed rate of  and a four year agreement with a notional amount of million and a fixed rate of 
all rates are stated before application of the interest margins described above 
the swap agreements are being accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities 
accordingly  the difference between the interest received and interest paid is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense 
for  apria paid a net settlement amount of  unrealized gains and losses on the fair value of the swap agreements are reflected  net of taxes  in other comprehensive income 
at december   the aggregate fair value of the swap agreements was a deficit of million and  accordingly  is reflected in the accompanying balance sheet in other accrued liabilities 
apria does not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance as its counterparties to the various swap agreements are nationally recognized financial institutions with strong credit ratings 
treasury stock 
during  apria repurchased million shares of its common stock for million in open market transactions 
in  apria repurchased  shares for  all repurchased common shares are being held in treasury 
apria s credit agreement limits common stock repurchases to million in any fiscal year and million in the aggregate over the term of the agreement 
in march  apria announced that it would resume its stock repurchase program  depending on market conditions and other considerations 
purchases may be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions 
through march   apria repurchased  shares for million 
business combinations 
pursuant to one of its primary growth strategies  apria periodically acquires complementary businesses in specific geographic markets 
these transactions are accounted for as purchases and the results of operations of the acquired companies are included in the accompanying statements of operations from the dates of acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer being amortized 
covenants not to compete are being amortized over the life of the respective agreements 
the aggregate consideration for acquisitions that closed during was million 
allocation of this amount includes million to goodwill and million to intangible assets 
during  the aggregate consideration for acquisitions was million 
cash paid for acquisitions  which includes amounts deferred from prior year acquisitions  totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the success of apria s acquisition strategy is directly dependent on apria s ability to maintain and or generate sufficient liquidity to fund such purchases 
federal investigation 
as previously reported  since mid apria has been the subject of an investigation conducted by the us attorney s office in los angeles and the us department of health and human services 
the investigation concerns the documentation supporting apria s billing for services provided to patients whose healthcare costs are paid by medicare and other federal programs 
apria is cooperating with the government and has responded to various document requests and subpoenas 
apria has been informed that the investigation is the result of civil qui tam litigation filed on behalf of the government against apria 
the complaints in the litigation are under seal  however  and the government has not informed apria of either the identities of the plaintiffs  the court or courts where the proceedings are pending  the date or dates instituted or the factual bases alleged to underlie the proceedings 
to date  the us attorney s office has not informed apria of any decision to intervene in the qui tam actions  however  it could reach a decision with respect to intervention at any time 
government representatives and counsel for the plaintiffs in the qui tam actions asserted in july that  by a process of extrapolation from a sample of patient files to all of apria s billings to the federal government during the three and one half year sample period  apria could be liable to the government under the false claims act for more than billion  consisting of extrapolated overpayment liability  treble damages and penalties of up to  for each allegedly false claim derived from the extrapolation 
apria has acknowledged that there may be errors and omissions in supporting documentation affecting a portion of its billings 
however  it considers the assertions and amounts described in the preceding paragraph to be unsupported both legally and factually and believes that most of the alleged documentation errors and omissions should not give rise to any liability  for overpayment refunds or otherwise 
accordingly  apria believes that the claims asserted are unwarranted and that it is in a position to assert numerous meritorious defenses 
apria has been exchanging information and having discussions with government representatives in an attempt to explore whether it will be possible to resolve this matter on a basis that would be considered fair and reasonable by all parties

however  from time to time the company enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require the company to indemnify parties against third party claims 
the contracts primarily relate to i certain asset purchase agreements  under which the company may provide customary indemnification to the seller of the business being acquired  ii certain real estate leases  under which the company may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities  and other claims arising from the company s use of the applicable premises  and iii certain agreements with the company s officers  directors and employees  under which the company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship

generally  amounts under these contracts cannot be reasonably estimated until a specific claim is asserted 
consequently  no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the company s balance sheets for any of the periods presented
