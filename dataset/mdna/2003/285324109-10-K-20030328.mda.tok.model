industry background semiconductor devices are fabricated by repeating a complex series of process steps on a substrate  or wafer  that is usually made of silicon 
these wafers measure from mm to mm  or to inches  in diameter 
wafers are typically sent through a series of to process steps 
a finished wafer consists of many integrated circuits  each referred to as a device or die or chip  the number depending on the area of the circuits and the size of the wafer 
manufacturers have increasingly utilized larger diameter wafers to achieve more cost effective production 
the move to mm  inch  wafers began in the manufacture of semiconductor devices is very capital intensive 
a typical state of the art facility  usually called a wafer fab  will cost more than billion 
the purchase of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and spare parts  the integration of such equipment into production lines  and the training of employees on a particular supplier s equipment require significant expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers 
wafer probing a wafer prober successively positions each die on the wafer so that the electrical contact points  or pads  on the die align under and make contact with probe pins  which are located on a probe card mounted on the wafer prober 
the probe card  which is generally custom made by other suppliers for the specific device being tested  is 
table of contents connected to a test system  also supplied by other suppliers  which performs the required parametric or functional test 
parametric testing is performed during the wafer fabrication process  referred to as in line testing  and at the completion of the wafer fabrication process  referred to as end of line testing  to measure electrical parameters that verify the reliability of the wafer fabrication process 
functional testing is performed after the completion of wafer fabrication to identify devices that do not conform to particular electrical specifications or performance criteria 
this process is typically called wafer sort 
wafers often go through several wafer probing steps during the manufacturing process 
automatic wafer probers are primarily used during this wafer sort process  which occurs after the fabrication steps are completed and before the separation and packaging of each individual device 
wafer probers are also increasingly used during in line parametric testing 
in line testing requires special equipment features such as cleanroom compatibility and low noise electrical measurement capability  as tests are carried out during the fabrication process 
this testing is done to verify the quality of the manufacturing process while wafers are in an unfinished state where corrective action can occur 
a small number of probers are also used for research and development  and quality and process control applications 
we estimate  based upon our experience  that wafer sort applications represent approximately of the market for automatic wafer probers 
the remaining is divided between in line and end of line testing and laboratory applications 
there is a growing trend for semiconductor manufacturers to contract with other companies to perform their wafer sort operations 
these contract test companies  typically called test houses  perform the wafer testing service and often provide assembly and packing services as well 
a semiconductor manufacturer typically purchases wafer probers when outfitting a new wafer fabrication facility or expanding an existing facility 
wafer probers are also purchased to replace equipment in response to major changes in technology such as larger wafer sizes and greater device complexity 
a semiconductor fabrication facility typically requires to probers to meet testing requirements on a timely basis 
a test house may require hundreds of wafer probe systems to support the testing requirements of the companies that contract with them 
post fab wafer inspection wafers typically undergo an optical inspection step before they are sent from the wafer sort operation to final assembly 
this step identifies die with physical defects that may have passed electrical test  but are at risk of failure after the devices have been packaged 
sorting die both optically and electrically improves product reliability while avoiding the cost of packaging marginal die 
optical inspection on the sort floor is also used after wafer probe to determine whether the probe tips caused bond pad damage 
wafer inspection tools automate this process of defect identification  defect classification  and feedback control processes 
the tools can analyze each individual die on each wafer for defects and process excursions  identify the type of defect or pattern anomaly  measure the defect or anomaly  and pass the quantitative results to both upstream and downstream production machines 
the requirement for automated inspection after the wafer manufacturing process is complete  or post fab is growing 
both the cost of manual inspection and the changing technologies of the packaging process are driving the need for more detailed inspection and process control in the post fab environment 
lightweight  portable electronic devices are driving the growth of new flip chip packaging technologies 
unlike conventional packaging which uses fine gold wires to electrically connect the semiconductor chip to its package  flip chips utilize gold or solder bumps that are deposited onto bonding pads on the chip surface 
the chips are then flipped into packages or directly onto printed circuit boards 
flip chips take up much less space than conventional chips  and due to the elimination of the gold wires  flip chip packages generally operate at higher speeds 
the use of flip chip packaging is expected to grow rapidly as memory  soc and other device types are required to operate at high speed and in tight spaces 
wafer bumping is an expensive process  and the cost of flip chip packaging can be very high 
bumps that are deformed  missing  and oversized or undersized will 
table of contents cause the failure of flip chip devices 
to avoid the cost of packaging defective chips  semiconductor manufacturers are turning to automated wafer inspection systems 
automated inspection systems must be able to inspect every bump on every wafer in order for semiconductor manufacturers to control their wafer bumping processes and screen out defective chips prior to probing and packaging 
an emerging application for post fab inspection is the micro electro mechanical systems mems device market 
mems devices are miniaturized electromechanical devices such as switches  accelerometers  pressure sensors and inkjet printheads  which are fabricated using semiconductor manufacturing techniques 
these mems devices need optical inspection to verify the small structures fabricated into the device 
process management software software plays an important role in the ic manufacturing process 
capital and operating costs of a fabrication facility are very high so semiconductor manufacturers are seeking ways to improve overall equipment efficiency oee  optimize yield and provide plant wide integration 
manufacturers are seeking a total integrated software infrastructure to produce  correlate  manage  and analyze data throughout the production process 
in a wafer sort area  network software is increasingly being used to manage wafer information  product specific recipes and equipment information 
yield  or the percentage of good die that can be realized from a wafer  is a critical factor in determining the profitability of a production line  and often the semiconductor manufacturer as a whole 
therefore  efforts to maximize the yield of each product line have become a key engineering priority at these companies 
this has led to a growing need for tools that monitor and analyze defects 
also  as defect problems are brought under control  there is an increased emphasis on operational efficiency 
software tools are used to bring together fab process data  inspection results  electrical test data  and product test data to help determine which process zones or tools contribute most significantly to yield loss and to automate and optimize the operational efficiency of the semiconductor fabrication facility 
the software provides a common location and format for presenting this data and doing cross correlation between data types for the purpose of yield enhancement analysis and process optimization 
software tools also provide computerized interfaces and navigation capabilities for ic design  failure analysis fa  defect review and debugging 
historically  much of the software used in this market is developed in house by the engineering group responsible for yield or through a dedicated software development group 
this results in highly customized solutions that are inflexible and expensive to maintain 
many organizations are now looking to third party providers of both standard and customizable solutions to lower their support costs  maximize their engineers productivity and increase the overall functionality of their analysis tools

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  warranties  allowance for doubtful accounts  and minority equity investments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments or estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on the sale of our semiconductor manufacturing equipment when we have received a customer purchase order or contract  when we have delivered the products or services  when we can be assured of the total purchase price without making significant concessions and when we are assured of our ability to collect from our customer 
we sell to an industry that is highly cyclical with periods of high demand and significant oversupply 
the companies in the semiconductor equipment manufacturing industry continue to consolidate as they are faced with rapidly increasing capital requirements and expensive 
table of contents technological change our top five customers accounted for and of sales in fiscal years and 
in recognizing revenue we make certain assumptions and estimates  namely for our legacy products  we recognize revenue upon product shipment or delivery on the basis that we have a legally enforceable claim on payment and for our newer products  we recognize revenue upon signed customer acceptance 
with respect to the assumption of collectibility from our customers  we assume  based on past history  that we will continue to collect our receivables from them without significant delays in payments or product concessions  despite the fact that they have larger financial size relative to us and despite our dependence on them in a heavily concentrated industry 
we recognize revenue on software licenses upon shipment if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  collection of resulting receivables is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable 
for contracts with multiple obligations eg  maintenance  unspecified upgrades  we allocate revenue to each component of the contract based on objective evidence of its fair value  which is specific to us  or for products not being sold separately  the price established by management 
we recognize revenue allocated to maintenance fees for ongoing customer support and unspecified upgrades ratably over the period of the maintenance contract or upgrade period 
inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we may record charges to write down inventory due to excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory based on an analysis of the impact of changes in technology on our products  the timing of these changes and our estimates of future sales volumes 
these projections of changes in technology and forecasts of future sales are estimates 
beginning in  we are using a rolling twelve month forecast based on anticipated product orders  product order history  forecasts and backlog to assess our inventory requirements 
in the prior year  we used a rolling eighteen month forecast period in our inventory valuation calculations based on our expectations of a turn around in the demand for semiconductor test equipment in we reduced the forecast period to twelve months due to our continued uncertainties in the forecasts of the prober and test sections of the semiconductor equipment industry 
if there is continued weak demand in the semiconductor equipment markets and orders fall below our forecasts  additional write downs of inventories may be required which may negatively impact gross margins in future periods 
due to continued weak demand  we have not extended our forecast period for our inventory valuation calculations as of december  long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of overall market conditions and our market share 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of the long lived assets  thereby requiring us to record additional asset write downs in the future 
warranty we generally warrant our products for a period of twelve months and we accrue a current liability for the estimated cost of warranty upon shipment 
for our legacy products this accrual is based on historical experience and for our newer products this accrual is based on estimates from similar products 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if an unforeseen technical problem arises 
if we experience unforeseen technical problems with our products in future periods to meet our product warranty requirements  revisions to our estimated cost of warranty may be required  and our gross margins will be negatively impacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts we monitor the collectibility of our accounts receivable and record a reserve for doubtful accounts against specifically identified amounts that we believe are uncollectible 
we sell primarily to large  well established semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor test companies and we have not experienced significant doubtful accounts losses in the past 
we have  however  experienced slow downs in 
table of contents receivable collections  especially during semiconductor equipment down cycles  as customers extend their payment schedules to conserve their cash balances 
if our customers continue to experience down cycles or their financial condition were to deteriorate  we may be required to increase our reserve for doubtful accounts 
minority equity investments we have two minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies that are recorded at the original cost less reductions for impairment in value 
in determining if and when certain minority equity investment s decline in value below cost is other than temporary  we evaluate the market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings  price multiples  and other key measures for our investments accounted for at cost 
when we believe such a decline to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period s operating results to the extent of the decline 
for securities that do not have a readily determinable market price  we compare the net carrying amount of our cost method investments to similar equity securities with quoted prices when possible after giving effect to differences in risk premiums  estimated future cash flows  and other factors influencing the market value of the securities 
when comparisons to quoted securities are not practical  we estimate the fair value based on recent sales and purchases of similar unquoted equity securities  independent appraisals  or internally prepared appraisals to estimate the fair value

table of contents as a decrease in our market share for prober products 
historically  the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries have been cyclical 
these conditions adversely impacted our sales for the last two years and are expected to continue during we continue to have limited visibility with respect to the level of orders for the coming quarters 
net sales are comprised of prober and inspection systems  egsoft products  and aftermarket sales consisting primarily of service  spare parts and upgrades in support of the prober and inspection businesses 
service revenue has been less than of annual net sales 
the components of net sales are as follows years ended december  in thousands prober and inspection systems egsoft products aftermarket sales net sales international sales represented  and of net sales for the years  and  respectively 
the decrease in the percentage of international sales in from was primarily due to a decrease in european sales relative to the decline in north american sales 
during and  we experienced weakness across all of our major geographic regions 
the decrease in the percentage of international sales in from was due to a greater decline in european and asian pacific region sales relative to the decline in north american sales 
french sales included in international sales represented  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
sales to japan were denominated in japanese yen 
sales to the rest of asia and europe were primarily denominated in united states dollars  except for france where the invoiced currency was a mix of the united states dollar and the euro 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of sales in gross profit loss gross profit loss was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit in compared to was due primarily to reduced unit sales volumes and high factory fixed costs as a percentage of total costs related to the move of our manufacturing operations to singapore in in addition  we wrote down inventories by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we periodically review the carrying value of our inventories by evaluating material usage and requirements to determine inventory obsolescence and excess quantities  and reduce the inventory value when appropriate 
the write down in fiscal increased over as outlooks for demand in semiconductor equipment in the current cyclical downturn continued to be weak 
we generally warrant our products for a period of twelve months and accrue the estimated cost of warranty upon shipment 
in  due to the transfer of certain manufacturing capabilities to singapore  the accrued liability for estimated cost of warranty was increased by million from the previous year 
in  due to a decrease in net sales  the accrued liability for estimated cost of warranty was reduced by million from the previous year 
we believe that our gross profit will continue to be affected by a number of factors  including competitive pressures  changes in demand for semiconductors  product mix  the proportion of international sales  the level of software sales  our share of the available market  the move of manufacturing to singapore  and excess manufacturing capacity costs 
continued weak demand and changes in market conditions may cause orders to be below forecasts as was experienced throughout and  which may result in excess inventory 
consequently  additional write downs of inventories may be required  which may negatively impact gross profit in future periods 

table of contents engineering  research and development engineering  research and development  or er d expenses were  and  as a percentage of sales  for  and  respectively 
er d expenses were million in and the increase as a percentage of sales was primarily due to lower sales volume and to the transition from mm to mm wafers 
while er d spending was the same in total for both years  in there were increases in outside service and consulting costs related to product development and increased travel  offset by decreased engineering development and reduced headcount related expenses 
in  er d expenses were million  up from million in this increase  as a percentage of sales  was primarily due to lower sales volume in  and the increase in year over year spending resulted from increased prototype expenses in related to new product development programs  as well as increased personnel costs 
during the current business cycle downturn  we intend to control discretionary expenses and continue investing in selective new wafer prober product development programs 
however  we expect engineering  research and development expenses for our inspection products division and egsoft division to decrease in from levels in absolute dollar value 
engineering  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  project materials  consultant fees  and other costs associated with our ongoing efforts in hardware and software product development and enhancement  including expenses for tailoring our products to conform to customer requirements 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative  or sg a expenses were  and  as a percentage of sales  in  and  respectively 
in  sg a expenses were million  up from million in this increase was primarily due to increased promotional and trade show expenses  partially offset by reduced employee costs and sales commissions because of reduced year over year headcount levels 
in  sg a expenses were million  down from million in this decrease was primarily due to reduced employee incentives and sales commissions  mandatory vacations and curtailed discretionary spending 
in process research and development in process research and development was million in this charge in resulted from the write off of in process research and development costs in the acquisition of statware  inc restructuring charges in january  we announced a restructuring plan to reduce our us workforce and exit certain facilities in connection with the relocation of our manufacturing operations to singapore 
during the first three quarters of  employees were designated for termination and employees were terminated with a million charge recorded for severance costs 
as a result of the continued semiconductor equipment downturn  and to better align our cost structure with the market demand for our products  we announced further cost reduction plans in october during the fourth quarter of  a further employees were designated for termination  and ninety four employees were terminated with a charge of million recorded for severance costs 
in september  we announced plans to close our sales office in japan 
six employees were designated for termination and five were terminated during the fourth quarter 
a restructuring charge of million was recorded for severance payments  legal and accounting fees incurred related to the closure  and write down of assets 

table of contents in october  we announced the closing of additional offices in europe and asia 
thirty two employees were designated for termination  and twenty three were terminated as a result of these closures 
a restructuring charge of million was recorded for severance payments  legal and accounting fees incurred related to the closures  write down of assets held for disposal  and other costs 
we anticipate further restructuring charges in for workforce reduction  idled facilities and obsolete equipment as the move of our manufacturing operations to singapore progresses to completion  and based on economic conditions 
as the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and our business largely depends on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers  the timing  length and severity of the up and down cycles are difficult to predict and affects our ability to accurately forecast future revenues and expense levels 
during a down cycle  we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions  which could therefore require us to have additional layoffs  and incur additional restructuring charges 
if this situation occurs  these restructuring costs will materially affect our normal cash flows 
impairment charges as a result of our assessment of current market conditions and their related effect on our business plan  we concluded that there were indications of impairment of our long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we performed an impairment test  which compared each division s net book values with the expected undiscounted cash flows from these assets  which consisted primarily of property and equipment and non current assets 
the cash flows over the estimated remaining useful lives of these assets were not sufficient to recover the net book value of these assets 
we obtained a valuation report outlining the estimated fair value of the assets  based on quoted market prices  from an independent appraiser and recorded an impairment charge of million to write the carrying value of certain fixed assets and non current assets held for use in the prober division down to their estimated fair values 
in  we also recorded million related to the write down of our long term investment in nanonexus 
although we do not anticipate that we will be required to record additional impairment charges  the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and the severity of these cycles is difficult to predict 
during a down cycle  we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions  which could therefore require us to record additional impairment charges 
interest income expense  net interest income expense  net was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the year over year decreases were principally due to declining interest rates and lower average yearly cash and short term investment balances 
gain on revaluation of warrants in june  we completed a million private placement of convertible subordinated notes due and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
in september  upon registration of our notes  warrants  and the shares of common stock into which the notes and warrants are convertible  the warrants  which were initially valued at million and classified as a liability  were revalued using the black scholes option pricing model to million and reclassified to equity 
this revaluation resulted in a gain on revaluation of million 
upon registration of the notes  warrants  and shares of common stock into which the notes and warrants are convertible  the re measured value of the warrants was reclassified to permanent equity and accordingly will not be required to be revalued subsequently 

table of contents other income expense  net other income expense  net was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
in  this amount consisted primarily of interest expense on the convertible notes 
in  the amount consisted primarily of rental income from a facilities sublease offset by foreign exchange losses 
in  the amount consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses 
provision benefit for income taxes the income tax benefit was million in as compared to income tax provisions of million and million in and  respectively 
the income tax benefit primarily resulted from a million additional refund due to a change in tax law arising from the enactment of the job creation and worker assistance act of and a million reversal of previously recorded income tax reserves for tax years up to and including relating principally to changes in estimates of these tax reserves 
realization of our deferred tax assets depends on us generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of such realization  our management concluded that a full valuation allowance of million was required at december  the tax provision of million in increased over the tax provision of million in primarily because of the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our total net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  cash used in operating activities was million for the year this included a net loss of million  offset by non cash charges of million and a decrease in net operating assets of million 
non cash charges consisted primarily of million depreciation and amortization  million of impairment charges  a million loss on disposal of equipment  million realized foreign exchange loss on the closure of our japan office  partially offset by the million gain on revaluation of warrants and a million decrease in deferred software revenue 
the decrease in net operating assets was due primarily to a decrease of million in accounts receivable  a decrease of million in inventories due to increased inventory write downs  and an increase of million in accounts payable 
this was partially offset by a decrease of million in accrued liabilities primarily due to acceptance and payments received on deferred revenue 
cash provided by investing activities was million due primarily to net investment maturities of million and proceeds from disposal of assets of million 
this was offset partially by an increase in capital expenditures of million principally for network infrastructure and capitalized costs of implementing our enterprise resource planning erp system as well as capitalized setup costs of the singapore manufacturing facility and other assets of million 
in june  we completed a million private placement of fixed rate convertible subordinated notes due and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the net proceeds from this placement were million 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on june and december of each year 
annual interest payments are million  and will result in a charge to interest expense until the end of the term of the notes 
the convertible notes initially enabled the holders to convert principal amounts owed under the notes into an aggregate of  shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the notes contain a beneficial conversion feature  which is triggered if of the average market price for consecutive trading days prior to february  is less than the conversion price 
on february   this feature was triggered 
as a result  the conversion price was lowered to per share and an additional  common shares will be issuable upon conversion of the notes 
this adjustment to the conversion price will also result in a million non cash charge to interest expense in our first quarter fiscal results of operations 

table of contents additional cash provided by financing activities consisted of million of proceeds from the sale of common stock under employee stock plans offset by the million payoff of a bank loan in japan 
our japanese subsidiary had a credit facility with a total borrowing capacity of approximately million denominated in yen with a japanese bank  which has been terminated due to the japan office closure 
we placed million cash collateral with the us branch of the japanese bank to guarantee the credit facility 
during the third quarter of  we paid off the outstanding balance and cancelled the credit facility 
in march  we entered into a million  five year synthetic lease for approximately acres of land in san jose  california 
a synthetic lease is a form of operating lease wherein a third party lessor funds of the acquisition and construction costs relating to one or more properties to be leased to a lessee 
the lessor is the owner of the leased property and must provide at least of the required funds in the form of at risk equity 
in july  the lease agreement was amended to provide a construction allowance 
that amendment also extended the expiration date of the lease to july  the lease agreement was further amended and effective in june  required a mandatory collateralization of million  which was included in restricted cash on our balance sheet 
this amendment also included an adjustment to the interest rate and certain restrictions on the repurchase of our common stock 
on august   the lease was further modified into a self funding structure 
under this new structure  third parties funded of the lease balance and we funded the remaining through a loan to the lessor  which is reflected as a long term lease receivable on our balance sheet 
this amendment also included adjustments to the interest rate and certain restrictive covenants  which were effective as of june  furthermore  the self funding structure reduced the mandatory collateralization amount to million  which is equal to the amount advanced by the third parties and not self funded by us and is included in restricted cash on our balance sheet 
the monthly lease payments on the portion of the lease balance self funded by us are based on the london interbank offering rate  or libor 
these amounts are the same as the interest payments due to us on the loan to the lessor 
the monthly lease payments on the portion of the lease balance funded by the third parties are based on libor plus basis points  provided the mandatory collateralization amount remains at the full million advanced by the third parties 
based on current interest rates  and the lease balance of approximately million at december   the total gross lease payments over the remainder of the lease term will be approximately million 
in december  we received a fair market appraisal of our san jose campus of million  million less than the guaranteed residual lease value of million 
under eitf  implementation issues in accounting for leasing transactions involving special purpose entities  beginning on the date the deficiency becomes probable  the expected deficiency is accrued by the lessee using the straight line method over the remaining term of the lease 
because we provided the lessor with a notice electing an early designated sale date to purchase of the leased assets in march  the gross lease payments have been calculated over the remaining four months of the lease 
accrual of a deficiency by a lessee is required regardless of whether the lessee expects to exercise a purchase or renewal option at the end of the lease term 
thus  we began amortizing the million deficiency with a million charge to rent expense in december an additional million charge to rent expense will be reflected in the first quarter financials 
at december   we were in compliance with all but one of the restrictive covenants contained in the amended lease agreement 
as a result  we requested and received a waiver to the covenant for the remaining term of the lease agreement from the third party lenders 
on january   we provided the lessor with a notice electing an early designated sale date and we completed the purchase of the leased assets in march the long term lease receivable and cash collateral were used to fund the purchase price 
the property and equipment  including closing costs  were recorded at approximately million 
as a result of the purchase  depreciation expense will increase by approximately million per year  and rent expense and interest income will decrease by approximately million and million  respectively  per year based on current interest rates 
in connection with their ongoing consolidations project  the fasb issued fasb no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 in january for pre existing transactions  the 
table of contents consolidation requirements generally become operative in the third quarter of because we completed the purchase of the property in march  we have concluded that fasb no 
does not have an impact on our current or future financial statements 
in january  we entered into a three year operating lease for a  square foot manufacturing facility in singapore with annual lease payments of approximately million 
as of december   we spent approximately million for leasehold improvements and equipment to outfit this facility 
our principal source of liquidity as of december  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
historically  we have generated cash in an amount sufficient to fund our operations 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources and cash flow generated from future operations will enable us to continue our planned operations and our planned capital expenditures through the end of fiscal  including our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as shown in the table below 
however  we may need to raise additional funds in the foreseeable future to fund our operations 
if our stock price and trading volume remain at current levels or decrease  or if business conditions in our core prober business do not improve  additional funds would probably not be available to us on favorable terms and might not be available at all 
if unavailable  our ability to run our business could be impaired

under the new rules  we will be required to recognize a liability when the liability is incurred rather than as of the date that we make a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
we are assessing the impact on the financial statements resulting from adoption of this standard 
in connection with their ongoing consolidations project  the fasb issued fasb no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no

the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for our fiscal year the interim disclosure requirements are effective for the first quarter of fiscal we continue to account for stock based compensation using apb and have not adopted the recognition provisions of sfas  as amended by sfas the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the eitf issued eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable  and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
this issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
this issue does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
this issue is applicable for the company for fiscal and could have an impact on revenue recognition of future sales transactions 
factors that may affect results and financial condition semiconductor industry downturns adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
our business largely depends on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products that use integrated circuits 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has historically experienced periods of oversupply resulting in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment 
the timing  length and severity of the up and down cycles are difficult to predict and affect our ability to accurately forecast future revenues and expense levels 
during a down cycle  we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions 
our ability to reduce expenses may be limited by the need to invest in the engineering  research and development  and marketing required to penetrate targeted markets and maintain extensive customer service and support 
during periods of rapid growth  we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand 
there can be no assurance that these objectives can be met  which would likely materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
our quarterly results are subject to variability and uncertainty  which could negatively impact our stock price 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly results 
our backlog at the beginning of each quarter does not necessarily determine actual sales for any succeeding period 
our sales will often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter that they are received 
moreover  customers may cancel or reschedule shipments  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
other factors that may influence our operating results in a particular quarter include the timing of the receipt of orders from major customers  product mix  competitive pricing pressures  the relative proportions of domestic and international sales  our ability to design  manufacture and introduce new products on a cost effective and timely basis  the delay between expenses to further develop marketing and service capabilities and the realization of benefits from those improved capabilities  and the introduction of new products by our competitors 
accordingly  our results of operations are subject to significant variability and uncertainty from quarter to quarter  which could adversely affect our stock price 
if we do not continue to develop and successfully market new products  our business will be negatively affected 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and to develop and manufacture new products  particularly those related to implementation of our strategy to become a process management tool provider 
as a result  we expect to continue to make 
table of contents investments in engineering  research and development 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the introduction  marketing and cost effective manufacture of any of our new products  that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner  enhance our existing products and processes to satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance  or that the new markets for which we are developing new products or expect to sell current products  such as the market for mm wafer probers  markets related to the growth in the use of flip chips  and the market for process management software will develop sufficiently 
to develop new products successfully  we depend on close relationships with our customers and the willingness of those customers to share information with us 
the failure to develop products and introduce them successfully and in a timely manner could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations 
our results of operations will be negatively impacted if one or more of our major customers stops purchasing or significantly reduces the purchasing of our products 
for the years ended december   and  five of our customers accounted for  and  respectively  of our net sales 
in  stmicroelectronics and cypress semiconductor accounted for and of net sales 
in  stmicroelectronics accounted for of net sales 
in  stmicroelectronics  philips and atmel accounted for  and of net sales  respectively 
if one or more of our major customers ceased or significantly curtailed its purchases  it would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we do not successfully compete in the markets in which we do business  our business and results of operations will be negatively affected 
our major competitors in the prober market segment are tokyo electron limited  or tel  and tokyo seimitsu  or tsk 
the major competitors in the post fab inspection market segment are august technologies and robotic vision systems inc  or rvsi 
the main competitors in the process management software market segment are kla tencor and brooks automation 
some of our competitors have greater financial  engineering and manufacturing resources than we do as well as larger service organizations and long standing customer relationships 
our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price performance characteristics 
competitive pressures may force price reductions that could adversely affect our results of operations 
although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors  maintaining and capitalizing on these advantages will require us to continue a high level of investment in engineering  research and development  marketing  and customer service and support 
we can not assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages 
for further discussion regarding the competition we face  see business competition 
our outstanding convertible debt may create an impediment to  or a reduction in value to our stockholders from  a sale or merger of the company  may be required to be repaid if not converted prior to its maturity  and may  if converted  result in additional dilution to holders of our common stock  all of which may adversely affect the value of our common stock 
in june  we issued million in convertible notes and related warrants 
the notes entitle the holders to convert the notes into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  significantly in excess of recent trading prices of our common stock 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we also issued warrants for the purchase of  shares of our common stock that are exercisable at a price of per share  also significantly in excess of recent trading prices of our common stock 
in certain circumstances we may force the conversion of all or a portion of the notes and may also redeem the notes 
however  unless prior to june the price of our common stock exceeds at least per share  we cannot cause the automatic conversion of the notes and we will be obligated to pay the notes in full at maturity 
we may voluntarily redeem the notes between june and june for an aggregate redemption price of as high as approximately million plus accrued interest 
in addition  unless waived or renegotiated  we are obligated to pay the holders of the notes an amount equal to million plus accrued interest in the event of a sale  merger or other change in control of the company 
because of the challenges we face in the japanese market segment  we cannot assure you we will successfully penetrate that market 
we believe that competing japanese companies in the prober market segment have a competitive advantage because they dominate the japanese market segment  comprised of semiconductor 
table of contents fabrication facilities located in japan and those located outside japan that are controlled by japanese companies 
we have found it difficult to penetrate the large japanese market  which represents a significant percentage of the worldwide wafer prober market 
while japanese semiconductor manufacturers in recent years have begun to build semiconductor fabrication facilities outside japan  we have not yet had significant sales into such facilities 
further  japanese semiconductor manufacturers have extended their influence outside japan by licensing products and process technologies to non japanese semiconductor manufacturers 
these licenses typically include a recommendation to use wafer probers and other semiconductor equipment manufactured by japanese companies 
in particular  we may be at competitive disadvantage with respect to the japanese semiconductor capital equipment suppliers who have been engaged for some time in collaborative efforts with japanese semiconductor manufacturers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish a significant presence in or ever compete successfully in the japanese market segment 
in addition  to the extent that the slowdown in the japanese market segment has left our japanese competitors with excess inventory or excess capacity  they may offer substantial discounts on their products  increasing pricing pressure in both the japanese market segment and elsewhere 
furthermore  the weakness of the yen compared to the dollar may exacerbate this situation 
if we do not successfully protect our intellectual property  our business could be negatively impacted 
our success depends in significant part on our intellectual property 
while we attempt to protect our intellectual property through patents  copyrights and trade secrets  we believe that our success will depend more upon innovation  technological expertise and distribution strength 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
no assurance can be given that the claims allowed on any patents we hold will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any patents issued to us will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with competitive advantages 
some customers using certain of our products have received a notice of infringement from technivison corporation and the lemelson medical education research foundation  or lemelson  alleging that the manufacture of semiconductor products infringes certain patents currently held by lemelson 
certain of these customers have notified us that  in the event it is subsequently determined that the customer infringes certain of the lemelson patents  they may seek reimbursement from us for some damages or expenses resulting from this matter 
we have in turn notified our suppliers that  in the event  it is subsequently determined that our customers are determined to infringe and that we are responsible for any associated costs and fees  that it may seek reimbursement for the resultant costs and fees 
we believe that our products do not infringe the lemelson patents 
certain of our customers are currently engaged in litigation with lemelson involving of its patents  and the validity of those patents has been placed in issue 
the trial ended in january  post trial briefs will be reviewed and it is expected that a decision will be made during the second half of in the future  it is possible that our participation in the litigation may be required 
we may incur costs with respect to such participation and cannot predict the outcome of this or similar litigation or the effect of such litigation on our business 
to the best of our knowledge  lemelson has not asserted that we may be liable for infringing its patents 
disruptions or termination of some of our key sources of supplies could damage our customer relations and harm our business 
we use numerous suppliers to supply components and subassemblies for the manufacture and support of our products and systems 
while we make reasonable efforts to ensure that such components and subassemblies are available from multiple suppliers  this is not always possible 
although we seek to reduce our dependence on these limited source suppliers  disruption or termination of certain of these sources could occur and such disruptions could have at least a temporary adverse effect on our results of operations and damage customer relationships 
moreover  a prolonged inability to obtain certain components  or a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not successfully address the challenges inherent in conducting international sales and operations  our business and results of operations will be negatively impacted 
we have experienced a decline in our international sales and operations 
international sales accounted for  and of our net sales for  
table of contents and  respectively 
we expect international sales to continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales 
we are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets  one or more of which could adversely affect our international sales and operations  including the imposition of government controls on our business and or business partners  fluctuations in the us dollar  which could increase our foreign sales prices in local currencies  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of technology  changes in tariffs  legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  longer payment cycles  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in foreign countries  withholding taxes that limit the repatriation of earnings  trade barriers and restrictions  immigration regulations that limit our ability to deploy employees  political instability  war and acts of terrorism  and variations in effective income tax rates among countries where we conduct business 
although these and similar regulatory  geopolitical and global economic factors have not yet had a material adverse effect on our operations  there can be no assurance that such factors will not adversely impact our operations in the future or require us to modify our current business practices 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries where we do business may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
if we do not realize cost savings from moving the manufacture of our probers to singapore  our business and results of operations will be negatively impacted 
in january  we announced plans to move prober manufacturing to singapore to realize potential cost savings of to once full production is reached 
we have recorded a restructuring charge of million for in connection with this move 
we cannot assure you that we will realize cost savings  however  expenses related to the move will adversely affect operating results 
our business will be harmed if we cannot hire and retain key employees 
our future success partly depends on our ability to retain key personnel 
we also need to attract additional skilled personnel in all areas to grow our business 
while many of our current employees have many years of service us  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future 
future acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business and operating results 
we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines  technologies or businesses 
acquisitions by us may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  and amortization expenses related to intangible assets  which could materially adversely affect our profitability 
we may experience charges such as goodwill or impairment charges related to future acquisitions

our charter documents and shareholders rights plan  as well as delaware law  could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our shareholders rights plan and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in our control 
such provisions could diminish the opportunities for a stockholder to participate in tender offers  including tender offers at a price above the then current market value of our common stock 
such provisions may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from takeover attempts 
in addition  the board of directors  without further stockholder approval  may issue additional series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in our control 
the issuance of additional series of preferred stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
we have no current plans to issue any preferred stock
