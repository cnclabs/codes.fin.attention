the company is currently evaluating new credit facilities to support the company s expansion of its remaining three business lines and to support the company s letters of credit requirements thereby releasing the cash collateral of approximately million to be used for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
the company has historically competed in a niche market where it generally purchases fuel from major oil companies and refiners using credit terms which on average are shorter than the credit terms the company 
table of contents offers its fuel customers 
because of its bulk buying and credit worthiness the company is able to purchase fuel at a lower price than its customers 
typically  the company buys on terms that range from days to days and sells on terms ranging up to days 
as a result  the company requires access to sufficient credit facilities which may need to increase in the future as the company expands its business 
the amount of working capital consumed by the company has depended and is expected to depend primarily on the quantity and the price of fuel bought and sold  the company s extension of credit to its customers  customers compliance with the company s credit terms and the credit terms extended to the company by its suppliers 
any increase in the quantity and or price of fuel sold or in credit terms extended to its customers and or any reduction in credit terms extended to the company by its suppliers and or any substantial customer noncompliance with the company s credit terms can result in a corresponding increase in the company s working capital requirements 
under these circumstances  the company s liquidity could be adversely affected unless the company is able to increase vendor credit or increase lending limits under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company believes  however  that its current financing arrangements and vendor credit terms should provide the company with sufficient liquidity in the event of a temporary surge in fuel oil prices 
however  to the extent that the revolving credit facility or any other credit facility is used to fund increased working capital requirements  the company will incur additional debt service costs the company s accounts receivable balance as of june  was million 
the company s accounts receivable are primarily comprised of customer trade receivables net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
the company s credit risk is based in part on the following factors a substantial portion of the customer trade receivables are related to a single industry aviation and at any given point in time  one or several customers may owe a significant balance to the company 
at june   mercfuel s accounts receivable comprised of the company s total receivable 
of mercfuel s receivables  approximately of the customers comprised of the total receivables with an average balance of million for these customers 
the company s mercfuel operations accounted for approximately of the company s total revenue in fiscal year as of june   mercfuel customers comprise approximately of the company s total accounts receivable due from what the company defines as smaller and generally less well established or well capitalized airlines  including certain foreign  regional  commuter and start up airlines 
these customers are affected by fluctuations in the economy in general and in the aviation industry specifically 
for example  a material rise in the price of aviation fuel tends to adversely impact these types of customers 
to the extent that mercfuel s airline customers are not able to immediately adjust their business operations to reflect increased operating costs  they could take relatively longer to pay the company s accounts receivable 
such payment delays would further increase the company s working capital demands 
in some cases  the impact of such economic fluctuations could materially impair the financial stability of an airline customer such that it would be unable to pay amounts owed to the company and could result in such airline customer filing for bankruptcy protection 
in that event  mercury could incur significant losses related to the uncollectability of the receivables 
the company has incurred in the past and is likely to continue to incur losses as the result of the business failure of a customer 
the company assesses its credit portfolio on an ongoing basis and establishes allowances which the company believes are adequate to absorb potential credit problems that can be reasonably anticipated 
this assessment includes an analysis of past due accounts as well as a review of accounts with significant balances 
allowances are established for all or some portion of past due balances based upon various factors  including the extent of delinquency  financial conditions of delinquent customers and amounts of insurance and collateral  if any 
accounts receivable sales days outstanding were days and days as of june  and  respectively 
accounts receivable days sales outstanding have historically been impacted by a high volume of fuel sales to customers with extended payment terms 
however  during fiscal year  the company added a large customer  airtran airways  whose terms are prepaid 
the terms of the prepayment provide for weekly payments equal to the following week s estimated sales 
this prepaid customer accounted for approximately and of the company s consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
in april  the company received a notice from lawa of a proposed rent increase for the avion warehouse retroactive to june  in response to this notice  the company submitted protests to the 
table of contents lawa staff and board of commissioners regarding the proposed increase on the basis that the company had made a substantial investment in the warehouse facility and the proposed rental increase would greatly reduce the company s ability to achieve an acceptable rate of return on the company s investment to date  if any increase is to be made  it should be determined based on the company being the developer of the facility and not strictly a tenant  and that the amount of the proposed increase is not justified given the general business environment of the air cargo handling operations 
in response to the company s protests to the proposed increase  in september the company received a revised notice from lawa of a reduced proposal for a rental increase for the avion warehouse 
the lawa staff intend to present their recommended rental increase to the lawa board of commissioners for approval in late january from june  through june   the accumulated amount of the retroactive rent increase is  which will be partially offset by recoverable retroactive sublease rental income of  the lawa staff has indicated that the retroactive portion of the rent increase would be payable by the company in equal monthly installments over the remaining term of the lease agreement  which is scheduled to expire in june the proposed monthly rent  on a go forward basis  would increase by  or  from the existing monthly rent 
the company has accrued  for the retroactive rent adjustment  which is net of the increased recoverable retroactive sublease rental income  as of june   and has accrued an additional  on a quarterly basis in fiscal  resulting in a total accrual of  as of june  as discussed in item business under restatement and note to the consolidated financial statements  the fiscal financial statements and each of the first three quarters of fiscal were restated related to this retroactive rent increase 
the company s most recent recurring capital expenditure requirements have been related to the maintenance and expansion of the company s air center facilities 
during fiscal year  the company completed the construction of a hangar at the bedford fbo at a cost of approximately million  incurred primarily during fiscal years and this hangar was sold in conjunction with the sale of the bedford facility at the end of fiscal year the company spent approximately million for the construction of a new hangar at the jackson air center during fiscal year absent a major prolonged surge in oil prices or a capital intensive acquisition  the company believes its operating cash flow  senior credit facility  vendor credit and cash balance will provide it with sufficient liquidity during the next twelve months 
in the event that fuel prices increase significantly for an extended period of time  the company s liquidity could be adversely affected unless the company is able to increase vendor credit or increase lending limits under its revolving credit facility 
the company believes  however  its revolving credit and vendor credit should provide it with sufficient liquidity in the event of a major temporary surge in oil prices
