item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
as referenced in the first paragraph of part i  this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
for a more complete understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  and some of the risks and trends that could affect future results  see other factors affecting operating results  liquidity and capital resources in this item overview marimba  inc was incorporated in delaware in february we develop  market and support software change management and software configuration management solutions 
our products help customers reduce their total cost of information technology it ownership and improve quality of it service by streamlining the distribution and management of software applications and content 
our customer base spans multiple industries  including financial services  healthcare  insurance  manufacturing and telecommunications 
we market our products worldwide through a combination of a direct sales force and resellers 
revenues to date have been derived primarily from the license of our products and to a lesser extent from support and maintenance  consulting and training services  although recently support revenue has comprised a larger percentage of our revenues 
customers who license our products generally purchase maintenance contracts  typically covering a month period 
additionally  customers may purchase consulting services  which are customarily billed at a fixed daily rate plus out of pocket expenses 
we also offer training services that are billed on a per student or per class session basis 
since inception  we have made substantial investments in sales  marketing and research and development to expand and enhance our product lines and increase the market awareness of marimba and our products 
we have incurred significant losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of approximately million at december  we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to increase our customer base and on growth in our market overall 
accordingly  over the long term  we intend to continue to invest heavily in sales  marketing and research and development 
in view of the rapidly changing nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of revenues and operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance  growth or financial results 
additionally  historical trends may not be indicative of future growth or financial results 
critical accounting policies and estimates discussion and analysis of marimba s financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
the sec has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
see note of the financial statements for more information about these critical accounting policies  as well as descriptions of other significant accounting policies 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues primarily from two sources license revenues  which consist of software license fees  and service revenues  which are comprised of fees for maintenance and support  consulting and training 
revenue recognition rules are complex  and require our management to exercise judgment and make a number of estimates 
for example  most of our contracts contain multiple element arrangements  which require us to make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver  to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
we also evaluate whether a risk of concession exists with regards to specific contracts or customers  and also whether there is any material risk of customer non payment or product returns 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
revenue that we cannot recognize in a particular period is reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized over time as the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
these estimates are made based upon all of the information available to us at the time 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any given period if different judgments are made or different estimates are utilized 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through a charge to our general and administrative expenses 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay or suggest that a particular market sector is more prone to liquidity issues 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate subsequent to the date of our arrangements with them  this could result in an impairment of their ability to make payments and additional allowances would be required 
returns 
prior to december   we maintained a returns reserve  established through a debit to license revenue 
the reserve was for estimated losses resulting from the possibility of product returns by customers 
at december   we analyzed our past returns history  and combined with changed business practices we determined that a reserve was no longer appropriate 
as a result of this analysis  the entire reserve was reversed in the fourth quarter of  resulting in a net increase to license revenue of  during the fourth quarter and  during fiscal year if in the future we experience customer returns  this may materially negatively impact our business 
compensation accruals 
marimba records an accrual of compensation expenses which reflects compensation earned but not paid prior to the end of each period 
the primary components of this accrual are commissions related to sales  variable compensation programs for non executives  and executive bonuses 
these compensation programs may contain elements that are based upon both quarterly and annual performance  and we are required to estimate these payouts based upon the knowledge we have at the time we report our results 
the use of different judgments and estimates could have the affect of increasing or decreasing reported compensation costs in any given period 
in particular  estimates of annual results made when recording charges early in any fiscal year could  if proven incorrect  result in significant adjustments in later parts of the year as events unfold and our estimates are refined 
for example  during fiscal we accrued executive and employee bonuses during the first and second quarter 
subsequent to year end  we determined that certain accrued bonuses would not be paid  and as a result we reversed these accruals in the fourth quarter results  which had the effect of reducing our expenses in the fourth quarter by approximately  july legal settlement 
on july   the court approved a settlement between marimba and beck systems  as described in the notes to the financial statements 
under the terms of the agreement for the settlement  marimba obtained a license to beck systems patents 
the amount charged to cost of license revenues during the quarter ended june  was based on the apportionment of the total amount which related to payment for the alleged past infringement 
the remaining amount  which was recorded as acquired 
table of contents technology during the third quarter of and is being amortized to cost of license revenues over a five year period  represents the proportion of the total settlement relating to the future benefit to marimba of the ongoing license to beck systems patents 
the amounts allocated to the expense and the asset were based  respectively  on our license revenues since inception versus our projection of the revenue relating to the technology that we expect to generate over the next years 
management s assumptions about future revenues and the period over which our product will embed the patented technology required significant judgment 
our revenues have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so 
in addition  it is not clear how long our products will include the patented technology 
if we had made a different estimate of future revenues or the period over which our product will embed the patented technology  the apportionment of the settlement amount between the charge relating to the alleged past infringement and the acquired technology asset would have been different 
acquired technology 
we review our acquired technology for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
we do not perform a periodic assessment of assets for impairment in the absence of such information or indicators 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
contingencies and litigation 
we are sometimes subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss contingency required  if any  for these matters is made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
established loss contingencies may change and new loss contingencies may be established as the facts and circumstances of each matter changes 
results of operation the following table presents selected financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  statement of operations data revenues license service total revenues cost of revenues license service total cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses net loss 
table of contents revenues the following table presents selected revenue data for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands revenues license service total revenues percentage of total revenues license service total revenues in were million  compared to revenues of million in both and the decrease in total revenues was due to a decrease in license revenues  partially offset by an increase in service revenues 
the decrease in license revenues and increase in service revenues are discussed below 
license revenues 
license revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in license revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in license revenues in fiscal included  from the reversal of our sales return allowance reserve  based on our evaluation of our past history of returns 
overall  the decrease in license revenues since was due primarily to a generally weak it spending environment that led to lower deal sizes and longer sales cycles 
the following table presents the license revenues derived from each of our product lines as a percentage of total license revenues note that prior to  sales of embedded management products were included with the desktop mobile management product line year ended december  percentage of total license revenues desktop mobile management server management embedded management service revenues 
service revenues include support and maintenance  consulting and training 
service revenues increased  or  to million in from million in service revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in the increase in service revenues since was due primarily to the increase in support and maintenance revenues 
support and maintenance revenues are driven by new license sales and by renewals of existing annual maintenance contracts 
the downturn in sales of licenses during may negatively impact service revenues in the future 
the following table presents the components of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  percentage of total service revenues consulting support and maintenance training 
table of contents as a percentage of total revenues  service revenues were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in service revenues as a percentage of total revenues was due primarily to lower license revenues since international 
revenues outside the united states represented approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
international revenues increased by million  or  to approximately million in when compared to in  international revenues increased by million  or  to approximately million from million in the increase in revenues outside the united states was due primarily to our sales and marketing efforts in europe and more specifically to our expansion in the united kingdom and france 
the following table presents our revenues by regions as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  revenue united states europe other regions costs of revenues cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of the cost of third party software technology that was either integrated into our products or resold by us 
cost of license revenues was million   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of license revenues in was due primarily to a million charge recorded in the second quarter of in relation to the legal settlement of a patent dispute  which involved a patent license  and to a lesser extent an increase in sales of third party products 
we expect to record additional charges to cost of license revenues of approximately  per quarter over the next five years in connection with this patent settlement 
the following table presents our gross margin on license revenues year ended december  in thousands license revenues cost of license revenues gross margin on license revenues gross margin on license revenues as a percentage of license revenues cost of service revenues 
cost of service revenues includes salaries and related expenses of our customer service and training organizations  salaries and related expenses of our consultants for billable consulting engagements  cost of third parties contracted to provide consulting services to our customers  and an allocation of our facilities  depreciation and certain other overhead expenses 
cost of service revenues was million  million and million in  and  representing  and of service revenue  respectively

during  the gross margin was negatively impacted by a million charge in cost of license revenues related to a legal settlement involving a patent license  and by the decrease in license revenues as a percentage of total revenues 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist primarily of salaries and related costs of our engineering organization  fees paid to third party consultants  if any  and an allocation of our facilities  depreciation and certain other overhead expenses 
we believe that our success is dependent in large part on the continued enhancement of our current products and the ability to develop new  technologically advanced products that meet the sophisticated requirements of our customers 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in absolute dollars was due primarily to workforce reductions announced in july and april  as well as our decisions during the second quarter of to discontinue the development of a hosting service and separately close our houston development facility 
over time  we plan to increase our expenses in research and development activities as we continue to enhance our products 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of our sales and marketing organizations  sales commissions  costs of our marketing programs  including public relations  advertising  trade shows  collateral sales materials  and seminars  rent and facilities costs associated with our regional and international sales offices  and an allocation of our facilities  depreciation and certain other overhead expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
from to  sales and marketing expenses decreased in absolute dollars due primarily to fewer promotional activities  reductions of headcount in sales management  and lower commissions as a result of lower sales 
from to  sales and marketing expenses increased due primarily to growth in the sales organization during the first half of  expansion of marimba s sales operation in the united kingdom and telemarketing expenses 
over time  we expect to increase our investment in sales and marketing in our efforts to grow revenues and expand our brand awareness 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs of our finance  human resources and legal services organizations  insurance premiums and third party legal and other professional services fees  and an allocation of our facilities  depreciation and certain other overhead expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased in absolute dollars from to due primarily to reductions of headcount and general cost cutting measures 
general and administrative expenses were higher in compared with due primarily to the settlement of patent disputes and an increase in the bad debt provision of approximately million in restructuring 
in april  we eliminated approximately of our workforce  or employees and independent contractors across all company departments 
we recorded a charge of  in the second quarter of related to the restructuring plan 
of this amount   of the restructuring accrual was reduced by cash payments made during the year ended december  and the remaining balance of  was reversed out in once we determined that all outstanding obligations had been settled 
in july  we eliminated approximately of our workforce  or employees  across all company departments 
we recorded a restructuring charge of  in connection with this plan  which consisted of charges of  for severance and benefits related to the workforce reduction  offset by a  adjustment from the charge for our april restructuring plan 
deferred compensation 
we record deferred compensation representing the difference between the exercise prices of options granted to acquire shares of common stock and the deemed fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on the grant dates 
we also record deferred compensation to represent the intrinsic value of certain restricted stock awards 
deferred compensation is amortized over the vesting periods of the options and stock using the graded vesting method 
in  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately million net of reduction of million due to forfeited stock options and repurchased shares  which represented the intrinsic value of certain stock awards 
in  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately  net of reduction of million due to forfeited stock options and repurchased shares  which represented the intrinsic value of certain stock awards 
in  we recorded a reversal in deferred compensation of approximately  net of reduction of  due to forfeited stock options and repurchased shares  which represented the intrinsic value of certain stock awards 
deferred compensation is being amortized over the vesting periods of the stock options and stock using the graded vesting method 
we amortized deferred compensation expense  net of gains resulting from the forfeiture of stock options and repurchase of shares due to employee departures  of million   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
this compensation expense relates to stock options and stock awarded to individuals in all operating expense categories 

table of contents interest income and other expenses  net interest income  net  consists primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments offset by other miscellaneous expenses 
interest income  net was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income  net  from to to was due primarily to lower invested cash balances and lower interest rates 
year ended december  in thousands average cash  short term and long term investments interest income average return provision for income taxes marimba s provision for income taxes for the years ended december   and consists of state income  franchise taxes and foreign taxes 
no provision for federal taxes has been recorded  because we have experienced operating losses from inception through as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we also had a federal research and development tax credit carryforward of approximately million at that date 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations contained in the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions and this annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss and credits before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and and million of short term and long term investments in marketable securities  respectively 
cash equivalents consisted of financial instruments  which are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition 
investments with remaining maturities of less than one year are considered short term and the ones with maturities longer than one year are considered long term investments 
investments are reported at fair market value and are managed by professional investment managers 
net cash used in operating activities decreased to million during from million in  due primarily to a smaller decrease in deferred revenues from to  compared to the decrease from to  and to lower direct personnel expenses due to restructuring measures 
net cash used in investing activities increased to million in from  in due primarily to net purchases of short term investments and the acquisition of technology in relation to the legal settlement of a patent dispute 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased from million in to  in  due to lower proceeds from stock option exercises in and a million receivable balance under a purchase facility with a bank in total liquidity and capital resources decreased by million from to and by million from to this decrease in total capital resources is primarily due to cash used in operating activities and to a million cash payment in relation to the legal settlement of a patent dispute in 
table of contents year ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalent short term investments long term investments total capital resources our primary contractual obligations consist of noncancellable operating lease agreements 
as of december   future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases for the period through are expected to be approximately million  as presented in the table below operating leases in thousands year ending december and thereafter total minimum lease payments we currently anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we could experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek financing  or at some point in the future we may otherwise seek financing to support our long term operations 
in any such event  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility 
any additional financing  if needed  might not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business and operating results 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our stockholders would be reduced 
approval of non audit services during the quarter ended december   there were no additional non audit services performed by marimba s independent accountants that had not been previously approved by the audit committee 
recent accounting pronouncements on july   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

the standard replaces eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
sfas is effective prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that we recognize the fair value for guarantee and indemnification arrangements issued or modified by us after december   if these 
table of contents arrangements are within the scope of the interpretation 
in addition  we must continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the guarantees and indemnifications  as required under previously existing generally accepted accounting principles  in order to identify if a loss has occurred 
if we determine it is probable that a loss has occurred  then any such estimable loss would be recognized under those guarantees and indemnifications 
some of the software licenses that we have granted contain provisions that indemnify licensees of the software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
we have historically received only a limited number of requests for indemnification under these provisions and have not been required to make material payments pursuant to these provisions 
accordingly  we have not recorded a liability related to these indemnification provisions 
we will be required to implement the provisions of fin as of january  and do not believe that fin will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
statement amends fasb statement no 
s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
statement also amends the disclosure provisions of statement and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
we have adopted the disclosure provisions for this form k 
we will continue to account for stock based compensation under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees using the intrinsic value method 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
for a description of the other accounting pronouncements that may apply to our financial results  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
other factors affecting operating results  liquidity and capital resources the factors discussed below are cautionary statements that identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
for more information regarding the forward looking statements contained in this report  see the introductory paragraph to part i of this report 
we have incurred losses and may incur future losses our total revenues declined in compared to and  and we may not be able to increase our revenues 
we have never generated a quarterly operating profit  and we had an accumulated deficit as of december  of approximately million 
even if we do achieve profitability in the future  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability in the long run 
our history of losses may cause some of our potential and or actual customers to question our viability  which may in turn hamper our ability to sell some of our products or collect receivables 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could adversely affect our stock price our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely vary significantly in the future 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
our operating results have been below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in the past and could be so in the future 
our failure to meet these expectations would likely harm the market price of our common stock 
operating results vary depending on a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 

table of contents a substantial portion of our revenues for most quarters has been recorded in the last month of the quarter and the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations in operating results may not become evident until late in or towards the end of a particular quarter 
as a result  a delay in recognizing revenue  even from a single account  could seriously harm our operating results 
our expense levels are relatively fixed for a particular quarter and are based  in part  on expectations as to future revenues 
as a result  if revenue levels fall below our expectations for a particular quarter  our operating results will be adversely affected as only a small portion of our expenses vary with our revenues 
we have historically operated with little product backlog  because our products are generally delivered as orders are received 
as a result  revenue in any quarter will depend on the volume and timing of  and our ability to fill  orders received in that quarter 
we generally expect that revenues in the first and third quarters of each year will not substantially exceed  and may be lower than  revenues in the immediate prior quarter due to the annual nature of companies purchasing and budgeting cycles and the year to date structure of our sales incentive program 
to the extent that seasonality makes it more difficult to predict our revenues  the volatility of our stock price may increase 
our revenues in any quarter depend on a small number of relatively large orders our quarterly revenues are especially subject to fluctuation because they depend on the completion of relatively large license transactions 
for example  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  one transaction accounted for more than of our overall license revenues for that quarter 
this dependence on large orders makes our net revenue and operating results more likely to vary from quarter to quarter  and more difficult to predict  because the loss of any particular large order is significant 
as a result  our operating results could suffer if any large orders are delayed or canceled in any future period 
we are subject to the effects of general economic and geopolitical conditions and reductions in corporate it spending  and the current economic downturn may continue to adversely impact our business our business is subject to the effects of general economic conditions and  in particular  market conditions in the industries that we serve 
we believe that our operating results are being adversely impacted by recent unfavorable general economic and geopolitical conditions and reductions in corporate it spending 
recent political turmoil in many parts of the world  including terrorist and military actions  may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions 
our customers decisions to purchase our products are discretionary and subject to their internal budgets and purchasing processes 
in addition  since many of our customers may be suffering adverse effects from the general economic slowdown  we may find that collecting accounts receivable from existing or new customers will take longer than we expect or that some accounts receivable will become uncollectible 
if these conditions do not improve  or if they deteriorate further  our business and operating results are likely to continue to be adversely impacted 
our success depends on our desktop mobile management product family we expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our desktop mobile management product line and related services 
a decline in the price of our desktop mobile management products or our inability to increase sales of these products would seriously harm our business and operating results 
we cannot predict the success of our desktop mobile management products 
we periodically update our desktop mobile management products to make improvements and provide additional enhancements 
new versions of this product line may not provide the benefits we expect and could fail to meet customers requirements or achieve widespread market acceptance 
our strategy requires our desktop mobile management products to be highly scalable in other words  able to rapidly increase deployment size from a limited number of end users to a very large number of end users 
if we are unable to continue to achieve this level of scalability  the attractiveness of our products and services would be diminished 

table of contents we need to continue to enhance and develop our server management and embedded management product and develop new products and services there can be no assurance that the revenues from our newer products  server management and embedded management  will grow in absolute amount or as a percentage of total license revenues 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our server management products and embedded management products will meet customer expectations or gain widespread market acceptance 
to provide comprehensive software change management solutions  we will need to develop and introduce new products and services which offer functionality that we do not currently provide 
we may not be able to develop these technologies  and therefore  we may not be able to offer a comprehensive software change management solution 
in addition  we have  in the past  experienced delays in new product releases  and we may experience similar delays in the future 
if we fail to release new products on a timely basis  our business and operating results could be seriously harmed 
we depend on the growth of our customer base and increased business from our current customers our success is substantially dependent on the continued growth of our customer base 
if we fail to increase our customer base  our business and operating results would be seriously harmed 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the reliability  security  scalability and cost effectiveness of our products and services  as well as our ability to effectively market our products and services 
if we fail to generate repeat and expanded business from our current customers  our business and operating results would be seriously harmed 
many of our customers initially make a limited purchase of our products and services for pilot programs 
these customers may not choose to purchase additional licenses to expand their use of our products 
in addition  as we deploy new versions of our products or introduce new products  our current customers may not require the functionality provided by our new products and may not ultimately license these products 
our ability to grow and sustain service revenues depends on new license customers and service contract renewals because the total amount of maintenance and support fees we receive in any period depends in large part on the size and number of licenses that we have previously sold  any downturn in our software license revenues negatively impacts our future service revenues 
our license revenues decreased during  which could lead to a decrease in service revenues in and beyond 
our support and maintenance programs are sold on an annual basis 
renewal of annual support and maintenance is generally at the customer s election 
if customers elect not to renew their support and maintenance agreements  our service revenues could be significantly adversely impacted 
if support and maintenance revenues were to decline  or not grow as rapidly as expected  we would need to increase our license revenues and other service revenues in order to make up for the decline in support and maintenance revenues 
failure to further develop and sustain our indirect sales channel and third party distribution relationships could limit or prevent future growth we have a limited number of distribution relationships for our products with systems integrators and other resellers  and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships 
we are relying in part on the growth of our indirect sales channel for future revenue growth  and if this does not continue to develop  our ability to grow our revenues may be materially harmed 

table of contents our current agreements with our distribution partners typically do not prevent these companies from selling products of other companies  including products that may compete with our products  and do not generally require these companies to purchase minimum quantities of our products 
some of these relationships are governed by agreements that can be terminated by either party with little or no prior notice 
these distributors could give higher priority to the products of other companies or to their own products than they give to our products 
in addition  sales through these channels generally result in lower fees to marimba than direct sales 
the loss of  or significant reduction in  sales volume to any of our current or future distribution partners as a result of any of these or other factors could seriously harm our revenues and operating results 
we rely on third party marketing and technology relationships for future sales growth we currently have several marketing and technology relationships 
these relationships include joint sales and marketing relationships that provide us access to potential sales to large enterprises that we might not otherwise have access to  as well as product integration and other relationships 
if we cannot maintain successful marketing and technology relationships or if we fail to enter into additional marketing and technology relationships  we could have difficulty expanding the sales of our products and our growth might be limited 
our marketing and technology relationships are generally not documented in writing  or are governed by agreements that can be terminated by either party with little or no prior notice 
in addition  companies with which we have marketing or technology relationships may promote products of several different companies  including those of our competitors 
if these companies choose not to promote our products or if they develop  market or recommend applications that compete with our products  our business would be harmed 
implementation of our products by large customers may be complex and customers could become dissatisfied if implementation of our products proves difficult  costly or time consuming our products must integrate with many existing computer systems and software programs used by our customers 
integrating with many other computer systems and software programs can be complex  costly and time consuming  and can cause delays in the deployment of our products for such customers 
customers could become dissatisfied with our products if implementations prove to be difficult  costly or time consuming  and this could negatively impact our ability to sell our products 
our business and financial performance depends on our ability to retain and attract key personnel our success depends largely on the skills  experience and performance of the members of our senior management and other key personnel 
we have recently had changes in our senior management 
several members of our senior management are relatively new to marimba  and our success will depend in part on the successful assimilation and performance of these individuals 
we may not be successful in attracting qualified senior management personnel or be able to attract  assimilate and retain other key personnel in the future 
none of our senior management or other key personnel in the us is bound by an employment agreement 
in addition  our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue attracting and retaining highly skilled personnel 
like other companies in the software industry  we face competition for qualified personnel 
to compete  we believe that we must provide personnel with a competitive compensation package  including stock options 
the recent downturn in the trading price of our stock has reduced the incentive effect of many of our previously granted stock options 
if we lose senior management or key employees and are unable to replace them with qualified individuals  our business and operating results could be seriously harmed 
if requirements relating to accounting treatment for employee stock options are changed  we may be forced to change our business practices we currently account for the issuance of stock options under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
if proposals currently under consideration by administrative and governmental authorities 
table of contents are adopted  we may be required to treat the value of the stock options granted to employees as a compensation expense 
as a result  we could decide to decrease the number of employee stock options which we would grant 
this could affect our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates  and increase the cash compensation we would have to pay to them 
in addition  such a change could have a negative effect on our earnings 
we have a long sales cycle that depends upon factors outside our control a customer s decision to license our products typically involves a significant commitment of resources and is influenced by the customer s budget cycles and internal approval procedures for it purchases 
in addition  selling our products requires us to educate potential customers on our products uses and benefits 
as a result  our products have a long sales cycle  which can take over six months  and sales cycles are generally lengthening during the current economic slowdown 
we face difficulty predicting the quarter in which sales to expected customers may occur 
the sale of our products is also subject to delays from the lengthy budgeting  approval and competitive evaluation processes of our customers that typically accompany significant capital expenditures 
for example  customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to test our products before they decide whether to purchase a license for deployment 
customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by us or our competitors 
our markets are highly competitive and are experiencing consolidation  and our operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed if we are unable to compete effectively the markets for our products are highly competitive  and we expect this competition to persist and intensify in the future 
we compete against both new entrants into our markets as well as existing companies 
our failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position could seriously harm our business and operating results 
we encounter competition from a number of sources  including sellers of enterprise wide management systems  which include electronic software distribution  companies that market products that support the distribution of software applications and content  desktop software management products  application server vendors and others that have introduced software distribution capabilities into their products  and our potential customers own information technology departments and internal development efforts 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
many of these companies have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships that they could leverage  including relationships with many of our current and potential customers 
many also have significantly more established customer support and professional service organizations than we do 
in addition  these companies may adopt aggressive pricing policies which we are unable to match 
in the past  we have lost potential customers to competitors for various reasons  including lower prices 
furthermore  these companies may have greater brand name recognition that we do 
to achieve widespread market acceptance  we will need to further establish the marimba brand and be able to differentiate our product and service offerings from those of our competitors 
contributing to these challenges  our industry has been subject to consolidation  which subjects us to competition with larger companies offering integrated solutions and a wider breadth of products 
potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate additional components into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 
alliances among competitors or between competitors and other large software companies present similar competitive challenges 
as a result of consolidation or alliances  these competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 

table of contents in addition  enterprises that have already invested substantial resources in other methods of deploying and managing their applications  content and or services may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach that may replace  limit or compete with their existing systems 
protection of our intellectual property is limited we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
these legal protections afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use our proprietary information 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
to the extent that we have sufficient resources to pursue such litigation  it could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our business and operating results 
in addition  we sell our products internationally  and the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights as well as the laws of the united states 
we may be found to infringe proprietary rights of others other companies  including our competitors  may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that could prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our products 
as a result  we may be found to infringe the proprietary rights of others 
furthermore  companies in the software market are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of their proprietary rights  particularly patent rights 
we have been involved in two such patent infringement suits in the past 
we could incur substantial costs to defend any intellectual property litigation  and any such litigation could result in one or more of the following our paying monetary damages  which could be tripled if the infringement is found to have been willful  the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction requiring us to stop selling one or more of our products in their current forms  our having to redesign one or more of our products  which could be costly and time consuming and could substantially delay shipments  assuming that a redesign is feasible  our having to reimburse the holder of the infringed intellectual property for some or all of its attorneys fees and costs  our having to obtain from the holder licenses to its intellectual property  which licenses might not be made available to us on reasonable terms  or our having to indemnify our customers against any losses they may incur due to the alleged infringement 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology  our business and operating results would be significantly harmed 
we are involved in a securities class action litigation and are at risk of additional similar litigation we are a party to the securities class action litigation described in part i  item legal proceedings of this report 
the defense of this litigation may increase our expenses and divert our management s attention and resources  and an adverse outcome in this litigation could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  we may in the future be the target of other securities class action or similar litigation 
our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort over the long term  as our business grows  we may need to expand our sales and marketing efforts in order to increase market awareness of our products  market our products to a greater number of enterprises and 
table of contents generate increased revenues 
our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at senior management of our prospective customers 
new hires require extensive training and typically take at least six months to achieve full productivity 
there is no assurance that new sales representatives will ultimately become productive 
in prior quarters  our license revenues have often resulted from contracts closed by just a few sales representatives 
if we were to lose qualified and productive sales personnel  our revenues could be adversely impacted 
furthermore  the cost of hiring and training replacement sales personnel could be significant 
we need to expand our professional services we believe that growth in our product sales partly depends on our ability to provide our customers with professional services and to educate third party resellers and consultants on how to provide similar services 
as we grow  we plan to increase our services personnel to meet these needs 
however  due to the competition for qualified services personnel  we may not be able to attract  train or retain the number of highly qualified services personnel that our business needs 
our operating results and financial condition may be materially harmed if we are not successful at expanding internationally we plan to increase our international sales force and operations 
expanding internationally requires significant management attention and financial resources  and we may not grow our revenues enough to cover these expenses 
for any such expansion  we will also need to  among other things  expand our international sales channel management and support organizations and develop relationships with international service providers and additional distributors and system integrators 
in addition  as international operations become a larger part of our business  we could encounter  on average  greater difficulty with collecting accounts receivable  longer sales cycles and collection periods  greater seasonal reductions in business activity and increases in our tax rates 
furthermore  products may need to be localized  or customized to meet the needs of local users  before they can be sold in particular foreign countries 
developing localized versions of our products for foreign markets is difficult and could take longer than we anticipate 
in addition  our international business activities are subject to a variety of risks  including the adoption of or changes in laws  currency fluctuations and political and economic conditions that could restrict or eliminate our ability to do business in foreign jurisdictions 
to date  we have not adopted a hedging program to protect us from risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
export clearances  and in some cases  import clearances must be obtained before our products can be distributed internationally 
current or new government laws and regulations  or the application of existing laws and regulations  could expose us to significant liabilities  significantly slow our growth and seriously harm our business and operating results 
we rely on third party software and applications we integrate third party software and digital certificates as a component of our software 
there are inherent limitations in the use and capabilities of much of the technology that we license from third parties 
as a result  we face a number of challenges in integrating these technologies into our products 
we would be seriously harmed if the providers from whom we license software ceased to deliver and support reliable products  enhance their current products or respond to emerging industry standards 
in addition  the third party software may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the loss of  or inability to maintain or obtain this software  could result in shipment delays or reductions 
furthermore  we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future product offerings 
either alternative could seriously harm our business and operating results 
almost all of our products are written in java and require a java virtual machine in order to operate 
vendors offering these java virtual machines may not continue to make these implementations of the java virtual machines available at commercially reasonable terms or at all 
furthermore  if sun microsystems  inc were to 
table of contents make significant changes to the java language  if significant changes were to be made to java virtual machine implementations of sun microsystems  inc and other vendors or if they fail to correct defects and limitations in these products  our ability to continue to improve and ship our products could be impaired 
in the future  our customers may also require the ability to deploy our products on platforms for which technically acceptable java implementations either do not exis or are not available on commercially reasonable terms 
our customers may also use particular implementations of the java virtual machines that may not be technically or commercially acceptable for integration into our products 
software defects in our products would harm our business complex software products like ours often contain errors or defects  including errors relating to security  particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
our products extensively utilize digital certificates and other complex technology 
our use of this technology has in the past and may in the future result in product behavior problems which may not be anticipated by us or our customers 
defects or errors in our current or future products or in products comparable to ours could result in lost or delayed revenues  which would seriously harm our business and operating results 
we offer performance warranties with the purchase of a license for our software products 
such warranties typically require us to repair or replace a defective or non conforming product reported to us during the applicable warranty period  or if repairing or replacing the product is commercially impracticable  to return the license fees paid for the defective or non conforming product 
we do not currently reserve for possible products returns 
because of this  any future product returns that require us to return amounts paid to us  especially from large customers or with respect to large transactions  could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in addition  since many of our customers use our products for business critical applications  errors  defects or other performance problems could result in financial or other damage to our customers and could significantly impair their operations 
our customers could seek damages for losses related to any of these issues 
a product liability claim or warranty claim brought against us  even if not successful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend and could adversely affect our marketing efforts 
our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights and related litigation  other material litigation involving marimba  changes in our management or other key employees  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for the common stock of technology companies 
furthermore  our common stock is thinly traded  which contributes significantly to the volatility of our stock price 
due to the low trading volume of our stock  stockholders may not be able to purchase or sell shares  particularly large blocks of shares  as quickly and as inexpensively as if the trading volume were higher 
volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect its market price 
our future capital needs are uncertain we expect that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least twelve months 
however  it is possible that we could experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek financing  or at some point in the future we may otherwise seek financing to support our long term operations 
in any such event  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility 
this could seriously harm our business and operating results 

table of contents furthermore  if we issue additional equity securities  stockholders may experience dilution  and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
if we cannot raise funds  if needed  on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
we have experienced credit related issues with certain of our customers and we may not achieve anticipated revenue if we need to defer a significant amount of revenue we have experienced  in the past  credit related issues with certain of our existing and proposed customers  primarily due to the economic slowdown in the united states 
because a small number of customers account for a large portion of our revenue in any given quarter  the credit worthiness of our largest customers is critical to our cash flows 
at december   three customers represented  and of net accounts receivable  and at december   four customers represented   and of net accounts receivable 
we wrote off million in uncollectible accounts during fiscal  which had been previously reserved in should we have more customers than we anticipate with liquidity issues  or if payment is not received on a timely basis  our business  operating results and general financial condition could be seriously harmed 
we must respond to rapid technological change and evolving industry standards the markets for our software change and configuration management solutions are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
new solutions based on new technologies or new industry standards can quickly render existing solutions obsolete and unmarketable 
any delays in our ability to develop and release enhanced or new solutions could seriously harm our business and operating results 
our technology is complex  and new products  enhancements and services can require long development and testing periods 
our failure to conform to prevailing standards could have a negative effect on our business and operating results 
we face risks associated with potential acquisitions we may make acquisitions in the future 
acquisitions of companies  products or technologies entail numerous risks  including an inability to successfully assimilate acquired operations and products  diversion of management s attention  loss of key employees of acquired companies and substantial transaction costs 
some of the products acquired may require significant additional development before they can be marketed and may not generate revenue at anticipated levels 
moreover  future acquisitions by us may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the use of a substantial portion of our cash and investment balances  the incurrence of additional debt  large one time write offs and the creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges or amortization expense 
any of these problems or factors could seriously harm our business  financial condition and operating results

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since most of our investments are in marketable securities with maturities less than two years 
our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements in obligations of the us government and its agencies  investment grade state and local government obligations  securities of us corporations that  when purchased  are rated a or aa by standard and poor s or the moody s equivalent  and money market funds  deposits or notes issued or guaranteed by us and non us commercial banks meeting particular credit rating and net worth requirements with maturities of less than two years 
the following table presents the amounts of cash equivalents and investments that are subject to market risk and the weighted average interest rates  by year of expected maturity  for our investment portfolio as of december  and this table does not include money market funds  because those funds are not subject to market risk

as a result  our financial results could be affected by various factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
a portion of our sales are currently transacted in british pounds and euros  thereby potentially affecting our financial position  results of operations and cash flows due to fluctuations in exchange rates 
near term changes in exchange rates may have a material impact on our future revenues  earnings  fair values or cash flows 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions during the twelve months ended december  there can be no assurance that a sudden and significant change in the value of the british pound or euro would not seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations
