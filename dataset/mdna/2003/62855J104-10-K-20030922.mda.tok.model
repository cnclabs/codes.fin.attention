item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutic products and the development and marketing of predictive medicine products 
we employ a number of proprietary technologies that permit us to identify genes  their related proteins and the biological pathways they form 
we use this information to better understand the role proteins play in the onset and progression of human disease 
we believe that the future of medicine lies in the creation of new classes of drugs that prevent disease from occurring or progressing and that treat the cause  not just the symptoms  of disease 
in addition  we believe that advances in the emerging field of predictive medicine will improve our ability to determine which patients are subject to a greater risk of developing these diseases and who therefore should receive these new preventive medicines 
myriad researchers have made important discoveries in the fields of cancer  alzheimer s disease  viral diseases such as hiv  depression  and obesity 
these discoveries point to novel disease pathways that may pave the way for the development of new drugs 
flurizan mpc  our lead therapeutic candidate for the treatment of prostate cancer  is currently in a large  multi center human clinical trial 
we are also conducting a phase i human clinical trial for the evaluation of mpc for the treatment of alzheimer s disease 
the phase i study will evaluate the safety of mpc in healthy older volunteers and is being conducted at the mayo clinic and the university of california  san diego 
we recently initiated a phase ii human clinical study in europe and canada to assess the efficacy of mpc in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease 
we intend to independently develop and  subject to regulatory approval  market our therapeutic products  particularly in the area of cancer  viral disease  and alzheimer s disease 
we also have developed and commercialized a number of innovative predictive medicine products  including bracanalysis  which assesses a woman s risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer  colaris and colaris ap  which determine a person s risk of developing colon cancer  and melaris  which assesses a person s risk of developing malignant melanoma  a deadly form of skin cancer 
in the united states we market these products using our own person internal sales force 
we have complemented our internal sales and marketing efforts through a marketing collaboration with laboratory corporation of america holdings to sell our products to primary care physicians 
revenues from these proprietary products were million for the year ended june  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to undertaking our drug discovery and development programs  operating our predictive medicine business  and continuing our research and development efforts 
our revenues have consisted primarily of sales of predictive medicine products  research payments  upfront fees  and milestone payments 
we have yet to attain profitability and  for the year ended june   we had a net loss of million 
as of june  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses for at least the next several years  primarily due to the expansion of our drug discovery and development efforts  the initiation and continuing conduct of human clinical trials  the launch of new predictive medicine products  the continuation of our internal research and development programs  and expansion of our facilities 
additionally  we expect to incur substantial sales  marketing and other expenses in connection with building our pharmaceutical and predictive medicine businesses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies which are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and investments in privately held companies 
revenue recognition 
we apply the provisions of securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab to all our revenue transactions 
in applying the principles of sab to our research and technology licensing agreements we consider the terms and conditions of each agreement separately to arrive at a proportional performance methodology of recognizing revenue 
such methodologies involve recognizing revenue in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting and following the guidance in statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  as well as other proportional performance methodologies as considered appropriate 
percent complete is estimated based on costs incurred relative to total estimated contract costs 
we make adjustments  if necessary  to the estimates used in the percentage of completion method of accounting as work progresses and we gain experience 
our estimates of total contract costs include assumptions  such as estimated research hours to complete  materials costs  and other direct and indirect costs 
actual results may vary significantly from our estimates 
revenues related to up front payments and technology license fees when continuing involvement or research services are required of us are recognized over the period of performance 
predictive medicine revenues include revenues from the sale of predictive medicine products and related marketing agreements 
predictive medicine revenue is recognized upon completion of the test and communication of results 
up front payments related to marketing agreements are recognized ratably over the life of the agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
trade accounts receivable are comprised of amounts due from sales of our predictive medicine products 
we analyze trade accounts receivable and consider historic experience  customer creditworthiness  facts and circumstances specific to outstanding balances  and payment term changes when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in these factors could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for bad debt 
investments in privately held companies 
we review the valuation of our investments in privately held biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for possible impairment as changes in facts and circumstances indicate that impairment should be assessed 
the amount of impairment  if any  and valuation of these investments are based on our estimates and  in certain circumstances  the completion of independent  third party appraisals of the investments 
inherent in these estimates and appraisals are assumptions such as the comparability of the investee to similar publicly traded companies  the value of the investee s underlying research and development efforts  the likelihood that the investee s current research projects will result in a marketable product  and the investee s expected future cash flows 
accordingly  the amount recognized by us upon ultimate liquidation of these investments may vary significantly from the estimated fair values at june

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist of securities of various types and maturities of three years or less  with a maximum average maturity of months
