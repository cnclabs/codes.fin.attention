item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading seasonality and variability in quarterly results 
competition the air and ground courier industry is highly competitive 
airnet s primary competitor in the transportation of cancelled checks is the federal reserve s check relay network 
the actions of the federal reserve are regulated by the monetary control act  which requires the federal reserve to price its services at actual cost plus a set percentage private sector adjustment factor 
airnet believes that the purpose of the monetary control act is to curtail the possibility of predatory pricing by the federal reserve when it competes with the private sector 
no assurance beyond the remedies of law can be given that the federal reserve will comply with the monetary control act 
in the private sector  there are a large number of smaller  regional carriers that transport cancelled checks  none with a significant interstate market share 
the two largest private sector air couriers  federal express corporation fedex and united parcel service ups  both carry cancelled checks where the deadlines being pursued fit into their existing system  but this has not represented a significant market share of this industry market to date 
airnet provides customized service for our customer base  often with later pick ups and earlier deliveries than the large  national couriers provide 
both fedex and ups utilize airnet s transportation network for certain situations where they require customized service 
airnet competes with commercial airlines and numerous other carriers in its express delivery business 
airnet estimates its market share in this industry at less than 
airnet believes that this market represents a significant expansion opportunity for ultra time critical shipments requiring later pick ups or earlier deliveries than are typically provided by major integrators and freight forwarders 
airnet believes that we are in an excellent position to leverage the use of our unique air network system  our proprietary information technology and our historically high on time performance level to compete in this market 
in the passenger charter business  airnet competes with other owner operators of small business jets and charter brokers 
we believe our nationwide network of maintenance and related support facilities provides added flexibility in deploying and servicing the passenger charter aircraft fleet to meet customer demands 
environmental matters airnet believes that compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing environmental matters have not had  and are not expected to have  a material effect on airnet s capital expenditures  operations or competitive position 
employees as of december  airnet employed  persons 
airnet s employees are not represented by any union or covered by any collective bargaining agreement 
airnet has experienced no work stoppages and believes that our relationship with employees is good

 reporting on the costs of start up activities  which requires that costs related to start up activities be expensed as incurred 
prior to july   airnet capitalized start up costs associated with its premium products line of business 
effective july   airnet ceased capitalizing such costs and began amortizing the previously capitalized costs over five years 
the company adopted the provisions of the sop in its financial statements as of january  which resulted in the write off of unamortized start up costs at that time 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the continued weakness in the economy  as well as the increasing pressures on our bank revenues  require that we challenge the traditional bank airline as we know it today 
as we seek to balance our short and long term needs  we are taking steps to increase sales and profitable express growth 
we must adapt our fleet and aircraft mix to meet the demands of our growing express business while continuing to meet those of the changing bank environment 
we introduced the caravan and eliminated the aerostar from our fleet and  barring new route requirements  have targeted additional piston aircraft and our learjet s to be eliminated in we are reviewing our ground costs for efficiencies and cost reductions  and will continue this review in the security surcharge and modified fuel surcharge both had positive impacts during the fourth quarter of  and those programs will continue in the changes in our regional structure  increased marketing efforts and adaptation of our fleet are all critical to achieving our long term goals  but will impact our short term profits 
the following management s discussion and analysis describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  as well as the critical accounting policies  of airnet 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited financial statements  which include additional information about our significant accounting policies  practices and the transactions that underlie our financial results 
results of operations net revenues compared to net revenue was million in versus million in  an increase of million  or 
positive trends continued during regarding revenue growth in express services and aviation services  as reflected in their contribution to airnet s increase in total revenue 
bank services revenue declined million  or  for the year compared to weekday shipment volume was down per flying day compared to last year 
a portion of the relative lost volume is attributable to additional volume transported during the days immediately following the september th tragedies last year 
the decrease in weekday shipment volume was partially offset by a increase in weekend shipment volume  rate increases implemented in january averaging approximately  and the implementation of a security surcharge in september lower check delivery volume as a result of historically low interest rates and persistent weakness in the national economy  contributed to the reduction in revenues as did increased competitive factors and additional cost reduction initiatives by our bank customers 
express services revenue increased million  or  from to  primarily due to increased shipments of radioactive pharmaceuticals and related medical products  due to increased market penetration in select markets  and as a result of new customers utilizing airnet s transportation services to deliver cord blood to cryogenic facilities beginning in may of the increase is also partially attributable to a rate increase in february and an increase in the security surcharge in august revenue increases were achieved in all delivery service categories  with significant increases achieved in on demand cargo charter services increase over  anx services increase over  and ground only services increase over 
aviation services revenue for the twelve months ended december  was million versus million for  an increase of million 
the increase is primarily due to the addition of passenger charter services which began operations in april compared to net revenue was million in versus million in  an increase of million  or 
net revenue from bank services increased million  or  for the year compared to this increase was primarily the result of price increases  effective in january  additional volume transported in the days immediately following the september  tragedy  and a increase in weekend weight shipped 
net revenue from express services decreased million  or  from to although revenue from charter and anx hazmat increased million in over levels  primarily due to increased shipments of radioactive pharmaceuticals and related medical products  the increases were offset by revenue decreases over levels from a parts fulfillment customer totaling approximately million  primarily in the sdx services area 
mercury business services revenue increased slightly over the prior year  primarily due to a increase in shipment volume 
aviation services revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million over this increase was primarily a result of new initiatives in the passenger and on demand cargo charter product offering 
operating expenses and income from operations compared to costs and expenses increased million  or  over prior year levels  resulting in income from operations of million in compared to million in higher depreciation and an increase in aircraft lease expense as a result of the expansion of the aircraft fleet represented million and million of expense increase  respectively 
the remaining expense increase is largely attributable to an increase in hours flown 
cargo airline hours flown increased in approximately  hours versus  hours in 
passenger charter aircraft flew approximately  hours in versus approximately hours in wages and benefits increased million  or  over prior year levels 
airnet had  on average  more pilots during when compared to  a increase 
the increase in pilots was largely due to the addition of pilots in passenger charter services 
other operations staff increased in to support the growth in express volume 
aircraft fuel expense increased million  or  over prior year 
approximately million of the increase is attributable to the increase in passenger charter service volume 
the remainder of the increase is due to the increase in cargo airline hours flown and higher average fuel prices  which were not fully offset by the company s fuel surcharge programs 
the bank fuel surcharge program was modified in august to help offset timing differences between market prices and the index used for determining surcharge amounts 
during and through january  airnet s express customers paid a temporary fuel surcharge on most revenue under a separate program 
in february  airnet rescinded its fuel surcharge on express services and implemented a surcharge program using the oil price index summary columbus  ohio opis cmh index 
aircraft maintenance expense increased million  or  over levels primarily due to the increase in hours flown 
contracted air costs decreased million  or  over levels primarily due to decreased dependency on outside providers as a result of adding aircraft and pilots 
ground courier costs increased million  or  over levels primarily due to a increase in the number of express shipments excluding mercury business services  partially offset by a decrease in courier personnel 
the decrease in courier personnel is the result of airnet s strategy to better align its ground costs with shipment volumes through the use of vendors and independent contractors 
excluding the increase in aircraft lease expense discussed above  other operating costs increased million  or  over levels 
the increase is largely attributable to an increase in aircraft insurance due to the expansion of the fleet and higher premiums  increased crew training costs due to the addition of pilots and new types of aircraft to the fleet  increased workers compensation expense due to the increase in pilots and support personnel  increased rent expense due to expanded regional offices and an increase in security related costs 
excluding the non recurring charge in discussed below  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  over levels primarily due to an increase in payroll  as the result of additional staffing of the regional support and sales staffs and information technology personnel  and an increase in outside services 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  airnet eliminated amortization of goodwill  effective january  the effect of this change on results was a reduction of amortization expense of approximately  or  net of tax 
compared to in  costs and expenses increased million  or  over levels  resulting in income from operations of million in compared to million in wages and benefits increased million  or  primarily due to the addition of new pilots and new maintenance technicians over prior year levels  as well as an increase in the payout for the company wide incentive compensation program 
net fuel expense increased million primarily due to increased prices and hours flown 
maintenance expense increased million over levels primarily due to additional hours flown in support of the air system and added charter services 
the addition of pilots eliminated a shortage encountered in and allowed airnet to fully staff its nightly routes and staff on demand cargo charter aircraft 
airnet spent million less transporting packages on commercial airlines in primarily due to a change in the express revenue mix  explained above  and less commercial volume during the september  tragedies 
ground costs were down million  or  due to an decrease in courier personnel and the change in the express revenue mix as explained above 
the decrease in courier personnel is the result of airnet s strategy to better align its ground costs with shipment volumes through the use of vendors and independent contractors 
selling  general and administrative expenses were up million over levels  including approximately million in increased payroll due to the establishment of our new regional structure and the addition of sales representatives 
costs were also incurred to implement scale scanner technologies in many of our bank customer locations 
in addition  the board of directors approved a retirement agreement with gerald g 
mercer  founder and former chairman of airnet 
under the terms of the agreement  mr 
mercer retired as chairman and a director effective august  a non recurring million charge was recorded in the second quarter to cover wages and benefits associated with this agreement 
impairment charges in  airnet recorded a million  or per diluted share  non cash after tax charge in accordance with its adoption of sfas no 
a review of goodwill associated with the purchase of mercury business services  indicated that the million pretax of remaining goodwill related to this acquisition was impaired as of january   and therefore an impairment charge was recorded 
under the transition provisions of sfas no 
 this non cash charge is a cumulative effect of accounting change as of january  in  airnet recorded a non recurring million impairment charge on its investment in the check exchange system company chexs through float control  inc airnet systems  inc 
wholly owns float control  inc  which holds a interest in chexs 
float control accounts for its investment in chexs under the equity method of accounting 
during  chexs received notice that one of its customers  who accounted for a significant portion of chexs revenue  would not renew its contract with chexs beyond august as a result  the million impairment charge on investment was recorded in the second quarter 
this charge included approximately million of goodwill 
no impairment charges were recorded in interest expense interest costs were million in  million in  and million in decreased interest rates offset the effects of the million increase in debt from to  primarily to fund the purchase of aircraft in  and the effects of the million increase in debt from to  primarily to fund the million purchase of common stock from mr 
mercer pursuant to his retirement agreement in income taxes airnet recorded tax expense of million for  million for  and million for airnet s effective tax rate  excluding the effect of impairment charges  was in  for  and for including the effect of the impairment in the investment in the chexs partnership  which is not expected to have a tax benefit  the effective tax rate for was 
net income and earnings per share income prior to the non cash charge pursuant to sfas no 
was million  or per diluted share  in net income was million  or per diluted share  for the year compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year  and million  or per diluted share  in excluding the non recurring charges associated with the chexs investment write down and gerald mercer s retirement agreement  net income would have been million  or per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources airnet has historically met its working capital needs with cash flows from operations 
cash flows from operations were million for  million for  and million for under the terms of mr 
mercer s retirement agreement  airnet purchased  common shares from mr 
mercer at a total cost of million in july this privately negotiated transaction was funded through a revolving bank credit facility and airnet intends to hold these common shares in treasury 
under the terms of the agreement  mr 
mercer also had the option to sell up to  of airnet common shares each quarter to airnet based on then current market prices 
mr 
mercer exercised his option and sold  airnet common shares to airnet at a total cost of  effective january  also under the terms of his retirement agreement  mr 
mercer retained his rights to sell his remaining airnet common shares to private investors at any time in accordance with applicable laws 
on or about december   mr 
mercer sold an aggregate of  common shares to seven separate investors in privately negotiated transactions 
on december   he made a gift of  common shares to spring hill camps  which sold those common shares to three separate investors  one of which also purchased common shares from mr 
mercer  in privately negotiated transactions 
in connection with and as a condition to the investors consummating those transactions  airnet granted registration rights in respect to the  common shares collectively purchased by these investors from mr 
mercer or spring hill camps 
airnet has filed a registration statement with respect to those common shares under the securities act of  as amended  for resale on behalf of the investors 
airnet expects the registration statement to be declared effective shortly following the filing of this form k 
in february  airnet announced a stock repurchase program allowing airnet to purchase up to million of its common shares 
during  airnet purchased million in common shares funded by cash flows from operations 
there was no repurchase activity under this program in or as such  purchases of approximately million of the company s common shares may still be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
such future purchases would be considered based on current market conditions and the stock price 
following is a summary of airnet s long term capital investments in millions aircraft aircraft improvements  engines and inspections increase in prepaid engine costs other total costs of major aircraft inspections  overhauls and engine work are capitalized as incurred and depreciated based on hours flown 
the original costs of airframes are depreciated based on the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the aircraft 
aircraft maintenance costs not meeting airnet s capitalization requirements are expensed as incurred 
in  the engines of approximately in  and in of airnet s learjet aircraft are covered under manufacturer service plans msps  in which airnet prepays certain repair and overhaul costs 
these prepayments  which totaled approximately million at december  approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  are classified in fixed assets on the balance sheet 
amortization on these prepaid balances does not begin until services have been performed  at which time the prepaid balances are reclassified into depreciable asset categories and depreciated based on hours flown 
airnet intends to cover all of its lear jet engines under msp plans over the next several years as major overhauls on the non covered engines become due 
airnet anticipates it will spend between million and million in total capital expenditures in although airnet has historically financed long term capital investments through the use of internally generated cash from operations or revolving bank credit facilities  all forms of financing are considered when evaluating the resources committed for capital 
based upon such consideration  airnet entered into two five year term loans in totaling approximately million with fixed interest rates of  each secured by an aircraft  and a million term loan with a floating interest rate based upon libor  secured by two aircraft 
on january   airnet entered into operating leases for four cessna caravan aircraft each with a lease term of three years 
on september  the lease terms were extended an additional year 
on january  airnet also entered into operating leases for two cessna caravan b aircraft  one with a lease term of years and one with a lease term of years 
on april  airnet entered into an operating lease for a cessna caravan b aircraft with an initial lease term of four months 
subsequent to the initial lease term  the lease automatically extends for day incremental periods unless either party gives a day written notice 
on june  airnet entered into a cancelable operating lease for a learjet with a six month lease term 
on august  airnet entered into an operating lease for a learjet the lease term was until february  under the terms of the lease  airnet was unconditionally obligated to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease  and consummated such purchase on january  for approximately million 
airnet determined that these operating leases would provide economic benefits favorable to ownership with respect to market values  liquidity and after tax cash flows 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet  however  the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in note to the accompanying audited financial statements 
in september  airnet replaced its million revolving credit agreement 
the new credit agreement provides airnet with a three year million unsecured revolving credit facility and a five year million unsecured term loan 
the term loan requires quarterly installments of million 
the agreement bears interest at airnet s option of a fixed rate based upon libor plus a margin determined by our leverage ratio as defined in the agreement  or a floating rate based on the greater of the prime rate and the sum of 
plus the federal funds rate in effect from time to time 
the new agreement requires the maintenance of certain minimum tangible net worth and cash flow levels  imposes certain limitations on capital expenditures and the sale of assets  and restricts the amount of additional debt 
as of december   there was million unused and available under the credit agreement 
the following table sets forth airnet s contractual obligations  along with the cash payments due each period in millions payments due by period total contractual obligations long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations airnet anticipates that cash flow from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business  including anticipated capital expenditures 
there were no material capital commitments at december  other than for the purchase of the learjet discussed above 
seasonality and variability in quarterly results airnet s operations historically have been somewhat seasonal relative to holidays observed by financial institutions 
when financial institutions are closed on monday through thursday  airnet s revenue and net income are adversely affected 
airnet s fiscal quarter ending december is often the most impacted by bank holidays 
operating results are also affected by the weather 
winter weather often requires additional costs for de icing  hangar rental and other aircraft services 
airnet generally experiences higher maintenance costs during its fiscal quarter ending march selected quarterly data unaudited the following is a summary of the unaudited quarterly results of operations for the quarterly periods ended in thousands  except per share data quarters ended  march june september december net revenues income from operations income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net income loss note per share basic and diluted income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net income loss note net revenues income from operations net income loss note net income loss per share basic and diluted note note the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in in accordance with the transition provisions of this statement during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded the cumulative effect of the accounting change effective january  therefore  the unaudited quarterly results of operations for the three months ended march  have been restated as follows net earnings as previously reported cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax net earnings loss as restated earnings per share basic and diluted net earnings as previously reported cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax net earnings loss as restated note includes effects of second quarter non recurring charges totaling million  net of tax  related to million impairment in chexs investment and million charge related to gerald g 
mercer s retirement agreement see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item  respectively 
a million tax benefit was recognized on the mercer agreement and no tax benefit was recognized on the investment impairment 
excluding the effects of the two charges  income for the second quarter totaled million or per diluted share 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in many cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimates  however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
the policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies  and are material to our financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable like many companies  we experience some credit loss on our trade accounts receivable 
historically  our credit losses from bad debts have not fluctuated materially because our credit management processes have been effective 
we also recognize billing adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for certain discounts  money back service guarantees and billing corrections 
estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are regularly updated based on historical experience of bad debts  adjustments processed  and current collections trends 
allowances for these future adjustments aggregated million at december  and million at december  we consider the sensitivity and subjectivity of these estimates to be moderate  as changes in economic conditions and pricing arrangements can significantly affect the estimates used to determine the allowances 
major aircraft maintenance costs of major aircraft inspections  overhauls and engine work are capitalized as incurred and depreciated based on hours flown 
the original costs of airframes are depreciated based on the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the aircraft 
aircraft maintenance costs not meeting airnet s capitalization requirements are expensed as incurred 
the engines of approximately of airnet s learjet aircraft are covered under manufacturer service plans msps  in which airnet prepays certain repair and overhaul costs 
these prepayments  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  are classified in fixed assets on the balance sheet 
amortization on these prepaid balances does not begin until services have been performed  at which time the prepaid balances are reclassified into depreciable asset categories and depreciated based on hours flown 
airnet intends to cover all of its lear jet engines under msp plans over the next several years as major overhauls on the non covered engines become due 
self insurance accruals we are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims and benefits paid under employee health care programs 
at december  we had total self insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet of approximately million million at december  
the measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
we account for these costs primarily through measurement of claims outstanding and projected payments 
we believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis  however  changes in health costs  accident frequency and severity  and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities 
incentive compensation plans airnet maintains a company wide incentive compensation plan with payouts tied to the achievement of quarterly company earnings goals and personal departmental goals 
bonuses are calculated as a percent of base pay  depending on participation levels  which vary between management and staff levels 
we accrue for costs related to the company earnings portion of the plan based on actual quarterly results 
at december   no accrual existed for this portion of the plan  as the quarterly targets were not met 
at december   we recorded a million accrual for company earnings related goals met during the year 
we accrue for costs related to the personal departmental goals portion of the plan based on estimated achievement rates of set goals applied to individuals base pay rates 
payouts may be made quarterly or annually  depending on the nature of the goals 
at december   a million accrual was recorded for the personal departmental goals portion of the plan 
in  all personal departmental goals were paid annually  resulting in a million accrual at december  income taxes airnet accounts for income taxes under the liability method pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
impairment of goodwill and other intangibles new accounting standards adopted in require that we cease all goodwill amortization and review intangibles  including goodwill  for impairment on an annual basis 
as previously indicated  the adoption of these new rules resulted in a transition impairment of our recorded goodwill of million million net of related deferred tax asset in the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows to determine estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates 
however  once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
forward looking statements the information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including those identified by the words believe  anticipate  estimate  expect  intend  may  plan  project and similar expressions 
these forward looking statements reflect management s expectations and are based upon currently available data  however  actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ from those projected in these statements 
the following factors  in addition to those included in the disclosure under the heading risk factors below  could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements potential regulatory changes by the faa  which could increase the regulation of airnet s business  or the federal reserve  which could change the competitive environment of transporting canceled checks  adverse weather conditions  potential changes in locally and federally mandated security requirements  increases in aviation fuel costs not fully offset by airnet s fuel surcharge program  changes in check processing and shipment patterns of bank customers  acts of war and terrorist activities  the impact of a prolonged weakening u 
s 
economy on time critical shipment volumes  the acceptance of airnet s time critical service offerings within targeted express markets  technological advances and increases in the use of electronic funds transfers  and other economic  competitive and domestic and foreign governmental factors affecting airnet s markets  prices and other facets of its operations 
all forward looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements 
we assume no obligation or duty to update any of the forward looking statements included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k except to the extent required by law 
risk factors competition from other providers of express air and ground delivery services may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
airnet s bank services division competes primarily against the federal reserve s check relay network  which has significantly greater financial and other resources than airnet 
the federal reserve is regulated by the monetary control act of  which in general requires that the federal reserve price its services on an actual cost basis plus a set percentage private sector market adjustment factor 
failure by the federal reserve to comply with the monetary control act by pricing its services below the required rates could have an adverse competitive impact on airnet 
in addition  the monetary control act may be amended  modified or repealed  or new legislation affecting airnet s business may be enacted 
the market for express air and ground delivery service is highly competitive 
although major participants in the next day and second day air delivery market such as ups and fedex have also entered the business of same day and early morning delivery  they have not had a material adverse effect on airnet s business to date 
however  the efforts of these competitors could have a material adverse effect on airnet in the future 
technological changes in the check clearance and national payment systems may adversely affect the demand for airnet s bank services from the financial services industry 
some analysts have predicted that the increased use of electronic funds transfers will lead to a checkless society  which could adversely affect the demand for airnet s bank services to the financial services industry 
in addition  some financial services industry analysts have predicted the development of various forms of imaging technology that could reduce or eliminate the need for prompt delivery of cancelled checks 
similarly  technological advances in the nature of electronic mail and telefax have affected the demand for on call delivery services by express services customers 
while none of these technological advances has had a significant adverse impact on airnet s business to date  these or similar technologies  or other regulatory or technological changes in the check clearance and national payment systems  could have an adverse affect on airnet s business in the future 
the passage of the check clearing act of the st century or similar legislation could have a significant adverse effect on airnet s revenues derived from check delivery services 
the check clearing act of the st century the check act  formerly referred to as the check truncation act  represents an initiative by the federal reserve that would essentially allow for the electronification of the cancelled check and replace the need for expedited air transportation services of original cancelled checks by most of airnet s banking customers 
the check act removes the requirement of returning an original paper check to the account holder s institution and permits the use of an image replacement document created from a digital image 
airnet believes that several issues surrounding the check act will need to be addressed and resolved prior to passage by congress 
some of these issues include the current lack of specifications for the quality of check images to be created and used in the clearing process  the failure to establish standards for information systems platforms  and the failure to address the potentially negative effects that the check act could have on consumers rights 
timing for the passage of the check act is currently unknown 
however  one congressional hearing on the matter was held in september and a second is scheduled for some analysts have predicted that such legislation would be effective in and perhaps sooner 
the passage of the check act  or similar legislation  could have a significant adverse affect on airnet s revenues derived from check delivery services 
further  it is unclear when such an electronic clearing system might be implemented by banking customers and how such implementation would affect their expedited check transportation needs 
government regulation significantly affects our business 
airnet s delivery operations are subject to various federal  state and local regulations that in many instances require permits and licenses 
failure by airnet to maintain required permits or licenses  or to comply with the applicable regulations  could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct certain of our operations 
airnet s flight operations are regulated by the faa under part of the federal aviation regulations 
among other things  these regulations govern permissible flight and duty time for aviation flight crews 
the faa is currently contemplating certain changes in flight and duty time guidelines which  if adopted  could increase airnet s operating costs 
these changes  if adopted  could also require airnet and other operators regulated by the faa to hire additional flight crew personnel 
in addition  congress  from time to time  has considered various means  including excise taxes  to raise revenues directly from the airline industry to pay for air traffic control facilities and personnel 
there can be no assurances that congress will not change the current federal excise tax rate or enact new excise taxes  which could adversely affect airnet s business 
changes to current transportation security requirements or procedures could adversely impact our ability to efficiently conduct our air and ground operations to meet our current delivery parameters or significantly increase our costs to transact those operations 
considerable focus has been placed on package security requirements and procedures at domestic and international airports since the september  tragedies and related incidents 
the tsa  commercial airlines  fixed based operations where we transact a significant portion of our aircraft loading and unloading operations and airport authorities are in the process of reviewing all aspects of their security requirements 
while many proposed changes are voluntary  many are being mandated by the tsa  the dot and the faa 
during  the tsa implemented screening procedures for over the counter cargo tendered to commercial airlines 
the new screening procedures have resulted in additional tender time for packages we transport on the commercial airlines in certain locations and certain times 
in addition  the tsa continues to review and consider additional package screening requirements and changes to the vendor screening procedures  which we may need to perform on packages from our customers 
many commercial airlines are also adding security surcharges to shipments 
changes at fixed base operators and by local airport authorities could potentially limit our ramp access to our aircraft  thereby increasing tender time from customers to us 
changes in chain of custody requirements could also potentially cause us to incur additional costs to staff additional hours at certain locations 
in response to the new security related procedures being implemented  we added a security surcharge in for our bank and express services customers 
although the surcharge is expected to help offset the increasing costs associated with security issues  our current surcharge program may not be sufficient to cover all new costs we may incur as additional transportation safety procedures are developed and or required 
anti takeover provisions may delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control of airnet by a third party 
provisions of airnet s amended articles and code of regulations and of the ohio revised code  together or separately  could discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change in control of airnet and limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for the common shares 
among other things  these provisions require certain supermajority votes  establish advance notice procedures for shareholder nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders meetings  eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors and provide that directors may only be removed from office for cause 
airnet s amended articles authorize the board of directors to issue up to  preferred shares without further shareholder approval  subject to any limitations prescribed by law and the rules and regulations of the new york stock exchange 
the preferred shares could have dividend  liquidation  conversion and other rights and privileges that are superior or senior to the common shares 
issuance of preferred shares could result in the dilution of the voting power of the common shares  adversely affect holders of the common shares in the event of liquidation of airnet or delay  defer or prevent a change in control of airnet 
in addition  section of the ohio revised code contains provisions that require shareholder approval of any proposed control share acquisition of any ohio corporation at any of three ownership thresholds  and  and chapter of the ohio revised code contains provisions that restrict specified business combinations and other transactions between an ohio corporation and interested shareholders 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk airnet is exposed to certain market risks from transactions that are entered into during the normal course of business 
airnet s primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk 
at december   we had million outstanding on credit facilities subject to market rate changes in interest 
these facilities bear interest at various london interbank offering rates libors and floating rates based on prime rates and federal fund rates 
assuming borrowing levels at december   a one hundred basis point change in interest rates would impact net interest expense by approximately  per year 
in february  airnet entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a bank relative to a million term loan  with a notional amount of million and a fixed rate of plus a margin based on airnet s funded debt ratio 
at december   the aggregate fair value of the interest rate swap was approximately
