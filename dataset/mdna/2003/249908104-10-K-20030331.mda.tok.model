general overview we are a development stage company engaged in the development of pharmaceutical products based on our proprietary oral drug delivery technologies 
our primary oral drug delivery system is the patented gastric retention system 
the gr system is a tablet designed to be retained in the stomach for an extended period of time while it delivers the incorporated drug or drugs on a continuous  controlled release basis 
by incorporation into the gr system  some drugs currently taken two or three times a day may be administered only once a day 
at present  several products containing different drug compounds incorporated in the gr system are in clinical trial development 
in january  a patent on our gr system was issued  which expands the coverage of our technology for the controlled delivery of a broad range of drugs from a gastric retained polymer matrix tablet to maximize therapeutic benefits 
our intellectual property position includes six issued patents and fourteen patent applications pending in the united states 
we develop proprietary products utilizing our technology internally  as well as in collaboration with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
regarding our collaborative programs  we apply our technology to the partner s compound and from these collaborations we expect to receive research and development funding  milestone payments  license fees and royalties 
for our internal development programs  we apply our proprietary technology to existing drugs and typically fund development at least through phase ii clinical trials 
with the phase ii clinical trial results  we generally seek a collaborative partner for marketing and sales  as well as to complete the funding of the clinical trials 
we also expect to receive milestone payments  license fees and royalties from these later stage collaborations 
metformin gr we have internally developed a potential once daily metformin product for type ii diabetes  metformin gr  which is currently in pivotal phase iii human clinical trials 
our first phase iii clinical trial was completed in december the trial compared metformin gr with bristol myers immediate release metformin product currently marketed as glucophage 
metformin gr produced successful results in the trial with clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in hemoglobin ac and other measures of glycemic control 
in may  we entered into an agreement with biovail granting biovail an exclusive license in the united states and canada to manufacture and market our metformin gr 
under the agreement  we are responsible for completing the clinical development program in support of metformin gr 
the agreement provides for a million milestone payment to us upon fda approval of the product and royalties on net sales of metformin gr 
biovail has an option to reduce certain of the royalties for a one time payment to us of million 
if we do not continue to fund development costs of metformin gr  biovail has the right to assume those expenses 
in that event  our future payments from biovail under the agreement will be materially reduced 
in july  we sold  shares of our common stock to biovail at per share  for net proceeds of approximately  additionally  biovail received an option to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at per share  subject to a call provision which is triggered if the common stock price exceeds for out of consecutive trading days anytime after november  biovail also received a three year option to purchase additional shares of our common stock in an amount sufficient for biovail to hold of our common stock following exercise of the option at an exercise price initially equal to per share and increasing at per year  compounded monthly 
in january  a broad patent covering the gr system was issued 
we subsequently filed and served a complaint against bristol myers claiming that a bristol myers metformin product  glucophage xr  infringes our united states patent no 
 as well as other matters set forth in the complaint 
in november  we signed a definitive settlement agreement and release with bristol myers related to the litigation 
under the terms of the agreement  bristol myers made a one time payment of million to us 
we and bristol myers released all claims in the lawsuit against each other and granted each other a limited non exclusive royalty free license 
the license that bristol myers obtained from us extends to certain current and future compounds that bristol myers may develop internally 
ciprofloxacin gr in june  we completed a phase ii human clinical trial with an internally developed once daily formulation of the antibiotic drug ciprofloxacin  called ciprofloxacin gr  for urinary tract infections 
our formulation was compared with an immediate release ciprofloxacin hcl product that is taken twice per day and currently marketed by bayer corporation as cipro 
both treatments were comparably effective in eradication of causative organisms and resolution of clinical signs and symptoms 
in addition  patients treated with ciprofloxacin gr reported fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects compared to the patients treated with cipro 
these results were consistent with those reports in our phase i trial in we are currently in discussions with potential marketing partners for this product 
we expect to initiate phase iii clinical trials in the second quarter of if we are successful in entering into a development and licensing agreement with a marketing partner or in raising adequate financing 
furosemide gr in september  we successfully completed a phase i clinical trial of furosemide gr 
furosemide is a widely prescribed diuretic currently marketed as an immediate release formulation and sold by aventis as lasix and also sold as a generic by a number of other pharmaceutical companies 
the phase i study compared depomed s furosemide gr extended release formulation with aventis lasix 
with the gr tablet  the period of diuresis was extended with less urgency  and the total urinary volumes and the total amounts of sodium excreted were nearly identical to the immediate release product 
we are currently evaluating the design and timeline for phase ii clinical trials with furosemide gr 
we do not anticipate commencing phase ii clinical trials for furosemide gr until we have adequate funding 
other research and development activities in october  we signed an agreement with activbiotics  inc to begin feasibility studies to develop a controlled release oral tablet to deliver activbiotics broad spectrum antibiotic  rifalazil  to the stomach and upper gastrointestinal tract 
the target indication is the eradication of h 
pylori  the causative agent of most cases of ulcers 
under the agreement  activbiotics will fund our research and development expenses related to the feasibility studies with rifalazil 
in addition  we are developing other product candidates expected to benefit from incorporation into our drug delivery systems 
for example  we have completed preclinical studies of a combination product comprising our metformin gr once daily formulation of metformin with a once daily sulfonylurea for type ii diabetes 
under our agreement with biovail  biovail has an exclusive option to license this product from us 
we will begin phase i clinical trials for this product if we enter into a development and licensing agreement with biovail or another third party 
in january  we formed a joint venture with elan to develop products using drug delivery technologies and expertise of both elan and depomed 
this joint venture  depomed development  ltd 
ddl  a bermuda limited liability company  is owned by depomed and by elan 
depomed began subcontract development work for ddl in january and ddl s first product candidate successfully completed phase i clinical trials in first quarter of ddl s second product candidate  gabapentin gr  successfully completed phase i clinical trials in the first quarter of and ddl s third product candidate had been in preclinical testing 
patent applications have been filed for these products and the product rights are available to potential marketing partners for further development 
however  as a result of a major change in elan s business strategy  the development and funding of these products was stopped as of august we have had discussions with elan relating to the dissolution of ddl 
if we fail to reach mutually agreeable terms with elan regarding the dissolution of the joint venture  we will not have rights to develop these products 
in november  we reached an agreement whereby elan waived its right to terminate the technology license from elan to ddl that it had as a result of our sale of securities to biovail in july as a result of the waiver  elan no longer has the right to accelerate our payment obligation under the convertible promissory note we issued to them in january future clinical progress of our products depends primarily on the result of each ongoing study 
there can be no assurance that a clinical trial will be successful or that the product will gain regulatory approval 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of a potential product  see the sections of item entitled patents and proprietary rights  manufacturing  marketing and sales  government regulation  the section of item entitled additional factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to research and development conducted on our own behalf and through collaborations with pharmaceutical partners  our activities since inception august  have included establishing our offices and research facilities  recruiting personnel  filing patent applications  developing a business strategy and raising capital 
to date  we have received only limited revenue  all of which has been from these collaborative research and feasibility arrangements 
we intend to continue investing in the further development of our drug delivery technologies and the gr system 
we will need to make additional capital investments in laboratories and related facilities 
as additional personnel are hired in and our potential products proceed through the development process  expenses can be expected to increase from their levels 
we have generated a cumulative net loss of approximately  for the period from inception through december  of this loss   is attributable to our share of the equity in the net loss of ddl 
critical accounting policies a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to financial statements  and the impact and risks associated with our accounting policies are discussed throughout this annual report on form k and in the footnotes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgment and or estimates by management at the time that financial statements are prepared such that materially different results might have been reported if other assumptions had been made 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  use of estimates and the valuation of the exchange option of our series a preferred stock to be critical policies 
revenue recognition revenue related to collaborative research agreements with corporate partners and from ddl is recognized as the expenses are incurred for each contract 
we are required to perform research activities as specified in each respective agreement on a best efforts basis  and we are reimbursed based on the costs associated with supplies  other outsourced activities and the hours worked by employees on each specific contract 
our business strategy includes performing additional development work for our partners  which we expect will include milestone payments and license fees 
we will recognize nonrefundable milestone payments pursuant to collaborative agreements upon the achievement of specified milestones where no further obligation to perform exists under that provision of the arrangement 
license fees will be recognized over the period of continuing involvement of a specific contract or  if no continuing involvement exists  such license fees will be recognized upon receipt 
use of estimates in preparing our financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates include useful lives for fixed assets for depreciation calculations and assumptions for valuing options and warrants 
estimates in the future may include estimated lives for license agreements and the related recognition of revenue 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
valuation of exchange option of series a preferred stock we periodically monitor the redemption value of the series a preferred stock  as measured by of the fair value of the joint venture that elan would receive  less the cash payable to us  upon exchange of these securities by elan 
if and when the redemption value of the series a preferred stock exceeds its then current carrying value  we will accrete the carrying value of the series a preferred stock to the redemption value and recognize a corresponding dividend to the series a preferred shareholder 
we will recognize subsequent increases or decreases in redemption value of the series a preferred stock  however  decreases will be limited to amounts previously recorded as increases  so as not to reduce the carrying amount of the series a preferred stock below the original basis of  the determination of fair value of the joint venture requires us to make estimates and assumptions that relate  in part  to the potential success of the joint venture s ongoing research and development activities 
there is inherent risk in making such assumptions and  as a result  actual fair value may differ from such estimates of fair value 
restatement of financial information the accompanying balance sheets and statements of redeemable preferred stock and shareholders equity as of december  and have been restated to present our series a preferred stock  with a carrying amount of  outside of permanent shareholders equity  as a result of the adoption of emerging issues task force eitf topic no 
d  classification of and measurement of redeemable securities topic no 
d 
we issued the series a preferred stock in connection with the formation of ddl  our joint venture with elan corporation 
shares of the series a preferred stock are exchangeable for a portion of our investment in ddl 
the effect of this restatement is to reduce total shareholders equity by  for the periods presented 
see note of the notes to financial statements  redeemable preferred stock and shareholders equity  series a preferred stock 
net loss per common share for the years ended december  and has been restated to eliminate the dividends previously accrued on the series a preferred stock and included in the net loss applicable to common shareholders 
as the dividends are only convertible into our common stock  the amounts previously recorded as dividends represent adjustments to the conversion price that are accounted for under eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios issue no 

since the commitment date fair market value of the maximum number of common shares that could be issued pursuant to conversion of the series a preferred stock is less than the proceeds of issuance of the series a preferred stock  the series a preferred stock does not contain a beneficial conversion feature subject to recognition pursuant to issue no 
see note of the notes to financial statements  redeemable preferred stock and shareholders equity  series a preferred stock 
the statements of redeemable preferred stock and shareholders equity as of december  and have also been restated to present our series a preferred stock as issued in instead of in when such securities were originally recorded as issuable securities 
upon further analysis  we are no longer able to assert that the capital stock issuance occurred prior to december   and therefore  such amounts have been amended in the statements of redeemable preferred stock and shareholders equity to reflect the issuance of the capital stock in the year ended december  this restatement does not affect our financial position at december  or  or the statements of operations or cash flows for any of the periods presented 
the equity loss in joint venture for the year ended december  has also been restated to record  originally expensed in the year ended december  to the year ended december  these amounts represent our share of the net loss of ddl 
ddl incurred an expense of  when it acquired the license from elan to certain in process technology to be used in the development of unproven novel therapeutic products 
upon further analysis  we are no longer able to assert that all the rights and privileges were received by ddl prior to december  therefore  such amounts have been amended to reflect the associated license expenses in the year ended december  this restatement does not affect accumulated deficit at december   or see note of the notes to financial statements  collaborative arrangements and contracts  elan corporation  plc 
the effect of both the elimination of the dividends discussed above and the change in the period of recording the equity loss in the joint venture from to and the related net loss per common share follows 
the restatement to record the issuance of series a redeemable preferred stock and common stock to elan in instead of does not have an impact on the statements of operations for these periods presented 
year ended december  as previously reported equity loss in joint venture   net loss   preferred dividend   net loss applicable to common shareholders   basic and diluted net loss per common share as restated equity loss in joint venture   net loss   basic and diluted net loss per share results of operations years ended december   and revenues revenues for the years ended december   and were approximately   and  respectively 
in  revenues consisted of  earned for development work performed for ddl  our joint venture with elan  and  earned from several small collaborations with undisclosed partners and activbiotics 
we expect to perform additional development work for activbiotics in development work performed for ddl was funded by the joint venture partners at the partners pro rata ownership percentage through september  when the funding period terminated 
we do not expect to perform development work for ddl in the future 
in  revenues consisted of  earned for development work performed for ddl and  earned from a collaboration arrangement with an undisclosed partner 
in  our revenues consisted of  earned for development work performed for ddl and  earned from another small collaboration arrangement 
research and development expense research and development expense for the year ended december  was approximately  compared to approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in was due to an increase in clinical trial expense of  due primarily to two phase iii trials with metformin gr 
increased expense related to the hiring of additional employees of  also contributed to the total increase in the increase in was primarily due to expense of  for clinical trials with depomed proprietary products  including a phase iii trial with metformin gr and a phase ii trial with ciprofloxacin gr  which began in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
other increases in included  related to the hiring of additional employees and related expenses   related to increased laboratory supplies for additional projects  and  related to increased depreciation and amortization expense of additional equipment and facilities improvements 
our research and development expenses currently include costs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  outsourced clinical and other research activities  consultants  depreciation  facilities  utilities  administrative expenses and an allocation of corporate costs 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses cannot be predicted at this time for our product candidates in the early phases of research and development as it is not possible to determine the nature  timing and extent of clinical trials and studies  the fda s requirements for a particular drug and the requirements and level of participation  if any  by potential partners 
as potential products proceed through the development process  each step is typically more extensive  and therefore more expensive  than the previous step 
success in development therefore results  generally  in increasing expenditures 
furthermore  our business strategy involves licensing certain of our drug candidates to collaborative partners 
depending upon when such collaborative arrangements are executed  the amount of costs incurred solely by us will be impacted 
our largest research and development expense over the last four years has been related to the clinical trials of metformin gr 
in  for example  costs incurred in connection with metformin gr comprised approximately of our total research and development costs incurred in that year 
we expect this trend will continue in the future due to the development stage and related spending for the metformin gr clinical trials as compared to other research and development projects 
as of december  we estimate that the costs to complete the related clinical trials and studies related to metformin gr will not exceed million  including costs for internal project management and support 
as presented in the table below  we currently expect to complete the phase iii clinical trials for metformin gr by december if these trials are successfully completed  depomed will be able to file a new drug application seeking approval from the fda to market metformin gr 
since  we have incurred research and development expenses of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  related to conducting research and development activities on behalf of our joint venture  ddl 
the services performed under this arrangement relate to gabapentin gr and two undisclosed compounds selected by both partners 
we do not expect any expenses in or thereafter 
as of august   the related research activities have ceased  and no other work will be performed 
we expect that we will incur no additional associated expenses and no additional associated revenues will be recorded related to research services performed on behalf of ddl 
our research and development activities can be divided into earlier stage programs  which include analytical testing  process development  pilot scale production and preclinical testing  and later stage programs  which include clinical testing  regulatory affairs and manufacturing clinical supplies 
the costs associated with these programs approximate the following earlier stage programs    later stage programs    our research and development activities can be divided into those related to our internal projects and those related to collaborative arrangements 
the costs related to internal projects versus collaborative arrangements approximate the following internal projects    collaborative arrangements    in  and  our most advanced project  metformin gr  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total research and development costs for that year 
in each year  no other project exceeded of our total research and development costs 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives and the related stages of development for each product in development 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion date of current phase contains forward looking statements regarding timing of completion of product development phases 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see additional factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to the products listed below  we enter into feasibility studies with collaborative partners that  if successful  may be followed by definitive agreements to complete development of the product

we expect that the pharmaceutical products that we develop internally will take  on average  from four to six years to research  develop and obtain fda approval in the united states 
we generally must conduct preclinical testing on laboratory animals of new pharmaceutical products prior to commencement of clinical studies involving human beings 
these studies evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product 
we then submit the results of these studies to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application or ind which  if successful  allows the opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
typically  human clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase process in phase i  we conduct clinical trials with a small number of subjects to determine a drug s early safety profile and its blood concentration profile over time 
a phase i trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase ii  we conduct limited clinical trials with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and further evidence of safety 
a phase ii trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase iii  we conduct large scale  multi center  comparative trials with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the fda prior to commercialization of the product 
a phase iii trial for our average potential product may take to years to plan and complete 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase iii trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
we currently have one product in phase iii 
the successful development of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing 
the fda may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to patients 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage and record keeping for each product 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulation  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was approximately  compared to approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase of  in legal expense related to the lawsuit filed against bristol myers in january  which was settled in november the increase in was primarily due to expense of  related to increased patent and other legal services related to business development 
other increases in included expenses of  related to stock listing fees and  related to increased insurance limits on directors and officers insurance 
in  we expect general and administrative expense  other than legal expense  will increase moderately over levels 
equity in loss of joint venture in the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement with elan to form a joint venture 
in january  definitive agreements were signed to form our joint venture  ddl 
while we own of the outstanding capital stock and of the outstanding common stock of ddl  elan and its subsidiaries have retained significant minority investor rights that are considered participating rights as defined in the eitf consensus no 
for example  elan has of voting rights on management and research committees that approve all business plans  operating budgets and research plans 
each matter brought to the respective committee must have the approval of at least one of the elan directors 
therefore  elan has the ability to veto any matter that comes before the committees 
accordingly  we do not consolidate the financials statements of ddl  but instead account for our investment in ddl under the equity method of accounting 
separate financial statements for ddl are included elsewhere in this form k 
for the year ended december   ddl recognized a loss of  which included  in research and development expense and  in general and administrative expense 
for the year ended december   ddl recognized a loss of  which included  in research and development expense and  in general and administrative expense 
the decrease in research and development expense was due to decreased development work conducted in on behalf on ddl 
in august  all research and development work for ddl ceased 
in and thereafter  we expect ddl will recognize yearly general and administrative expense of approximately  related to legal fees until ddl is dissolved 
our equity in the loss of ddl is based on of ddl s losses since depomed owns of the ddl voting common stock  less the amounts funded by elan 
our equity in the loss of the joint venture for the year ended december  was  our equity in loss of the joint venture for the years ended december  and has been restated to record our share of ddl s  expense to acquire the elan technology rights from the year ended december  to the year ended december  our share of the ddl s loss was  and  for and  respectively 
we were responsible  at our sole discretion  for funding of ddl s cash requirements up to a maximum of  and elan was responsible  at its sole discretion  for funding of ddl s cash requirements up to a maximum of  on a quarterly basis  the elan and depomed directors of ddl reviewed and mutually agreed on the next quarter s funding of the joint venture s cash needs 
ddl does not have any fixed assets or employees and its primary focus was to conduct research and development for potential products using intellectual property of elan and depomed 
elan made available to us a convertible loan facility to assist us in funding our portion of the joint venture losses up to a maximum of  the funding period for research and development as well as the funding period of the loan facility terminated september we have been seeking elan s agreement to dissolve the joint venture 
in and thereafter  we expect our share of ddl s yearly loss will be approximately  until ddl is dissolved 
as our funding of ddl equals our equity in the net loss of ddl  we had no carrying value in the ddl investment as of december   and interest expense net interest expense was approximately  for the year ended december  compared to net interest expense of approximately  for the year ended december  and net interest income of  for the year ended december  in  interest income decreased to  from  and  in and  respectively 
the decrease was due to declining cash and investment balances and declining interest rates 
in  the interest expense accrued on the elan convertible loan facility increased to  from  and  in and  respectively 
interest expense on long term debt and capital leases increased to  in from  and  in and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense from year to year was due to increasing debt balances on the elan convertible loan facility and the equipment loans see note of the notes to financial statements 
net interest income also includes immaterial gains realized on the sale of some of our marketable securities 
gain from bristol myers legal settlement in january  we filed  and later served  a complaint against bristol myers in the united states district court for the northern district of california for infringement of us patent no 
 in november  we signed a definitive settlement agreement and release with bristol myers related to the litigation 
under the terms of the agreement  bristol myers made a one time payment of million to us 
we and bristol myers released all claims in the lawsuit against each other and granted each other a limited non exclusive royalty free license 
the license that bristol myers obtained from us extends to certain current and future compounds that bristol myers may develop internally 
series a preferred stock dividend in january  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock at a price of  per share to fund our share of the initial capitalization of ddl 
the series a preferred stock accrues a dividend of per annum  compounded semi annually and payable in shares of series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock dividends are convertible at anytime after january into our common stock 
the original conversion price of the series a preferred stock was  however  as a result of our march financing  the conversion price has been adjusted to per share 
as the dividends are only convertible into our common shares  the amounts previously recorded as the dividends represent adjustments to the conversion price that are accounted for under eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios 
since the commitment date fair market value of the maximum number of common shares that could be issued pursuant to conversion of the series a preferred stock is less than the proceeds of issuance of the series a preferred stock  the series a preferred stock does not contain a beneficial conversion feature subject to recognition pursuant to issue no 
stock option grants in december  the board of directors authorized an increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance under our stock option plan the plan by  shares 
this increase will be submitted for shareholder approval at our annual meeting of shareholders the annual meeting  which is scheduled for may  in december and march  the board of directors granted options to purchase approximately  shares out of the proposed  share increase of common stock at exercise prices of and  respectively  which represented the fair market value of our common stock on the dates of grant 
however  as the options will not be deemed authorized for grant until the shareholders have approved the increase in the number of shares authorized under the plan  the applicable measurement date for accounting purposes will be the date such approval is obtained 
accordingly  if the fair market value of our common stock is greater than the exercise price on the approval date  we will be required to recognize the difference as a non cash compensation expense to be recognized over the vesting period of the related stock options 
if the fair market value of our common stock is significantly higher than the exercise price on this date  our future operating results could be materially impacted 
the fair market value of our common stock at december  and march  was and  respectively 
also in december  the board of directors adopted the nonstatutory stock option plan the plan 
the plan allows for the grant of up to  nonstatutory stock options 
options may be granted under the plan only if our shareholders fail to approve the  share increase in the plan at the annual meeting 
if our shareholders approve the increase in the plan at the annual meeting  the plan will terminate and no options will be granted thereunder 
net operating losses we have not generated any taxable income to date 
at december   the net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for federal income tax purposes were approximately  future utilization of carryforwards may be limited in any fiscal year pursuant to internal revenue code regulations 
the carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
as a result of the annual limitation  anticipated and future losses or changes in ownership of the company  all or a portion of these carryforwards may expire before becoming available to reduce our federal income tax liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities cash used in operations in the year ended december  was approximately  compared to approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in and  the change in cash used in operations was due primarily to the net loss offset by our share of the loss of the joint venture and increases in accounts payable due to increased clinical trials activity 
during the year ended december   the change in cash used in operations was due primarily to our net loss offset by our share of the net loss of the joint venture 
investing activities cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  totaled approximately  and consisted of an increase in marketable securities of  and approximately  related to the investment in our joint venture and  related to purchases of lab equipment  furniture and computers 
marketable securities were increased in after we received the  payment from bristol myers related to the settlement of our patent infringement lawsuit in november cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  totaled approximately  and consisted of approximately  related to the investment in our joint venture and  related to purchases of lab equipment  leasehold improvements  furniture and computers  which were offset by a net decrease in marketable securities of  cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  totaled approximately  and consisted of approximately  related to the investment in our joint venture and  related to leasehold improvement expenditures and the purchase of lab equipment  which were partially offset by a net decrease in marketable securities of  we expect that future capital expenditures may include additional product development and quality control laboratory equipment as we work towards implementation of current good manufacturing practices cgmp in our laboratories  as well as additional leasehold improvements 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  and consisted primarily of net proceeds of  received in march and  received in july in private placements of common stock see note of the notes to financial statements  redeemable preferred stock and shareholders equity  private placements 
proceeds of  were received on the convertible loan facility provided by elan to fund our share of ddl s expenses see note of the notes to financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
proceeds received were offset by  in payments on the equipment loans and capital lease obligations 
cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was  and consisted primarily of net proceeds of  received in june in a private placement of a combination of common stock and warrants 
proceeds of  were received on the convertible loan facility provided by elan and  was received on our equipment loan facility 
proceeds from financing activities were offset by  in payments on the equipment loan and capital lease obligations 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  and consisted primarily of proceeds received in private placements of common stock and warrants and preferred stock 
in january  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock  sold to elan at a price of per share  with net proceeds of approximately  also in january  we sold  shares of convertible preferred stock to elan for  per share  and these proceeds were used for the initial capitalization of ddl 
additionally  proceeds of  were received on the loan facility provided by elan 
in november  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock and  warrants for net proceeds of  proceeds received were offset by  in payments on equipment loans and capital leases 
series a preferred stock in january  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock to elan to fund our share of the initial capitalization of ddl 
at elan s option  the series a preferred stock is convertible into depomed s common stock or may be exchanged for a interest in ddl 
in july  the eitf issued eitf topic no 
d  classification and measurement of redeemable securities 
topic no 
d clarifies rule of regulation s x and requires preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside of permanent equity if the redemption of the securities is outside of the issuer s control 
the exchange feature of our series a preferred stock makes the stock subject to reclassification under topic no 
d accordingly  we classified our series a preferred stock  in the amount of  outside of shareholders equity  which has resulted in a  increase in our net capital deficiency 
if elan elects to exchange the series a preferred stock for a interest in ddl  elan would also be required to reimburse depomed for of ddl s historical losses  excluding the technology license 
however  we have had discussions with elan relating to the dissolution of ddl 
elan has indicated that it may be in a position to convert the series a preferred stock into common stock in if elan elects to convert the series a preferred stock into our common stock   will be reclassified to permanent equity 
contractual obligations as of december  and  there was  and  outstanding related to the loan facility provided by elan 
the outstanding amounts include accrued interest of  and  at december  and  respectively 
the funding term of the loan expired on september  the loan and accrued interest are payable in january in cash or our common stock  at elan s option 
through december   we have invested approximately  in equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements  of which approximately  was financed through long term debt equipment financing arrangements 
as of december   the borrowing terms of the financing arrangements have expired 
if we do not obtain additional credit arrangements  we will need to spend our own resources for future equipment purchases 
as of december   our aggregate contractual obligations are as follows operating leases capital leases long term debt year ending december  as of december   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  working capital of  and accumulated net losses of  we expect to continue to incur operating losses over the next several years 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will permit us to meet our capital and operational requirements through at least december  we base this expectation on our current operating plan  which anticipates that we will raise at least million through the sale of our equity securities or from development and licensing arrangements 
we will take steps to revise our current operating plan if we are not successful in raising such funds 
our current operating plan may change as a result of many factors 
our cash needs may also vary materially from our current expectations because of numerous factors  including results of research and development  results of license negotiations  relationships with collaborative partners  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  technological advances  and results of clinical testing  requirements of the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies 
we will need substantial funds of our own or from third parties to conduct research and development programs  conduct preclinical and clinical testing  and manufacture or have manufactured and market or have marketed potential products using the gr system 
our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to fund our operations until such time as we may be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our operations 
we have limited credit facilities and no other committed source of capital 
to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue our development programs 
we may not be able to raise such additional capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if the company raises additional capital by selling its equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our shareholders equity positions 
if adequate funds are not available the company may have to delay  postpone or terminate clinical trials  curtail other operations significantly  and or obtain funds through entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
the inability to raise capital would have a material adverse effect on the company 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial reporting standards fas no 
on business combinations and fas no 
on goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas no 
is effective for any business combinations initiated after june  and also includes the criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
fas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will require that goodwill not be amortized  but rather be subject to an impairment test at least annually 
separately identified and recognized intangible assets resulting from business combinations completed before july  will be reassessed and the remaining amortization periods adjusted accordingly 
the adoption of fas nos 
and on january   had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
fas no 
supersedes fas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the primary objectives of fas no 
are to develop one accounting model based on the framework established in fas no 
for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  and to address significant implementation issues 
our adoption of fas no 
on january  did not have an impact on our financial position and results of operations 
on june   the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
fas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
fas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of fas no 
is not expected to have an impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
fas no 
amends fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  fas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of fas no 
to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the additional disclosure requirements of fas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
or apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for employee stock options 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including residual value guarantees issued in conjunction with operating lease agreements 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  our adoption of fin did not have an impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structures used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
our adoption of fin did not have an impact on our results of operations and financial position 
additional factors that may affect future results in addition to other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company 
we believe the following risks along with the risks described elsewhere in this form k  are the material risks we face at the present time 
if any of the risks or uncertainties described in this form k actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business 
we will need additional capital to support our operations  which may be unavailable or costly 
as of december   our capital resources consist of approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will permit us to meet our capital and operational requirements through at least december we base this expectation on our current operating plan  which anticipates that we will raise at least million through the sale of our equity securities or from development and licensing arrangements 
we will take steps to revise our current operating plan if we are not successful in raising such funds 
our current operating plan may change as a result of many factors  including the following greater than expected clinical development costs associated with our exclusive license with biovail described below under we are dependent on biovail for future payments related to the development of metformin gr 
changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs that could result in costly additional research and delay the eventual sale of our products 
results of clinical testing and the regulatory requirements of the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies that may lead to cash outlays greater than expected 
results of our product licensing activities 
further  our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to fund our operations until such time as we may be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our operations 
to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue our development programs 
we may not be able to raise such additional capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional capital by selling our equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in significant dilution of our shareholders equity positions  especially if we are required to sell securities at the currently low trading price of our common stock 
if adequate funds are not available  we may have to curtail operations significantly  or obtain funds through entering into collaboration agreements or settlements on unattractive terms 
we are at an early stage of development and are expecting operating losses in the future 
to date  we have had no revenues from product sales and only minimal revenues from our collaborative research and development arrangements and feasibility studies 
for the years ended december   and  we had total revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and we incurred losses of million  million and million  respectively 
as we continue to expand our research and development efforts  we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years 
therefore  we expect our cumulative losses to increase 
we are dependent on biovail for future payments related to development of metformin gr 
in may  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with biovail to manufacture and market metformin gr  our most advanced product candidate  in the united states and canada 
we are responsible for completing the clinical development of metformin gr 
biovail will not reimburse us for any of our expenses incurred in connection with the clinical development of metformin gr 
as of december   we expect the total remaining amount of development costs for metformin gr will not exceed million 
we will not receive any payments from biovail until the fda approves metformin gr for marketing in the united states  which we do not expect to occur prior to the fourth quarter of  if at all 
only upon fda approval of metformin gr will biovail be required to make a million payment to us 
if we do not continue funding development costs of metformin gr  biovail would have the right to assume development of metformin gr 
in that event  our future payments from biovail would be materially reduced 
most of our revenues were derived from our relationship with elan  which we expect to be terminated 
we have generated all of our revenues through collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
in january  we formed a joint venture with elan to develop products using drug delivery technologies and expertise of both elan and depomed 
for the years ended december   and   and of our total revenues  respectively  were derived from our joint venture with elan 
in august  work on the joint venture s research and development programs ceased and we are seeking elan s agreement to dissolve the joint venture 
we do not expect to generate any future revenue from the joint venture  nor can we be certain of when it will be dissolved or of the terms of its dissolution 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and affect our stock price 
the following factors will affect our quarterly operating results and may result in a material adverse effect on our stock price variations in revenues obtained from collaborative agreements  including milestone payments  royalties  license fees and other contract revenues  success or failure of the company in entering into further collaborative relationships  decisions by collaborative partners to proceed or not to proceed with subsequent phases of the relationship or program  the timing of any future product introductions by us or our collaborative partners  market acceptance of the gr system  regulatory actions  adoption of new technologies  the introduction of new products by our competitors  manufacturing costs and capabilities  changes in government funding  and third party reimbursement policies 
our collaborative agreements may give rise to disputes over ownership of our intellectual property and may adversely affect the commercial success of our products 
our strategy to continue development and commercialization of products using the gr system requires that we enter into additional collaborative arrangements 
collaborative agreements are generally complex and contain provisions which may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights and obligations of the parties 
such disputes can delay collaborative research  development or commercialization of potential products  or can lead to lengthy  expensive litigation or arbitration 
in addition  the terms of collaborative partner agreements may limit or preclude us from developing products or technologies developed pursuant to such agreements 
moreover  collaborative agreements often take considerably longer to conclude than the parties initially anticipate  which could cause us to agree to less favorable agreement terms that delay or defer recovery of our development costs and reduce the funding available to support key programs 
we may not be able to enter into future collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms  which would harm our ability to commercialize our products 
further  even if we do enter into collaboration arrangements  it is possible that our collaborative partners may not choose to develop and make commercial sales of products using the gr system technologies 
other factors relating to collaborations that may adversely affect the commercial success of our products include any parallel development by a collaborative partner of competitive technologies or products  arrangement with collaborative partners that limit or preclude us from developing products or technologies  premature termination of a collaboration agreement  or failure by a collaborative partner to devote sufficient resources to the development and commercial sales of products using the gr system 
our current and any future collaborative partners may pursue existing or other development stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us 
our collaborative partners may also terminate partnerships or otherwise decide not to proceed with development of our products 
for example  one of our undisclosed collaborative partners recently elected to suspend indefinitely further development of a potential product we had developed for that partner 
it is difficult to develop a successful product 
if we do not develop a successful product we will not be able to raise additional funds 
the drug development process is costly  time consuming and subject to unpredictable delays and failures 
before we or others make commercial sales of products using the gr system  we  our current and any future collaborative partners will need to conduct clinical tests showing that these products are safe and effective  and obtain regulatory approval from the fda and foreign regulatory authorities 
we will have to curtail  redirect or eliminate our product development programs if we or our collaborative partners find that the gr system prove to have unintended or undesirable side effects  or products which appear promising in preclinical studies do not demonstrate efficacy in larger scale clinical trials 
even if our products obtain regulatory approval  successful commercialization would require market acceptance  cost effective commercial scale production  and reimbursement under private and governmental health plans 
any material delay or failure in the development and commercialization of our potential products  particularly metformin gr or ciprofloxacin gr  would adversely impact our financial position and liquidity and would make it difficult for us to raise financing on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approval  we will be limited in our ability to commercialize our products  and our business will be harmed 
our lead product candidate  metformin gr  is currently in pivotal phase iii human clinical trials 
we intend to file a new drug application with the fda for metformin gr sometime after completion of phase iii human clinical trials  which is expected in the fourth quarter of however  we do not expect to be able to obtain fda approval to market metformin gr prior to the fourth quarter of in june  we completed a phase ii human clinical trial with an internally developed once daily formulation of the antibiotic drug ciprofloxacin  for urinary tract infection 
if we are successful in entering into a development and licensing agreement related to ciprofloxacin gr with a marketing partner  or in raising adequate financing  we are planning to initiate phase iii clinical trials for this product in the second quarter of the regulatory process is expensive and time consuming 
even after investing significant time and expenditure on clinical trials  we may not obtain regulatory approval of our products 
data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
in addition  changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review of each submitted new application may cause delays or rejections 
even if we receive regulatory approval  this approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which we can market a product 
further  once regulatory approval is obtained  a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review 
the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product  manufacturer or manufacturing facility  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
manufacturers of approved products are also subject to ongoing regulation  including compliance with fda regulations governing current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp 
failure to comply with manufacturing regulations can result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
if we are unable to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for our products from third party payors  we will be unable to generate significant revenues 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our product candidates will depend in part on the availability from third party payors such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefit management companies  and other healthcare related organizations 
if reimbursement is not available for our product candidates  demand for these products may be limited 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products  including pharmaceuticals 
our product candidates may not be considered cost effective  and adequate third party reimbursement may be unavailable to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a return on our investment 
federal and state governments in the united states and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare 
existing regulations affecting pricing may also change before any of our product candidates are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product we may develop in the future 
business interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business 
our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses  human error  natural disasters  telecommunications failures  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
in particular  our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area  which is known for seismic activity 
we have not established a formal disaster recovery plan  and our back up operations and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that occur 
a significant business interruption could result in losses or damages incurred by us and require us to cease or curtail our operations 
if we cannot meet the american stock exchange s requirements for continued listing  the american stock exchange may delist our common stock  which would negatively impact the price of our common stock and our ability to sell our common stock 
our common stock is listed on the american stock exchange  or amex 
the amex rules provide that the amex will consider delisting when a company has  among other things  a sustained losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years and has shareholders equity of less than  and b sustained losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years and has shareholders equity of less than  in june  the amex notified us that we did not satisfy these criteria and agreed to continue our listing if we submitted an acceptable plan to regain compliance with the amex continued listing standards by january in july  we submitted our plan  which the amex approved in september since we submitted our plan  we have decreased our shareholders deficit as set forth in the plan 
however  we still do not meet the amex s minimum shareholders equity criterion 
the amex will continue to monitor our progress towards achieving the goals set forth in the plan and may institute delisting proceedings if we fail to make progress consistent with the terms of the approved plan 
if we are delisted  it would be far more difficult for our shareholders to trade in our securities and more difficult to obtain accurate  current information concerning market prices for our securities 
the possibility that our securities may be delisted may also adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing 
if our common stock is delisted from the american stock exchange  we may be subject to the risks relating to penny stocks 
a penny stock is defined generally as any non exchange listed equity security that has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
as of march  our common stock was trading at 
if our common stock were to be delisted from trading on the amex and the trading price of the common stock were to fall below per share on or after the date the common stock was delisted  trading in such securities would also be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these rules require additional disclosure by broker dealers in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock and impose various sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors  generally institutions 
the additional burdens imposed upon broker dealers by such requirements may discourage broker dealers from effecting transactions in our securities  which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of such securities and the ability of purchasers to sell our securities in the secondary market 
our advisors may have conflicting obligations to other entities that could result in intellectual property disputes between us and those entities 
two groups the policy advisory board and development advisory board advise us on business and scientific issues and future opportunities 
certain members of our policy advisory board and development advisory board work full time for academic or research institutions 
others act as consultants to other companies 
in addition  except for work performed specifically for us and at our direction  any inventions or processes discovered by such persons will be their own intellectual property or that of their institutions or other companies 
further  invention assignment agreements signed by such persons in connection with their relationships with us may be subject to the rights of their primary employers or other third parties with whom they have consulting relationships 
if we desire access to inventions that are not our property  we will have to obtain licenses to such inventions from these institutions or companies 
we may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our operating results have not been sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in short term debt instruments 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities would not change by a significant amount 
foreign currency fluctuations we have not had any significant transactions in foreign currencies  nor did we have any balances that were due or payable in foreign currencies at december  therefore  a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have an impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we do not hedge any of our foreign currency exposure
