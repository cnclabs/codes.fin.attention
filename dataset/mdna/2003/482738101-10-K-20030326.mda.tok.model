as you read management s discussion and analysis  please refer to our consolidated statements of operations on page  which presents the results of our operations for   and the following discussion should be read with an understanding of the risk factors on pages through  which describe events that could influence our forward looking projections 
during the period covered by this discussion  we invested heavily in research and development for low profile satellite antennas  fog technology  and photonic fiber optical components 
over the past two years we accelerated our project development schedule  which resulted in significant operating losses in and we forecast that levels of r d spending will be flat to down slightly compared to  as we reduce our dependence upon outside research consultants 
we anticipate the initial product availability of the low profile antenna will be at the end of the second quarter of we slowed our investment in the development of our in fiber  optical components in response to the dramatic slow down in the telecommunications market 
we are currently redirecting the funding of in fiber component research towards high performance  low cost gyroscopes  which have a potentially shorter range financial return 
going forward  we plan to continue basic research into in fiber telecommunications components  but plan to align the timing of our development expenditures with opportunities in the telecommunication market as they emerge 
since october  we have made substantial investments in fiber optic gyro technology 
fog sensors increase the accuracy and durability of our existing products  thus broadening our market spectrum 
our investment has resulted in a suite of open loop fiber optic gyro sensors  a vertically integrated fiber optic manufacturing process and the integration of fog sensors into our defense navigation product lines 
we sold modest quantities of fogs in  and subsequently increased our sales volumes as we improved our product designs 
as with other research initiatives  we believe that the market opportunities associated with fog based products will contribute to kvh s growth and help kvh sustain profitable operations 
our strategic emphasis will be to integrate fiber optic products into systems level solutions  including our tactical navigation and antenna systems  and into new applications such as guided munitions and high voltage current sensors 
concurrent with the investments in new products and markets  we strengthened our corporate infrastructure to support the company s growth 
we became iso certified in  implemented a company wide enterprise resource planning computer system and supply chain management computer system  began a manufacturing outsourcing program  installed redundant computer processing at an outside location to provide disaster recovery capability for our computer systems and hired key personnel in operations  finance  engineering and business development to improve the execution of our growth plan 
we believe that our investments in both product research and corporate infrastructure help prepare us for controlled growth and profitability 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data expressed as a percentage of revenues year ended december  net sales gross profit research and development sales and marketing general and administrative operating loss other expense income  net loss income before income tax benefit income tax benefit net loss years ended december  and net sales net sales increased by to million from million in communications product revenues made up over half of this growth  increasing to million from million in communications growth reflects the expansion of sales of land mobile products through large national distributors and significant original equipment manufacturer sales volumes resulting from new agreements with major rv distributors and manufacturers 
based upon our expanded distribution channels  we believe that communications sales will continue to grow  but at a lower rate than in factors that could influence sales are continued growth in the overall rv market  the potential for significant oem sales  and the release of our low profile antenna  which we believe will broaden our market to include sport utility vehicles and mini vans 
we have little experience in the automotive marketplace and it is difficult to predict sales results with certainty  however this market appears to be a significant sales opportunity 
the risk factors section beginning on page highlights additional details and risks related to product development cycles and other risks associated with the communications market 
combined sales for our defense navigation  fog components  legacy marine and oem products increased in to million from million in defense navigation shipments including funded engineering increased to million from million in  fog components excluding defense shipments declined to million from million in  and legacy marine and oem sensor shipments declined in to million from million in the growth in defense revenues is due to the demand for tactical military navigation systems  such as our tacnav light system  which is currently deployed on fast attack  light armored vehicles worldwide 
in addition  an increased percentage of our defense systems sales include fiber optic components  providing an even greater level of precision 
the decline in fog component sales reflects the unevenness of non recurring orders year to year  while the planned decline in marine legacy and oem orders resulted from a marketing shift away from the consumer marine navigation market towards higher volume sales opportunities in the communications and defense markets 
overall  we anticipate that the rate of combined sales growth in may slow somewhat from our current sales forecast indicates the potential for strong growth  however  factors such as a delay in introduction or slow acceptance of our low profile antenna  a prolonged economic downturn or delays within the military procurement process could cause our actual sales results to differ materially from our current forecast 
cost of goods sold the company s cost of goods sold consists of direct labor  materials  manufacturing overheads and engineering costs associated with customer funded engineering 
customer funded research and development costs included in cost of goods sold were approximately million in and million in during we realized material and labor cost savings equal to of sales 
cost improvements resulted from reduced component costs  outsourcing of sub assemblies and improvements in our manufacturing methods 
our supply chain and materials requirements planning systems continued to provide us with stronger control over our manufacturing inventories  resulting in favorable material purchase agreements  improved component pricing and increased inventory turns  which rose to turns from inventory turns during the previous year 
manufacturing overhead spending decreased slightly from the prior year and overhead spending declined as a percentage of sales to in from in improved manufacturing spending reflects favorable overhead spending and improved capacity utilization at both of our manufacturing facilities 
our largest productivity gain occurred at our rhode island manufacturing facility  where overhead spending grew modestly  while production rose by in from levels 
looking ahead we believe that  primarily due to shifts in production mix  cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will remain essentially unchanged from research and development expense research and development expense consists of direct labor  materials  associated overheads  and other direct costs resulting from the company s internally funded product development activities 
all internal research and development costs are expensed in the period they are incurred 
internally funded development costs associated with the low profile antenna and active fiber projects for each of and represented approximately of total r d spending in and we made significant progress in the development of our low profile antenna in and introduced the product in january of telecommunications market conditions forced us to dramatically slow our active fiber high speed modulator project 
other r d expense increased million as a result of decreased customer funding and new hires 
spending associated with outside consultants is expected to decline as we release our low profile antenna in sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions for in house and third party sales representatives  travel expenses  sales literature  advertising  and trade shows 
sales and marketing expense increased by million to million in from million in  while spending as a percentage of revenues declined to of sales in from of sales in the majority of the cost increase was related to variable selling expenses such as third party sales commissions  trade show costs  media  and the expense of new product introductions 
kvh utilizes a third party distribution network  which provides significant leverage of our in house resources with a minimum of corporate support 
third party distribution allows kvh to grow quickly without incurring the additional costs of hiring and training in house sales personnel and leverages third party sales resources and their geographic market presence 
in we also entered into oem agreements with leading rv coach manufacturers that allowed us to leverage their sales volumes to increase our product sales 
oem customers provide significant sales volume potential  and require a proportionately smaller investment in sales support costs per dollar of revenue than lower volume customers 
looking ahead we believe marketing and sales costs will increase primarily as a result of new product introduction costs  but we anticipate that  as a percentage of sales  selling expenses will not change materially compared to general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists of costs attributable to the company s management  finance  accounting  management information systems  human resources  facility management  and outside professional services 
general and administrative costs increased million to million or from levels  but decreased slightly as a percentage of sales to from in cost increases reflect annual salary increases  key hires  and rising professional fees resulting from compliance with new regulations contained in the sarbanes oxley act  and professional fees associated with general law support for patent filings  contracts and other legal matters 
going forward  we anticipate that general and administrative costs will increase  but remain roughly equal to levels when expressed as a percentage of sales 
interest income interest income reflects the interest earned by investing excess cash in fully insured  federal short term obligations 
interest expense interest expense is made up of interest charges related to our mortgage loan and the commitment fee associated with the unused portion of our asset based line of credit 
income tax benefit income tax expense of  in represents both income tax on income generated by our foreign subsidiary and domestic income tax expense from further adjustment of cumulative domestic income tax benefit 
the total income tax benefit resulting from domestic losses for the year ended december  was allocated to income from continuing operations and stockholders equity  eg  from current year disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options and exercise of non qualified stock options  but was fully reserved with a valuation allowance 
for a further discussion of income taxes see note to the financial statements 
years ended december  and net sales net sales increased by to approximately million from roughly million in communications product revenues made up of our sales growth  increasing by to million from million in the slowdown of communications sales growth was triggered by increases in fuel prices and economic uncertainties that had a negative impact on rv sales  which is one of the largest applications for our land mobile communications products 
towards the end of gasoline prices fell  and the rv market began to recover its strength  stimulating renewed sales growth 
we steadily grew our reseller distribution network during  entering into agreements with major rv distributors and manufacturers  positioning kvh for renewed growth in defense navigation  fog components  legacy marine and oem product sales increased in to million from million in this sales increase was the result of three factors defense shipments declined by million from million in  fiber optic revenues grew to million from million in  and oem shipments doubled in to million from million in then current events created a significant demand for tactical navigation systems  such as our tacnav light system  which is deployed on light armored vehicles 
although our defense shipments declined in  we were able to demonstrate our products to a wide range of defense customers and put a record number of quotations in our customers hands 
as a result of these efforts our tacnav products won wide acceptance within the us military and allied military circles cost of goods sold customer funded research and development costs included in cost of goods sold were approximately million in and million in during we realized material and labor cost savings resulting from the redesign of existing products and improvements in our manufacturing process 
our supply chain materials management system continued to provide us with stronger control over our manufacturing inventories and provided the tools required to better manage our procurement process 
this resulted in more favorable material purchase agreements and better pricing 
manufacturing overheads decreased by in and overheads fell as a percentage of sales to from in the prior year 
improved manufacturing overheads reflect increased fog capacity utilization and better management of our rhode island manufacturing resources 
research and development expense internally funded development costs increased by approximately million or in from million in the cost increase is the result of the acceleration of two development projects  a high speed in fiber modulator and a low profile satellite antenna 
all internal research and development costs are expensed in the period they are incurred 
the combined costs of the two projects amounted to million dollars in non project r d decreased slightly as a result of increased customer funding of defense programs in almost one third of r d spending reflects the use of outside consultants and university researchers to support our project developments 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense increased by million to million in from million in the majority of the cost increase was related to variable selling expenses such as commissions  trade shows  media  and new product introductions 
in addition  roughly of the increase related to the reorganization of the post sales customer support group into a new customer service team that provides comprehensive support to the customer  including order placement  product shipment  repair service  and a customer help desk 
we broadened our product offerings to include high speed broadband internet capabilities  and we began the process of staffing that function 
products requiring hour a day  day a week customer support will continue to have a significant impact on support cost 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists of costs attributable to the company s management  finance  accounting  management information systems  human resources  facility management  and outside professional services 
general and administrative costs increased million to million or in over and increased slightly as a percentage of sales to from in cost increases reflect annual salary increases  and rising professional fees 
interest income interest income reflects the interest earned by investing excess cash from our private offering in fully insured  federal short term obligations 
interest expense interest expense is made up of interest charges related to our mortgage loan and equipment leases 
income tax benefit total income tax benefit for the year ended december  was allocated to income from continuing operations and stockholders equity  but was fully reserved with a valuation allowance and therefore zero income tax benefit was accounted for in our statement of operations  or additional paid in capital for stock based compensation income tax benefits eg  from current year disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options and exercise of non qualified stock options 
in  as a consequence of an internal revenue service tax return examination  we made adjustments to income tax credits recorded in prior years 
for a further discussion of income taxes see note to the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities decreased by million in to million from million in the improvement included the impact of a decrease in the net loss of million  an increase in short term liabilities  which was partially offset by increased accounts receivable of million 
a key success factor in preserving operating cash was our control of manufacturing inventory  which decreased by million  while sales grew by over results 
capital spending declined year over year by million  as we were selective in making capital acquisitions 
cash generated from financing activities declined by million reflecting the fact that a private offering occurred in factoring out the funds raised in our private offering  cash flow improved by million over results 
the largest factor contributing to the results was the decrease in our net loss 
as a consequence of achieving profitability in the second half of we have experienced further improvement in cash flow 
we anticipate a continuation of profitable operations for  which would continue to support cash flow improvement 
on january   the company entered into a mortgage loan in the amount of  the note term is years  with a principal amortization of years at a fixed rate of interest of 
land  building and improvements secure the mortgage loan 
the monthly mortgage payment is  including interest and principal 
due to the difference in the term of the note and amortization of the principal  a balloon payment of  is due on february  the principal paid in totaled  and as of december    was outstanding 
on march  we entered into a million asset based  three year  revolving loan facility at an interest rate of the prime bank lending rate plus 
the company has entered into an agreement with fleet bank to extend the current agreement through the period of june  while we negotiate a new agreement 
any unused portion of the revolving credit facility accrues interest at an annual rate of basis points 
the loan facility provides for advancing funds based upon an asset availability formula that includes our eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the availability formula sets aside a fixed amount of qualified assets that may not be borrowed against 
we may terminate the loan prior to the full term 
however  we would become liable for certain termination fees should we do so 
on december  we issued and sold  common shares to the state of wisconsin investment board at per share 
on april  and april   we issued and sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  at a purchase price of per share  to special situations fund iii  lp  special situations cayman fund  lp  special situations private equity fund  lp  and special situations technology fund  lp  pursuant to a common stock purchase agreement dated march  on april   we also issued and sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  at a purchase price of per share  to the state of wisconsin investment board  pursuant to a common stock purchase agreement dated april  on may   we issued and sold  shares of our common stock  at a purchase price of per share  to mr 
austin marxe 
we concluded our private financing on may   with the issuance and sale of  shares of our common stock  at a purchase price of per share  to the massachusetts mutual life insurance company 
in total we realized net proceeds of million  that has been used to fund operations and advanced research into photonics and mobile broadband satellite communications 
we believe that existing cash balances and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements for we periodically assess the need to raise additional funds by considering operating performance as well as considering potential decisions to expand more rapidly  to broaden or enhance products more rapidly  to acquire businesses or technologies or to make other significant expenditures to remain competitive 
should the need arise to secure additional capital  we would look to the equity and or debt markets as potential sources of funds 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are included in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets and recoverability of deferred tax assets 
the company s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on specific and historical criteria that are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
the company evaluates specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
the company uses its judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and records a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated on a monthly basis and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
an additional reserve is established for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience and are analyzed on a quarterly basis 
historically  the company s bad debt write offs have been insignificant 
if circumstances change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due the company could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company continually ensures that slow moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value by reviewing current quantities on hand  actual and projected sales volumes and anticipated selling prices on products 
generally  the company does not experience issues with obsolete inventory due to the nature of its products being interchangeable within various product offerings 
if the company were not able to achieve its expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at its current value  the company would have to adjust its reserves accordingly 
long lived assets are reviewed for indications of impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted forecast cash flows anticipated for the asset 
if such assets were considered to be impaired  the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated discounted cash flows 
the preparation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the preparation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards 
on a quarterly basis the company assesses the recoverability of the deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on the history of operating earnings in its ongoing business and its expectations in the future  the company has determined that a portion of the deferred tax assets were not recoverable and a valuation allowance was established 
for the remaining deferred tax assets the recoverability of these assets was deemed to be recoverable based on certain tax planning strategies 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be reduced in the future if there are changes in the company s feasibility of certain tax planning strategies 
additionally  if the company generates future earnings the realizability of the deferred tax assets reserved by the valuation allowance would be utilized 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas no 
specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
and subsequently  sfas no 
after its adoption 
the company adopted the provision of sfas no 
on january   and it did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
the company adopted sfas no 
on january  and it did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which is effective for the company s fiscal year fas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
fas applies to all entities 
the company s adoption of fas did not impact its financial condition or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the company adopted sfas no 
on january  and it did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which is effective for transactions occurring after may  fas rescinds fas and fas  which addressed the accounting for gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
fas set forth industry specific transitional guidance that did not apply to the company 
fas amends fas to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
fas also makes technical corrections to certain existing pronouncements that are not substantive in nature 
the company does not expect the adoption of fas to have a significant impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fas  accounting for exit or disposal activities 
fas addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance set forth in emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of fas includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease  costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees  and certain termination benefits provided to employees who are involuntarily terminated 
fas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of fas by the company will impact the accounting for future exit and disposal activities 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no  and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december   and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december   with early adoption permitted 
sfas will enable companies that choose to adopt the preferable fair value based method to report the full effect of employee stock options in their financial statements immediately upon adoption  and to make available to investors better and more frequent disclosure about the cost of employee stock options 
we will continue to apply the disclosure only provisions of both sfas and sfas contractual obligations and other commercial commitments our contractual commitments consist of a mortgage note payable  forward currency exchange contracts  facility and equipment leases 
the principal repayment of the mortgage note is based upon a year amortization schedule  but the term is years requiring a balloon payment of  due on february  there are no loan to value covenants in the loan that would require early pay down of the mortgage if the market value of the property should decline 
we have purchased foreign currency contracts to protect ourselves against further currency fluctuations of the us dollar relative to the euro 
existing contracts fix euro pricing through february we are also obligated under a multi year facility lease that terminates in our present intention is to renew the facility lease prior to its expiration in our operating leases represent vehicle and equipment operating leases 
the schedule below reflects liabilities under these agreements at december  total after mortgage loan     facility lease     foreign exchange contracts   operating leases     total contractual cash obligations    we have not entered into off balance sheet commercial commitments such as standby letters of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations or commercial commitments  other than the purchase of the forward currency exchange contracts as listed above 
other matters none 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its results of operations 
forward looking statements trends  risk and uncertainties this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
these are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
we may fail to complete our mobile broadband initiative successfully our mobile broadband project is still in the product design stage 
the kvh mobile broadband initiative is directed toward the development of a low profile satellite tv antenna that will provide in motion access to high speed  two way internet and satellite television services for the video and computer systems aboard passenger and other vehicles 
the project involves significant technical advances and there can be no assurance that we will achieve the form factor  performance  and cost parameters necessary for successful commercialization of the automotive satellite tv antenna system 
manufacturing or product design issues could also delay the shipment of the finished product beyond our anticipated first unit target date of late second quarter if we are delayed in the development of the mobile broadband technology  or we are not first to market with this technology  we may be unable to achieve significant market share in the automotive  mobile satellite communications market 
the success of our mobile broadband project depends upon our ability to develop a technologically advanced antenna at an acceptable price for the automotive marketplace 
to date  phased array antennas have been developed at prices far in excess of what is practical in the automotive marketplace 
there can be no assurance that we can engineer and manufacture a phased array solution within the pricing and technical parameters necessary to be successful in the automotive marketplace 
the success of the tracnet mobile high speed internet system depends on the performance and quality of other service providers the new tracnet service is designed to provide mobile high speed internet access to vehicles and vessels throughout north america and as far as miles off the coast of north america 
a european variant is also scheduled for production in tracnet s successful operation depends on the use of kvh s antenna and other services and equipment of third party suppliers 
tracnet relies upon the services offered by the satellite internet provider bell expressvu of canada  as well as the equipment and services of cellular and satellite return link communications suppliers 
globalstar satellite communications services  which kvh uses as the satellite return link supplier for tracnet  filed for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code on february  and currently is operating its business as a debtor in possession 
kvh is also in negotiations with a potential prospective european internet via satellite provider 
should globalstar or one of the other vendors integral to tracnet s operation be unable to fulfill its obligations  kvh would seek an alternate supplier  and kvh may have to carry out any necessary hardware and software retrofits or upgrades that may be required to ensure the continued operation of the tracnet system 
in such event  kvh may not be successful identifying and entering into appropriate agreements with replacement suppliers  which would impair our ability to offer the tracnet service 
we may fail to complete our photonic fiber development initiative successfully our photonic fiber project is currently in the development stage 
our proposed optical fiber technology would serve as the foundation for a variety of electro optic components built within or on a strand of optical fiber 
potential applications for this technology include its use in kvh s existing fiber optic gyros  navigation systems  and satellite communications products 
a future application could also include high speed  in fiber modulators that would greatly enhance the speed of transmissions over fiber optic networks 
we may never complete the technological development necessary to realize the full commercial potential of the project 
our current approach utilizes a proprietary electro optic polymer and our d fiber technology 
this initiative depends on significant technical advances  and there can be no assurance that we will achieve the intended form factor 
optical fiber telecommunications solutions are not currently and may never be economically viable solutions and the timing or magnitude of future market demand for telecommunications components is not known 
research and development expenditures could lead to continuing operating losses for the past two years we have made significant investments in research and development that have contributed to operating losses in each of those years 
in may  we completed a series of private placements that raised million  net of transaction costs  to accelerate our research into two key product areas  photonic fiber and mobile broadband 
if r d project expenditures are extended beyond our current projections or the product results of these projects are delayed  it could impact our ability to sustain profitability 
future sales growth depends on the continued expansion of satellite communications revenues the company s growth has been largely sustained by a consistent expansion of our satellite communications sales 
our future satellite communications sales growth will be based to a considerable extent upon the successful introduction of new mobile satellite communications products for use in marine and land applications 
our success depends heavily on rapid completion of new products  including worldwide internet and data applications 
however  poor consumer confidence and or economic conditions could depress product demand 
our success also depends on external variables such as consumers access to satellite communication services  which may be hindered because satellite launches and new technology are expensive and subject to failures  which may depress demand for our products 
defense related sales could be adversely affected by political and international events recent world events and a shift in military planning to favor rapid deployment and lighter vehicles put a premium on precision navigation  a feature offered by kvh s integrated tactical navigation systems 
however  the growth of the company s defense related revenues could be adversely affected by delays in the current military procurement schedule  an unexpected shift or reallocation of anticipated funding for military programs  delays in the testing and acceptance of our technological solutions by the military  and sales cycles that are long and difficult to predict in military markets 
the rapid growth experienced in may not repeat in  based upon the cyclical nature of the military order flow 
substantial fluctuations in sales can result quarter to quarter and year to year 
our operating results are variable our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending upon the risk factors in this section and whether we are successful in managing our assets  revenue growth and the ratio of expenses to revenues 
our share price has displayed volatility the company s stock has experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the company and our competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these factors  as well as general economic and political conditions  may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock in the future 
our consumer product sales are dependent on the financial strength and performance of our distribution network many of our consumer oriented products are marketed through a worldwide network of third party value added resellers  distributors  and independent sales representatives 
many of the company s resellers operate on narrow product margins  and may distribute products from competing manufacturers 
the company s business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens  if resellers within consumer channels cease distribution of the company s products  or if uncertainty regarding demand for the company s products causes resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products 
if we fail to commercialize new product lines  our business will suffer we intend to continue to develop new product lines and to improve existing product lines to meet our customers diverse and changing needs 
however  our development of new products and improvements to existing products may not be successful  due to our failure to complete the development of a new product or product improvement  or our failure to sell our new product or improved product because  among other things  the product is too expensive  is defective in design  manufacture or performance  is inferior to similar products on the market  or has been superceded by a superior product or technology 
furthermore  new products require increased sales and marketing  customer support  and administrative functions to support anticipated increased levels of operations 
we may not be successful in creating this infrastructure  and we may not realize a sufficient increase in gross profit to offset the expenses resulting from this expanded infrastructure 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our proprietary technology the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of risk 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 
claims by other companies that we infringe their copyrights or patents could adversely affect our financial condition if any of our products violate third party proprietary rights  we may be required to reengineer our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties to continue to offer our products 
any efforts to reengineer our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful  and  in any case  would substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we do not generally conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties 
in addition  product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  with regard to similar technologies 
although we are generally indemnified against claims that third party technology that we license infringes the proprietary rights of others  this indemnification is not always available for all types of intellectual property rights for example  patents may be excluded and in some cases the scope of such indemnification is limited 
even if we receive broad indemnification  third party indemnitors are not always well capitalized and may not be able to indemnify us in the event of infringement  resulting in substantial exposure to us 
there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims arising from the incorporation of third party technology in our products  and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from these claims  will not be asserted or prosecuted against us 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays  all of which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract our management from their business 
a party making a claim also could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our products 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience  and efforts of the company s ceo  martin kits van heyningen  and our senior executives the loss of the services of mr 
kits van heyningen could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we also depend on the ability of our executive officers and other members of senior management to work effectively as a team 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 
general economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the company the company s operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions 
demand for some of the company s consumer oriented products displayed slower than anticipated growth as a result of worsening global economic conditions 
continued uncertainty about future economic conditions has also made it increasingly difficult to forecast future operating results 
should global and regional economic conditions fail to improve or continue to deteriorate  demand for the company s products could be adversely affected  as could the financial health of its suppliers  distributors  and resellers 
demand for our products can also be affected by stock market weakness 
this is especially true for sales to the marine market
