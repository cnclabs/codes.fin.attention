net sales reached a historical high of  in  an increase of  or  from the increased revenues were primarily the result of new product introductions in fiscal year and the continuing success of megestrol acetate oral suspension megace r oral suspension  introduced in the third quarter of the revenue increase was achieved despite lower sales of fluoxetine prozac r mg and mg tablets  which were introduced with day exclusivity in august and experienced severe price competition in fiscal year the sales growth generated increased gross margins of  or of net sales  in fiscal year  compared to  or of net sales  in results for fiscal year included increased spending on research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses of  and  respectively  primarily due to increased activity with outside development partners  and additional legal fees  personnel costs  product liability insurance and shipping costs associated with new product launches 
additionally  the company recorded income from settlements of  in the first quarter of related to the termination of its litigation with bms and acquisition termination charges of  in connection with its termination of the acquisition of the combined isp finetech fine chemical business based in haifa  israel and columbus  ohio 
the company subsequently purchased finetech  based in haifa  israel  from isp in april the purchase of finetech did not have a material effect on the company s earnings for fiscal year the company s net income of  for fiscal year  which included the reversal of a previously established valuation allowance related to nol carryforwards  increased  from a net loss of  for fiscal year the company did not recognize a tax benefit for its losses in fiscal year the revenue increase of  or  in from revenues generated during  reflected the successful launch of three products that benefited from marketing exclusivity in fiscal year  fluoxetine mg and mg tablets  fluoxetine mg capsules and megestrol acetate oral suspension 
net sales were  for fiscal year compared to net sales of  in fiscal year accompanying the sales growth  the gross margins increased to  or of net sales  in  from  or of net sales  in the improved results included an increased investment in research and development  which totaled  for fiscal year  an increase of  from fiscal year in fiscal year  selling  general and administrative costs were  an increase of  from the previous year  primarily due to additional marketing programs  shipping costs and legal fees associated with new product launches 
in addition to its own product development program  the company has several strategic alliances through which it co develops and distributes products 
as a result of its internal program and these strategic alliances  the company s pipeline of potential products includes andas seven of which have been tentatively approved  pending with  and awaiting approval from  the fda 
the company pays a percentage of the gross profits to its strategic partners on sales of products covered by its distribution agreements 
generally  products that the company develops internally  without having to split gross profits with its strategic partners  would contribute higher gross margins than products covered under distribution agreements see notes to consolidated financial statements research and development agreements and distribution and supply agreements 
in july and august  the fda granted approvals for three anda submissions  one each by par  dr 
reddy s laboratories ltd 
reddy and alphapharm pty ltd  an australian subsidiary of merck kgaa  for megestrol acetate oral suspension  fluoxetine mg capsules and fluoxetine mg and mg tablets  respectively  which as first to file opportunities entitled the company to days of marketing exclusivity for the products 
the company began marketing megestrol acetate oral suspension  which is not subject to any profit sharing agreements  in july in august  the company began marketing fluoxetine mg capsules covered under a distribution agreement with reddy and fluoxetine mg and mg tablets covered under a distribution agreement with genpharm 
generic competitors of the company received days marketing exclusivity for the generic version of fluoxetine mg and mg capsules  which the company began selling in the first quarter of following the expiration of such other party s exclusivity period 
as expected  additional generic competitors  with products comparable to all three strengths of the company s fluoxetine products  began entering the market in the first quarter of  eroding the pricing the company received during the exclusivity periods  particularly on the mg and mg strengths 
despite another generic approval for megestrol acetate oral suspension in the first quarter of  to date the company still maintains a significant share of the market for this product 
although megestrol oral suspension and fluoxetine mg capsules are expected to continue to contribute significantly to the company s overall performance  the rapid growth of the company s product line through new product introductions and  to a lesser extent  increased sales of certain existing products have reduced its reliance on each of these key products 
critical to the continued growth of the company is the introduction of new manufactured and distributed products at selling prices that generate significant gross margins 
the company  through its internal development program and strategic alliances  is committed to developing new products that have limited competition and longer product life cycles 
in addition to new product introductions expected as part of its various strategic alliances  the company plans to continue to invest in its internal research and development efforts while seeking additional products for sale through new and existing distribution agreements  additional first to file opportunities  vertical integration with raw material suppliers and unique dosage forms and strengths to differentiate its products in the marketplace 
the company is engaged in efforts  subject to fda approval and other factors  to introduce new products as a result of its research and development efforts and distribution and development agreements with third parties 
no assurance can be given that the company will obtain or develop any additional products for sale 
sales and gross margins of the company s products are principally dependent upon i pricing and product deletions by competitors  ii the introduction of other generic drug manufacturers products in direct competition with the company s significant products  iii the ability of generic competitors to quickly enter the market after patent or exclusivity period expirations  diminishing the amount and duration of significant profits from any one product  iv the continuation of existing distribution agreements  v the introduction of new distributed products  vi the consolidation among distribution outlets through mergers  acquisitions and the formation of buying groups  vii the willingness of generic drug customers  including wholesale and retail customers  to switch among generic pharmaceutical manufacturers  viii approval of andas and introduction of new manufactured products  ix granting of potential exclusivity periods  x market penetration for the existing product line and xi the level of customer service see business competition 
net sales net sales of  for fiscal year increased  or  from net sales in fiscal year the sales increase was primarily due to higher sales of megestrol acetate oral suspension  introduced in late july  new products introduced in fiscal year  particularly tizanidine zanaflex r  metformin glucophage r  flecainide tambocor r and nizatidine axid r  sold under distribution agreements with reddy or genpharm  and the addition of five bms brand products  sold pursuant to an agreement with bms 
net sales of fluoxetine and megestrol acetate oral suspension in fiscal year were  and  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  in the prior year 
net sales of distributed products  which consist of products manufactured under contract and licensed products  were approximately and  respectively  of the company s net sales in fiscal years and the company is substantially dependent upon distributed products for its overall sales  and as the company introduces new products under its distribution agreements  it is expected that this dependence will continue 
any inability by suppliers to meet expected demand could adversely affect future sales 
the company s exclusivity period for fluoxetine expired in late january the company established a price protection reserve with respect to fluoxetine during the exclusivity period of approximately  based on its estimate that between eight and ten additional generic manufacturers would introduce and market comparable products for the mg and mg tablets and between one and three additional manufacturers would introduce and market a comparable product for the mg capsules 
in fiscal year  the company issued price protection credits totaling approximately  and eliminated the price protection reserve it believed was no longer necessary 
pursuant to distribution agreements with strategic partners  the elimination of the remaining reserve had a favorable impact on the company s gross margin of approximately  in fiscal year as a result of the introduction of these competing generic products during the first quarter of  the sales price for fluoxetine has substantially declined from the price the company charged during the exclusivity period 
accordingly  the company s sales and gross margins generated by fluoxetine in fiscal year were and will continue to be adversely affected see notes to consolidated financial statements accounts receivable 
the company s exclusivity period for megestrol acetate oral suspension expired in mid january one generic competitor was granted fda approval to market another generic version of megestrol acetate oral suspension and began shipping the product to a limited number of customers in the second quarter of in addition  a second potential generic competitor entered into a settlement agreement with bms pursuant to which the public record states that the present formulation of the generic company s product infringes a bms patent 
however  at this time the company has no information as to whether the settlement agreement provides for the generic competitor to enter the market at some point in the future 
the company has patents that cover its unique formulation for megestrol acetate oral suspension and will avail itself of all legal remedies and take steps necessary to protect its intellectual property rights 
although competitors may be taking the steps necessary to enter the market  the company believes it will be difficult for them to successfully enter this market because of patents owned by bms or the company 
megestrol acetate oral suspension is still anticipated by the company to be a significant profit contributor for fiscal year  despite the potential of competition 
in accordance with the company s accounting policies  the company did not record a price protection reserve for megestrol acetate oral suspension as of december  the company will continue to evaluate the effect of potential competition and will record a price protection reserve when and as it deems necessary 
pursuant to a profit sharing agreement with genpharm the genpharm profit sharing agreement  the company will receive a portion of the profits generated from the sale of omeprazole  the generic version of astra zeneca s astra prilosec r 
in november  the fda granted genpharm days marketing co exclusivity for mg and mg doses of omeprazole 
the exclusivity would have allowed only genpharm and or andrx corporation andrx  a pharmaceutical company located in fort lauderdale  florida  to enter the market during the exclusivity period 
under the genpharm profit sharing agreement  the company was entitled to receive at least of profits generated by genpharm based on the sale of omeprazole 
in november  the company announced that genpharm and andrx  in conjunction with kudco  a subsidiary of schwarz pharma ag of germany  had relinquished exclusivity rights for mg and mg doses of omeprazole  thereby allowing kudco to enter the market with a generic version of prilosec r 
as a result  kudco received final anda approval from the fda for its generic version of prilosec r 
the terms of the agreement provide genpharm with an initial share of kudco s profits  as defined in their agreement  with a subsequent reduction over time based on a number of factors 
the company reduced its share of genpharm s profit derived from omeprazole pursuant to the genpharm profit sharing agreement from to 
in december  kudco launched omeprazole at risk because astra appealed the court s patent infringement decision 
the full impact of kudco s omeprazole launch on the company s revenues is presently unclear since  among other things  astra has introduced a new drug  nexium r  in an apparent attempt to switch consumers using prilosec r and astra s decision to market a non prescription form of prilosec r along with proctor gamble  all of which may reduce generic sales of omeprazole 
in december  the company recognized of revenues related to its share of genpharm profits  which were significantly reduced as genpharm recovered out of pocket development and legal expenses incurred during the product development and litigation process 
these expenses were substantially recovered by genpharm in unless there is a court ruling that is unfavorable to kudco in the pending appeal by astra  in which case the company could be obligated to return any payments received from genpharm  the company anticipates recording revenues of up to  in fiscal year from its share of the profits on omeprazole 
net sales for fiscal year of  increased  or  from net sales of  for fiscal year the sales increase was primarily due to the launch in the third quarter of of fluoxetine mg and mg tablets sold under a distribution agreement with genpharm  fluoxetine mg capsules sold under a distribution agreement with reddy  and megestrol acetate oral suspension manufactured by the company 
net sales of distributed products represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s net sales in fiscal years and gross margins the gross margin for fiscal year of  of net sales increased  from  of net sales in the prior year 
the gross margin improvement was achieved primarily through the additional contributions from sales of higher margin new products  including megestrol acetate oral suspension and  to a lesser extent  increased sales of certain existing products 
megestrol acetate oral suspension contributed an additional  in fiscal year to the gross margin improvement when compared to fiscal year as previously discussed  additional generic drug manufacturers introduced comparable fluoxetine products at the expiration of the company s exclusivity period that adversely affected the company s sales volumes  selling prices and gross margins for such products  particularly the mg and mg strengths 
the effects of gross margin declines from lower pricing on the fluoxetine mg capsule have been partially offset  however  by an increase in the company s profit sharing percentage under an agreement with reddy 
although aggregate sales of the fluoxetine products declined in  the increased profits on the mg capsule lessened the impact of the lower margin contributions from the mg and mg strengths 
the company s gross margin for megestrol acetate oral suspension could also decline if additional manufacturers enter the market with comparable generic products 
the gross margin of  of net sales for fiscal year increased  from  of net sales in fiscal year the gross margin improvement was achieved through additional contributions from sales of higher margin new products and  to a lesser extent  increased sales of certain existing products and more favorable manufacturing overhead variances 
for fiscal year  fluoxetine  which is subject to profit sharing agreements with genpharm and reddy  contributed approximately  to the gross margin improvement while megestrol acetate oral suspension contributed approximately inventory write offs amounted to  for fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year the increase was primarily attributable to normally occurring write offs resulting from increased production required to meet higher sales and inventory levels 
the inventory write offs  taken in the normal course of business  are related primarily to work in process inventory not meeting the company s quality control standards and the disposal of finished products due to short shelf lives 
in addition  the company experienced both the write off of inventory for a product whose launch was delayed due to unexpected patent issues and certain raw material not meeting the company s quality control standards in fiscal year inventory write offs of  for fiscal year were comparable to  in fiscal year in addition to write offs taken in the normal course of business  inventory write offs in fiscal year included the disposal of validation batches related to manufacturing process improvements 
in fiscal year  the company s top four selling products accounted for approximately of net sales compared to and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal years and one of the products  tizanidine  was not one of the top four products in either of the preceding periods and accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales 
the aggregate sales and gross margins generated by fluoxetine and megestrol acetate oral suspension continued to account for a significant portion of the company s overall sales and gross margins in both fiscal years and and any further reductions in pricing for these products will continue to reduce future contributions of these products to the company s overall financial performance 
although there can be no such assurance  the company anticipates continuing to introduce new products in fiscal year and attempt to increase sales of certain existing products in an effort to offset the sales and gross margin declines resulting from competition on any of its significant products 
the company will also try to reduce the overall impact of the top four products  by adding additional products through new and existing distribution agreements and seeking to gain efficiencies through manufacturing process improvements 
operating expenses income research and development research and development expenses of  for fiscal year increased  or  from  for the prior year 
the increased costs were primarily attributable to additional payments of approximately  for development work performed for the company by unaffiliated companies  particularly elan transdermal technologies  inc elan  related to the development of a clonidine transdermal patch and other products and  to a lesser extent  higher costs for personnel  the acquisition of finetech and funding of svc pharma  the company s joint venture partnership 
these expenses were partially offset by lower biostudy costs  primarily related to products covered under distribution agreements with genpharm  in fiscal year total research and development costs for fiscal year are expected to exceed the total for fiscal year by approximately to 
the increase is expected as a result of increased internal development activity and projects with third parties  increased research and development venture activity and the inclusion of finetech activities for the full year

critical accounting policies and use of estimates critical accounting policies are those most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s most critical accounting policies  discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition including the determination of sales returns and allowances  the determination of whether certain costs pertaining to the company s significant development and marketing agreements are capitalized or expensed as incurred  the valuation and assessment of impairment of intangible assets  the determination of depreciable and amortizable lives  the determination of pension benefits and issues related to legal proceedings 
in applying such policies  management must use some amounts that are based on its informed judgments and estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these estimates  actual results could differ from estimates used in applying the critical accounting policies 
the company is not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect its financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable and reserves at the time product is shipped and title passes to its customers  the company recognizes revenue and simultaneously records an estimate for sales returns  chargebacks  rebates  price protection adjustments or other sales allowances  as a reduction in revenue  with a corresponding adjustment to the accounts receivable reserves see notes to consolidated financial statements accounts receivable 
the company has the historical experience and access to other information  including the total demand for each drug the company manufactures or distributes  the company s market share  the recent or pending introduction of new drugs  the inventory practices of the company s customers  the resales by its customers to end users having contracts with the company  and rebate agreements with each customer  necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such sales returns and allowances 
some of the assumptions used for certain of the company s estimates are based on information received from third parties  such as customer inventories at a particular point in time  or other market factors beyond the company s control 
the company regularly reviews all information related to these estimates and adjusts the reserves accordingly if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
the company s reserves related to the items described above  at december  and  totaled  and  respectively 
customer rebates are price reductions generally given to customers as an incentive to increase sales volume 
this incentive is based on a customer s volume of purchases made during an applicable monthly  quarterly or annual period 
chargebacks are price adjustments given to the wholesale customer for product it resells to specific healthcare providers on the basis of prices negotiated between the company and the provider 
the company accepts returns of product according to the following i the returns must be approved by authorized personnel in writing or by telephone with the lot number and expiration date accompanying any request  ii the company generally will accept returns of products from any customer and will give such customer a credit for such return provided such product is returned within six months prior to  and until months following  such product s expiration date  iii any product that has more than six months until its expiration date may be returned to the company  however  no credit will be issued to the customer  iv the company will not accept returns of products if such products cannot be resold  unless the reason that such products cannot be resold is that the expiration date has passed 
in addition  private label stock is not returnable 
the company s provision for returns has increased in fiscal year primarily due to higher overall sales volumes and a higher rate of returns from several brand products the company began selling in pursuant to an agreement with bms 
the accounts receivable reserves also include provisions for cash discounts  sales promotions and price protection 
cash or terms discounts are given to customers who pay within a specific period of time 
sales or trade show promotions may be run by the company where additional discounts may be given on a new product or certain existing products as an added incentive for the customer to purchase the company s products 
the company generally offers price protection  or shelf stock adjustments  with respect to sales of new generic drugs for which it has a market exclusivity period 
price protection accounts for the fact that the price of such drugs typically will decline  sometimes substantially  when additional generic manufacturers introduce and market a comparable generic product at the end of the exclusivity period 
such plans  which are common in the industry  generally provide for a credit to customers with respect to the customer s remaining inventory at the end of the exclusivity period for the difference between the company s new price and the price at which the company originally sold the product 
the company estimates the amount by which prices will decline based on its monitoring of the number and status of fda applications and tentative approvals and its historical experience with other drugs for which the company had market exclusivity 
the company estimates the amount of shelf stock that will remain at the end of an exclusivity period based on both its knowledge of the inventory practices for wholesalers and retail distributors and conversations it has with its major customers 
using these factors  the company estimates the total price protection credit it will have to issue at the end of an exclusivity period and records charges reductions of sales to accrue this amount for specific product sales that will be subject to price protection based on the company s estimate of customer inventory levels and market prices at the end of the exclusivity period 
as noted above  although the company believes it has the information necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such price protection at the time the product is sold  there are inherent risks associated with these estimates 
the company adjusts its price protection reserves accordingly if and when actual experience differs from those estimates 
at december   the company did not have any significant price protection reserves 
at december   the company s price protection reserve was  inventory reserves the company examines inventory levels  including expiration dates by product  on a regular basis 
the company makes provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventories as necessary to properly reflect inventory value with changes in these provisions charged to cost of goods sold 
inventory reserves at december  and  respectively  totaled  and  research and development and marketing agreements the company will either capitalize or expense amounts related to the development and marketing of new products and technologies through third parties based on the company s determination of its ability to recover in a reasonable period of time the estimated future cash flows anticipated to be generated pursuant to each agreement 
under the company s accounting policies  amounts related to the company s funding of the research and development efforts of others or to the purchase of contractual rights to products that have not been approved by the fda where the company has no alternative future use for the product  are expensed and included in research and development costs 
amounts for contractual rights acquired by the company to a process  product or other legal right having multiple or alternative future uses that support its realizabilty  as well as  an approved product  are capitalized and included in intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company records the value of these agreements based on the purchase price and subsequent milestone payments related to each agreement 
capitalized costs are amortized on an accelerated basis over the estimated useful life over which the related cash flows are expected to be generated and charged to cost of goods sold 
changing market  regulatory or legal factors  among other things  may affect the realizability of the projected cash flows an agreement was expected to generate 
the company regularly monitors these factors and subjects all capitalized costs to periodic impairment testing 
goodwill and intangible assets the company determines the estimated fair values of goodwill and certain intangible assets with definitive lives based on purchase price allocations performed by independent third party valuation firms at the time of acquisition 
in addition  certain amounts paid to third parties related to the development and marketing of new products and technologies  as described above  are capitalized and included in intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
the goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment using a fair value approach 
intangible assets with definitive lives  also tested periodically for impairment  are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
as a result of the acquisition of finetech in fiscal year  the company had recorded goodwill of  at december  in addition  intangible assets with definitive lives  net of accumulated amortization  totaled  and  respectively  at december  and pension benefits the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent on its selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in notes to consolidated financial statements commitments  contingencies and other matters and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods 
while the company believes its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect pension obligations and future expense 
legal proceedings the company records its costs  including patent litigation expenses  related to legal proceedings as incurred in selling  general and administrative expenses 
as discussed in notes to consolidated financial statements commitments  contingencies and other matters  the company is a party to several patent infringement matters whose outcome could have a material impact on its future profitability  cash flows and financial condition 
the company is also currently involved in other litigation matters  including certain patent actions  product liability and actions by former employees and believes these actions are incidental to the business and that the ultimate resolution thereof will not have a material adverse effect on its future profitability  cash flows or financial condition 
the company is defending or intends to defend all of these actions vigorously
