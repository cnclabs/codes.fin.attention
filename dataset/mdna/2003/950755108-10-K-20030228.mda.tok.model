item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition critical accounting policies the company s success depends on its ability to efficiently manage its resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to its customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand  which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
the company s ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is a key element in efficiently deploying resources and in making capital investments in tractors and trailers 
although the company s business volume is not highly concentrated  the company may also be affected by the financial failure of its customers or a loss of a customer s business from time to time 
the company s greatest resource requirements include qualified drivers  tractors  trailers  and related costs of operating its equipment such as fuel and related fuel taxes  driver pay  insurance  and supplies and maintenance 
the company has historically been successful mitigating its risk to increases in fuel prices by recovering additional fuel surcharges from its customers 
the company s financial results are also affected by availability of qualified drivers and the market for new and used trucks 
because the company is self insured for cargo  personal injury  and property damage claims on its trucks and for workers compensation benefits for its employees supplemented by premium based coverage above certain dollar levels  financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  the weather  the legal and regulatory environment  and the costs of insurance coverage to protect against catastrophic losses 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect our financial statements include the following selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers range from to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sale for example  three years for tractors are based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal 
estimates of accrued liabilities for insurance and claims for liability and physical damage losses and workers compensation 
the insurance and claims accruals current and long term are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts and are based upon individual case estimates  including negative development  and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
together with the effects of the matters discussed above  these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of income and expense items to operating revenues for the years indicated 
operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits fuel supplies and maintenance taxes and licenses insurance and claims depreciation rent and purchased transportation communications and utilities other total operating expenses operating income net interest expense and other income before income taxes income taxes net income the following table sets forth certain industry data regarding the freight revenues and operations of the company 
operating ratio average revenues per tractor per week      average annual miles per tractor      average total miles per trip loaded and empty average revenues per total mile average revenues per loaded mile average percentage of empty miles non trucking revenues in thousands      average tractors in service      total tractors at year end company      owner operator     total tractors      total trailers at year end      net of fuel surcharge revenues 
compared to operating revenues increased over  due primarily to a increase in the average number of tractors in service 
revenue per total mile  excluding fuel surcharges  increased primarily due to customer rate increases and better freight mix 
a better freight market and tightening truck capacity contributed to the improvement  compared to the weaker freight market of over the past several months  the company has been meeting with customers to explain the current state of the truckload industry 
both truckload industry and company margins  while improving  are below levels management considers acceptable for the investment and risk of operating in this industry 
the company is actively negotiating rate increases 
revenue per total mile  including fuel surcharges  increased compared to fuel surcharges  which represent collections from customers for the higher cost of fuel  decreased from million in to million in due to lower average fuel prices during see fuel explanation below 
excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues increased over revenue from non trucking services increased million compared to freight demand began to improve in mid april of as compared to the same date in  and continued to be consistently better for the last eight and one half months of compared to the corresponding period in the company s empty mile percentage decreased from to 
the company believes much of the improvement was achieved by execution of the company s plan of limited fleet growth and maintenance of a diversified freight base that emphasizes consumer nondurable goods 
the company s operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues improved from in to in conversely  the company s operating margin improved from in to in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in this decrease contributed to a shift in costs from the rent and purchased transportation expense category as described on the following pages 
owner operators are independent contractors who supply their own tractor and driver and are responsible for their operating expenses including fuel  supplies and maintenance  and fuel taxes 
over the past year  it has been more difficult to attract and retain owner operator drivers due to challenging operating conditions 
salaries  wages and benefits increased from to of revenues due in part to an increase in the cost of workers compensation claims  higher workers compensation excess insurance premiums  and higher weekly state workers compensation payments 
the company renewed its workers compensation insurance coverage  and for the policy year beginning april  the company increased its self insurance retention from million to million per claim and has premium based coverage with a reputable insurance company for claims above this amount 
the company s premiums for this reduced coverage increased by approximately million over the premiums from the prior policy year 
in addition  the company added about employees in its maintenance department to reduce the higher cost of over the road repairs which are reflected in supplies and maintenance expenses 
these increases were partially offset by an improvement in health insurance expense 
the market for attracting and retaining company drivers continues to be challenging 
the company anticipates that the competition for qualified drivers will continue to be high and cannot predict whether it will experience shortages in the future 
if such a shortage was to occur and increases in driver pay rates became necessary to attract and retain drivers  the company s results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that corresponding freight rate increases were not obtained 
fuel decreased from to of revenues due to lower fuel prices 
the average price per gallon of diesel fuel  excluding fuel taxes  was approximately 
per gallon  or  lower in versus however  as diesel fuel prices gradually declined during fourth quarter  prices rose during fourth quarter and averaged about 
per gallon  or  higher 
fuel prices in january and february were about cents per gallon  or  higher than the same period a year ago 
the company s customer fuel surcharge reimbursement programs have historically enabled the company to recover from its customers much of the higher fuel prices compared to normalized average fuel prices 
these fuel surcharges  which automatically adjust from week to week depending on the cost of fuel  enable the company to recoup a significant portion of the higher cost of fuel when prices increase 
conversely  when fuel prices decrease  fuel surcharges decrease 
after considering the amounts collected from customers through fuel surcharge programs  net of company reimbursements to owner operators  earnings per share decreased by approximately 
compared to  including a 
per share decrease occurring in fourth quarter shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices  or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse effect on the operations and profitability of the company 
the company is unable to predict whether fuel prices will continue to increase or will decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges will be collected from customers 
as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
supplies and maintenance decreased from to of revenues due to improved management of maintenance expenses  including performing more maintenance at company facilities versus higher cost over the road maintenance 
the increase in the amount of maintenance being performed at company facilities required the hiring of additional maintenance personnel  resulting in a slight shift in expenses from the supplies and maintenance expense category to salaries  wages and benefits see salaries  wages and benefits explanation above 
insurance and claims increased from to of revenues due to less favorable claims experience in and higher excess insurance premiums 
insurance premiums in the liability insurance market have increased significantly for many truckload carriers 
for fifteen years  the company has been self insured and managed virtually all of its liability  cargo  and property damage claims with qualified risk department professionals 
the company renewed its annual liability insurance coverage for coverage in excess of million per claim effective august  the company s premium rate for liability coverage from million to million per claim is fixed through august   while coverage levels above million per claim will be renewed effective august  for the policy year beginning august   the company s total premiums for liability insurance remained almost the same as the prior policy year while the company assumed liability for claims above million and below million per claim 
liability claims in excess of million per claim  if they occur  are covered under premium based policies with reputable insurance companies 
rent and purchased transportation expense decreased from to of revenues due to a decrease in payments to owner operators of revenues in compared to in  offset by an increase in purchased transportation for non trucking services 
the decrease in payments to owner operators resulted from the decrease in owner operator miles as a percentage of total company miles as discussed previously and lower fuel surcharge reimbursements paid to owner operators due to lower average fuel prices 
the company has experienced difficulty recruiting and retaining owner operators because of challenging operating conditions 
this has resulted in a reduction in the number of owner operator tractors from  as of december   to  as of december  the company reimburses owner operators for the higher cost of fuel based on fuel surcharge reimbursements collected from customers 
other operating expenses decreased from to of revenues due primarily to an increase in the resale value of the company s used trucks 
because of truckload carrier concerns with new truck engines and lower industry production of new trucks  the resale value of the company s premium used trucks has improved 
in  the company traded about half of its used trucks and sold about half of its used trucks and realized gains of million 
in  the company traded about two thirds of its used trucks and sold about one third to third parties 
in  due to a lower average sale price per truck  the company realized losses of million 
for trucks traded  the excess of the trade price over the net book value of the trucks reduces the cost basis of new trucks  and therefore results in lower depreciation expense over the life of the asset 
other operating expenses also include bad debt expenses and professional service fees 
net interest expense and other decreased from to of revenues due primarily to the company s gain on sale of a portion of its ownership in transplace in fourth quarter on december   the company finalized the sale  which reduced the company s ownership stake in transplace from to 
werner relinquished its seat on the transplace board of directors 
transplace agreed to release werner from certain restrictions on competition within the transportation logistics marketplace 
the company s gain on sale of a portion of its ownership in transplace  net of losses recorded on its investment in transplace  is recorded as non operating income in the company s income statement 
interest expense decreased to from of revenues due to a reduction in the company s borrowings 
average debt outstanding in was million versus million in the company s effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes was in and  respectively  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
the company expects the income tax rate to be the tax rate in effect for compared to operating revenues increased over  due primarily to a increase in the average number of tractors in service 
revenue per total mile  excluding fuel surcharges  increased primarily due to customer rate increases  and revenue per total mile  including fuel surcharges  increased compared to fuel surcharges  which represent collections from customers for the higher cost of fuel  decreased from million in to million in due to lower average fuel prices see fuel explanation below 
excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues increased over revenue from non trucking transportation services increased million compared to freight demand during was soft due to a weaker us economy as compared to however  the company developed its freight base and utilized its proprietary technology so that it experienced only a decrease in its average annual miles per tractor 
the company s empty mile percentage increased slightly  by one tenth of one percentage point from to 
the company s operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues increased from in to in the decrease in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles in compared to in contributed to a shift in costs from the rent and purchased transportation expense category as described below 
salaries  wages and benefits increased from to of revenues due in part to a higher percentage of company drivers as compared to owner operators and an increase in the number of drivers in training 
workers compensation and health insurance expense increased due to rising medical costs and higher weekly state workers compensation payment rates 
these increases were partially offset by an improvement in the tractor to non driver employee ratio  which lowered non driver labor costs per mile 
fuel decreased from to of revenues due to lower fuel prices  principally in the fourth quarter of the average price per gallon of diesel fuel  excluding fuel taxes  was approximately 
per gallon lower in versus the average price per gallon in fourth quarter was approximately 
per gallon lower than the average price for the year of and was about the same as the average historical fuel price levels over the past ten years 
after considering the amounts collected from customers through fuel surcharge programs  net of reimbursements to owner operators  earnings per share increased by approximately 
over due to lower fuel costs 
as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
supplies and maintenance increased from to of revenues due to a higher percentage of company drivers compared to owner operators during and more maintenance services performed over the road than at company facilities 
insurance and claims increased from to of revenues due to unfavorable claims experience in and higher excess insurance premiums 
as a result of the company s self insurance program for liability  cargo  and property damage claims  higher liability insurance rates have had a less significant effect on the company  impacting the company only for catastrophic claim coverage 
the company renewed its annual catastrophic liability insurance coverage effective august   and the effect of the increase in premiums was less than of the company s total annual insurance and claims expense 
rent and purchased transportation expense decreased from to of revenues because of a decrease in payments to owner operators of revenue in compared to in  offset by an increase in purchased transportation relating to remaining non trucking operations following the transfer of most of the company s logistics business to transplace 
the decrease in payments to owner operators resulted from the decrease in owner operator miles as a percentage of total company miles as discussed above 
the company has experienced difficulty recruiting and retaining owner operators because of high fuel prices  a weak used truck pricing market  and other factors 
this has resulted in a reduction in the number of owner operator tractors from  as of december   to  as of december  other operating expenses changed from a credit of to an expense of of revenues due in part to a weak market for the sale of used trucks 
record levels of trucks manufactured during and  an increased supply of used trucks caused in part by trucking company business failures  and slower fleet growth by many carriers have all contributed to a decline in the market value of used trucks 
during  the company traded about two thirds of its used trucks and sold about one third to third parties 
for trucks traded  the excess of the trade price over the net book value of the trucks reduced the cost basis of new trucks 
in  the company traded half of its used trucks and sold half of its used trucks to third parties through its fleet truck sales retail network and realized gains of million 
in  due to a lower average sale price per truck  the company realized losses of million 
the company renegotiated its trade agreements with its primary truck manufacturer in june and continued to expand its nationwide retail truck sales network in response to the weak used truck market 
other operating expenses were also impacted by increasing the allowance for uncollectible receivables for the company s maximum credit exposure related to the fourth quarter enron bankruptcy of approximately million 
this receivable was written off during net interest expense and other decreased from to of revenues due to lower interest expense  offset partially by the company s share of transplace operating losses 
interest expense decreased from to of revenues due to a reduction in the company s borrowings 
average debt outstanding in was million versus million in in  the company recorded a loss of approximately million as its percentage share of estimated transplace losses versus a gain of approximately million in the company s effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes was and in and  respectively  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
the effective income tax rate for the period decreased due to the implementation of certain tax strategies liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in excluding the million refund of income taxes received in first quarter  which resulted from the implementation of certain tax strategies  cash flow from operations increased million in over  or 
this increase was the result of higher net income million  increased deferred taxes due to growth of the company truck fleet million  offset by an increase in cash used for working capital items million 
the cash flow from operations enabled the company to make capital expenditures and repay debt as discussed below 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in  and million in the increase million from to was due primarily to the company s accelerated purchases of tractors with pre october engines 
the engine emission standards that became effective october  did not allow the company sufficient time to test a significant sample of the new engines 
this prompted the company to purchase a large number of trucks with pre october engines  which are not subject to the new engine emission standards 
net capital expenditures in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the capital expenditures in   and were financed primarily with cash on hand and cash provided by operations 
as a result of the accelerated truck purchases in  capital expenditures in the first half of are expected to be lower  and the company expects to generate free cash flow cash flow from operations less capital expenditures in the first half of truck purchases in the second half of will depend on the company s ongoing testing and evaluation of the new engines 
as of december   the company has committed to approximately million of net capital expenditures 
net financing activities used million in  million in  and million in in   and the company made net repayments of debt of million  million  and million  respectively 
the company paid dividends of million in and million in and financing activities also included common stock repurchases of million in and million in from time to time  the company has repurchased  and may continue to repurchase  shares of its common stock 
the timing and amount of such purchases depends on market and other factors 
the company s board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to  shares 
as of december   the company had purchased  shares pursuant to this authorization and has  shares remaining available for repurchase 
management believes the company s financial position at december  is strong 
as of december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of debt  and million of stockholders equity 
as of december   the company has no equipment operating leases  and therefore  has no off balance sheet equipment debt 
based on the company s strong financial position  management foresees no significant barriers to obtaining sufficient financing  if necessary 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period in millions other commercial total amounts commitments committed less than year years years over years unused lines of credit standby letters of credit other commercial commitments total commercial commitments the unused lines of credit are available to the company in the event the company needs financing for the growth of its fleet 
with the company s strong financial position  the company expects it could obtain additional financing  if necessary  at favorable terms 
the standby letters of credit are primarily required for insurance policies 
the other commercial commitments relate to committed equipment expenditures 
inflation inflation can be expected to have an impact on the company s operating costs 
a prolonged period of inflation could cause interest rates  fuel  wages  and other costs to increase and could adversely affect the company s results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
forward looking statements and risk factors this discussion and analysis contains historical and forward looking information 
the forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company believes the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements are reasonable based on information currently available  however any of the assumptions could be inaccurate  and therefore  actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risks and uncertainties 
those risks include  but are not limited to  the following the company s business is modestly seasonal with peak freight demand occurring generally in the months of september  october  and november 
during the winter months  the company s freight volumes are typically lower as some customers have lower shipment levels after the christmas holiday season 
the company s operating expenses have historically been higher in winter months primarily due to decreased fuel efficiency  increased maintenance costs of revenue equipment in colder weather  and increased insurance and claims costs due to adverse winter weather conditions 
the company attempts to minimize the impact of seasonality through its marketing program by seeking additional freight from certain customers during traditionally slower shipping periods 
bad weather  holidays  and the number of business days during the period can also affect revenue  since revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of trucking companies 
the company estimates the ten largest truckload carriers have less than ten percent of the approximate billion market targeted by the company 
this competition could limit the company s growth opportunities and reduce its profitability 
the company competes primarily with other truckload carriers 
railroads  less than truckload carriers  and private carriers also provide competition  but to a much lesser degree 
competition for the freight transported by the company is based primarily on service and efficiency and  to some degree  on freight rates alone 
the company is sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact customer shipping volumes 
the general slowdown in the economy during had a negative effect on freight volumes for truckload carriers  including the company 
during  freight demand for the company during the last nine months was consistently better than the weaker demand during as the unemployment rate increased during and  driver availability improved for the company and the industry 
fuel prices increased beginning in fourth quarter and were high through and before decreasing in the latter part of due to pending concerns in the middle east and other factors  fuel prices began to rise in the second quarter of  continued to increase throughout the second half of  and increased further in the first part of shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices  or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the company 
to the extent that the company cannot recover the higher cost of fuel through customer fuel surcharges  the company s results would be negatively impacted 
future economic conditions that may affect the company include employment levels  business conditions  fuel and energy costs  interest rates  and tax rates 
the company is regulated by the dot and the federal and provincial transportation departments in canada 
this regulatory authority establishes broad powers  generally governing activities such as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  financial reporting  and other matters 
the company may become subject to new or more comprehensive regulations relating to fuel emissions  driver hours of service  or other issues mandated by the dot  epa  or the federal and provincial transportation departments in canada 
for example  new engine emissions standards became effective for truck engine manufacturers in october these new engines have only recently been available for testing 
at times  there have been shortages of drivers in the trucking industry 
although the market for attracting company drivers improved during and due to the higher domestic unemployment rate and other factors  the company anticipates that the competition for company drivers will continue to be high 
during and continuing into  it became more difficult to recruit and retain owner operator drivers due to the weak used truck pricing market and higher fuel prices for most of the year 
the company anticipates that the competition for company drivers and owner operator drivers will continue to be high and cannot predict whether it will experience shortages in the future 
the company is highly dependent on the services of key personnel including clarence l 
werner and other executive officers 
although the company believes it has an experienced and highly qualified management group  the loss of the services of these executive officers could have a material adverse impact on the company and its future profitability 
the company is dependent on its vendors and suppliers 
the company believes it has good relationships with its vendors and that it is generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors and suppliers 
if the company fails to maintain good relationships with its vendors and suppliers or if its vendors and suppliers experience significant financial problems  the company could face difficulty in obtaining needed goods and services because of interruptions of production or for other reasons  which could adversely affect the company s business 
the efficient operation of the company s business is highly dependent on its information systems 
much of the company s software has been developed internally or by adapting purchased software applications to the company s needs 
the company has purchased redundant computer hardware systems and has its own off site disaster recovery facility approximately ten miles from the company s offices to use in the event of a disaster 
the company has taken these steps to reduce the risk of disruption to its business operation if a disaster were to occur 
the company self insures for liability resulting from cargo loss  personal injury  and property damage as well as workers compensation 
this is supplemented by premium insurance with licensed insurance companies above the company s self insurance level for each type of coverage 
to the extent that the company was to experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost per claim  the company s operating results would be negatively affected 
effective october   all newly manufactured truck engines must comply with the engine emission standards mandated by the environmental protection agency epa 
all truck engines manufactured prior to october  are not subject to these new standards 
for the first time in the company s history  there was inadequate time prior to implementation for the engine manufacturers to provide a sufficient sample of new engines for testing 
the company is testing three types of epa compliant engines 
most of these engines became available for testing during fourth quarter and the first part of these new engines may cause tractor costs to increase  may result in decreased fuel efficiency  may have higher maintenance costs  and may have a shorter engine life 
during werner significantly increased the purchase of trucks with pre october engines to delay the business risk of buying new engines until adequate testing is completed 
this reduced the average age of the company truck fleet from years at december  to years as of december  the company received its remaining deliveries of new trucks with pre october engines from its truck manufacturers in january the company expects its new truck purchases during the rest of the first half of will be minimal 
truck purchases in the second half of will depend on the company s ongoing testing and evaluation of the new engines 
because of truckload carrier concerns with new truck engines and lower industry production of new trucks over the last three years  the resale value of werner s premium used trucks has improved from the historically low values of gains on sales of equipment are reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses in the company s income statement and amounted to a gain of million in compared to a loss of million in  or an improvement of 
per share 
the company expects its used truck pricing may remain better than for the near future 
however  to the extent the company purchases fewer new trucks in  it may have fewer used trucks to sell in the extent of the company s sales of used trucks in will depend on the ongoing testing of the new engines  freight demand  driver availability  and used truck pricing 
caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements made herein  since the statements speak only as of the date they are made

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk the company s only outstanding debt at december   was million of fixed rate debt 
interest rates on the company s unused credit facilities are based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
increases in interest rates could impact the company s annual interest expense on future borrowings 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather  and other market factors 
historically  the company has been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the company cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
the company conducts business in mexico and canada 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to the company s results of operations for and prior years 
accordingly  the company is not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on the company s future costs or on future cash flows 
to date  the company receives payment for freight services performed in mexico and canada primarily in us dollars to reduce foreign currency risk
