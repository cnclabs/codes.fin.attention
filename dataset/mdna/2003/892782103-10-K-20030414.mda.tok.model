critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in these financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
management believes the application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  management has found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
long lived assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  the company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived assets 
due to the continued operating losses independent appraisals are used to determine the appropriateness of the carrying values 
income taxes 
generally accepted accounting principles require that the company record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with the its net operating loss carry forward nol if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize it to offset future taxes 
due to the size of the company s nol in relation to the company s history of unprofitable operations  we have not recognized any of this net deferred tax asset 
the company currently provides for income taxes only to the extent that it expects to pay cash taxes primarily state taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax for current income 
it is possible  however  that the company could operate in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the nol 
upon reaching such a conclusion  the company would record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to its combined federal and state effective rates  which would approximate under current tax rates 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause the provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nol is utilized 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see the company s audited financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles
