the company reported a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of million in compared to losses of million and million in and  respectively 
the pre tax loss from continuing operations in was impacted by the effects of corporate restructuring and other non recurring charges of million 
in  the pre tax loss was reduced by million due to the reversal of a portion of the previously recorded charges 
further discussion on restructuring and other non recurring charges can be found later in this section the truck segment s loss  as defined  decreased to million in from the loss of million reported in  and the loss of million in the truck segment s revenues of  million in were and higher than the  million and the  million reported in and  respectively 
the truck segment s decreased loss and increased revenue in are the result of higher shipments and lower production costs 
the truck segment s loss for was impacted by a number of unusual items including product recall expenses  the inability of a major supplier to supply pre emission engines and costs associated with the six week strike at the company s chatham  ontario heavy truck assembly plant  which totaled approximately million 
during  the company s truck segment was adversely affected by declining overall industry volume as well as reduced truck pricing 

table of contents results of operations continued the engine segment s profit  as defined  of million in was lower than the million reported in  and lower than the million reported in the engine segment s revenues were  million in  a increase from the  million in and a increase from the  million reported in the decrease in the engine segment s profits is primarily due to start up cost associated with the new l v engine 
however  the new l v and increased overall engine demand are the main drivers behind the increase in revenue 
the decreases in the engine segment s profits and revenues for  as compared to  are primarily the result of lower shipments driven by the continued weakness in the medium truck market and costs related to new development programs 
the financial services segment s profit in was million  which represents a increase over the profit reported in and a increase over the profit in this substantial increase is primarily due to greater gains on sale of receivables 
the profit in was slightly lower than due to lower average retail note  operating lease and serviced wholesale note balances  partially offset by higher gains on the sales of retail note receivables 
the changes in the financial services segment s revenues are primarily due to changes in finance revenue discussed below 
sales and revenues sales and revenues of  million in were higher than the  million in and higher than the  million reported in sales of manufactured products totaled  million in  compared to  million and  million reported in and us and canadian industry sales of class through trucks totaled  units in  which is comparable to the  units in  but lower than the  units in class heavy truck sales totaled  units in which is slightly lower than the  and  units sold in and  respectively 
industry sales of class   and medium trucks  including school buses  totaled  units in  a increase from the  units in  and a decrease from the  units sold in industry sales of school buses  which accounted for of the medium truck market in  were  units in  which was slightly higher than the  units in and the  units in the company s market share in the combined us and canadian class through truck market for was which is an increase from the market share in and comparable to the market share in the company s total engine shipments in reached  units  which is higher than the the  units shipped in and slightly higher than the  units shipped in the increase over prior year was attributable to increased shipments of engines to original equipment manufacturers oems 
shipments of mid range diesel engines by the company to oems during were  units  an increase of from the  units shipped in and a slight increase from the  units shipped in finance and insurance revenue was million for  a increase from the million for and a decrease from revenue of million 
the increase in was primarily due to greater gains on sales of receivables 
the decrease in was primarily due to lower average retail note  operating lease and serviced wholesale note balances 
the company recorded other income of million  million and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents results of operations continued costs and expenses manufacturing gross margin was in  an increase from the in  but a decrease from the in the increase in gross margin compared to is primarily due to improved pricing and cost reduction initiatives included in the plans of restructuring  which are described  in detail  later in this discussion 
the decrease in from was attributable to start up costs related to the introduction of new products 
postretirement benefits expense of million in increased million and million over the million and million in and  respectively 
the increase is a result of higher pension and health care obligations combined with lower return on invested assets  as well as  higher amortization expense due to significant unrecognized actuarial losses in and these increases were partially offset by the effects of a required change in how certain cumulative gains and losses are amortized into income 
in fiscal  due to the plan of restructuring initiatives substantially all of the participants in the company s pension plans became inactive 
accordingly  cumulative unrecognized gains and losses related to pension benefits will be amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants in the plans  years in in  amortization of unrecognized gains and losses was amortized over the future years of expected service of active employees of years 
the change in amortization period reduced pension expenses by million in in  amortization expense related to pensions was million while the amortization for other benefit plans was million 
the unrecognized actuarial net losses related to pension benefits were  million   million and million  respectively  as of october   and unrecognized net losses related to other benefits were  million   million and million  respectively  as of october   and engineering and research expense in was million 
this is a decrease from the million in and a decrease from the million reported in the decrease in primarily relates to completion of new products and controlled spending 
the increase in over reflects an increase in spending on development programs and new plant initiatives  partially offset by a reduction in the amount of spending on the company s high performance vehicle hpv and next generation diesel ngd programs 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense of million in is lower than the million in and lower than the million reported in the decrease in is due to continued focus on reducing expenses 
the decrease in compared to is due to a reduction in the provision for losses on receivables of million and the result of increased focus on reducing sg a expenses 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in and million in the decrease in and is primarily due to lower average receivable funding requirements and lower average interest rates 
other expense totaled million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease for and over is due to lower finance charges on sold receivables

there is no limit to the potential amount of future payments required under this agreement  which is scheduled to expire in november as security for its obligation under this agreement  nfc has escrowed million  which will become available for use in february management believes the carrying amount of the liability is adequate to cover any future potential payments 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources continued the company and international are obligated under certain agreements with public and private lenders of nfc to maintain the subsidiary s income before interest expense and income taxes at not less than of its total interest expense

simultaneous with the issuance of the convertible bonds  the company entered into two call option derivative contracts  the consequences of which will allow the company to eliminate share dilution upon conversion of the convertible debt from the conversion price of the bond up to a premium over the share price at issuance 
in february  million of the net proceeds from the million offering was used to repay the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due february the remaining funds were used to repay other existing debt  replenish cash balances that were used to repay other debt that matured in fiscal and to pay fees and expenses related to the offering 
it is the opinion of management that  in the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands  current and forecasted cash flow as well as available financing actions will provide sufficient funds to meet operating requirements and capital expenditures 
currently  under the limitations in various debt agreements  the manufacturing operations are generally unable to incur material amounts of additional debt 
the manufacturing operations are generally allowed under these limitations to refinance their debt as it matures 
management believes that collections on the outstanding receivables portfolios as well as funds available from various funding sources will permit the financial services operations to meet the financing requirements of international s dealers and retail customers 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources continued pension and other postretirement benefits generally  the company s pension plans are non contributory 
the company s policy is to fund its pension plans in accordance with applicable us and canadian government regulations and to make additional payments as funds are available to achieve full funding of the accumulated benefit obligation 
at october   all legal funding requirements had been met 
the company contributed million to its pension plans in and million in in  the company expects to contribute approximately million to its pension plans to meet legal requirements 
other benefits obligations are primarily funded in accordance with the legal agreement  which governs the veba which currently requires the company to fund a portion of the plan s annual service cost 
funded status is derived by subtracting the value of the projected benefit obligations at october  from the end of year fair value of plan assets 
the funded status of the pension benefits deteriorated from million at the end of to million at the end of this decline was primarily due to actuarial losses of million  payments to plan beneficiaries of million  offset by positive returns on plan assets of million and company contributions of million  and a decrease in projected plan obligations of million due to the reversal of a portion of a curtailment loss related to the plans of restructuring 
the funded status of the other benefits deteriorated from  million at the end of to  million at the end of this decline was primarily due to actuarial losses of million  payments to plan beneficiaries of million  offset by positive returns on plan assets of million 
changes in management s assumptions used by the actuaries will have an impact on postretirement benefits expense and the projected benefit obligation 
a basis point change in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately million and other benefits expense by approximately million annually 
the impact of a change of basis points in the discount rate would increase decrease the obligation for pension benefits by approximately million and the obligation for other benefits by million 
a change in the expected return on assets of basis points would increase decrease pension expense by million and other benefits expense by million annually 

table of contents environmental matters the company has been named a potentially responsible party prp  in conjunction with other parties  in a number of cases arising under an environmental protection law  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  popularly known as the superfund law 
these cases involve sites that allegedly have received wastes from current or former company locations 
based on information available to the company which  in most cases  consists of data related to quantities and characteristics of material generated at  or shipped to  each site as well as cost estimates from prps and or federal or state regulatory agencies for the cleanup of these sites  a reasonable estimate is calculated of the company s share  if any  of the probable costs and is provided for in the financial statements 
these obligations are generally recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and are not discounted to their present value 
the company reviews its accruals on a regular basis and believes that  based on these calculations  its share of the potential additional costs for the cleanup of each site will not have a material effect on the company s financial results 
derivative financial instruments the company documents and accounts for derivative and hedging activities in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company recognizes all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial condition and measures them at fair value 
when certain criteria are met  it also provides for matching the timing of gain or loss recognition on the derivative hedging instrument with the recognition of a changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk or b the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction 
changes in the fair value of derivatives which are not designated as  or which do not qualify as  hedges for accounting purposes are reported in earnings in the period in which they occur 
the call option derivative contracts entered into in connection with the issuance of million senior convertible notes in december are recorded in permanent equity in accordance with eitf accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
as disclosed in notes and to the financial statements  the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to interest rate volatility and potentially increase the return on invested funds 
the company s manufacturing operations  as conditions warrant  hedge foreign exchange exposure on the purchase of parts and materials from foreign countries and its exposure from the sale of manufactured products in other countries 
contracted purchases of commodities or manufacturing equipment may also be hedged 
the financial services operations may use forward contracts to hedge future interest payments on the notes and certificates related to an expected sale of receivables 
the financial services operations also use interest rate swaps or caps to reduce exposure to interest rate changes 
table of contents critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the significant accounting principles which management believes are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are included below 
management also believes that all of the accounting policies are important to investors 
therefore  see the notes to the financial statements for a more detailed description of these and other accounting policies of the company 
sales allowances at the time of sale  the company records as a reduction of revenue the estimated impact of sales allowances in the form of dealer and customer incentives 
there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time 
this estimate is based upon the assumption that a certain number of vehicles in dealer stock will have a specific incentive applied against them 
if the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate  or if a different mix of incentives occurs  the sales allowances could be affected 
sales of receivables nfc securitizes finance receivables through qualified special purpose entities qspes  which then issue securities to public and private investors 
nfc sells receivables to the qspes with limited recourse 
gains or losses on sales of receivables are credited or charged to finance revenue in the periods in which the sales occur 
retained interests  which include interest only receivables  cash reserve accounts and subordinated certificates  are recorded at fair value in the periods in which the sales occur 
management estimates the prepayment speed for the receivables sold and the discount rate used to present value the interest only receivable in order to calculate the gain or loss 
estimates of prepayment speeds and discount rates are based on historical experience and other factors and are made separately for each securitization transaction 
in addition  nfc estimates the fair value of the interest only receivable on a quarterly basis 
the fair value of the interest only receivable is based on updated estimates of prepayment speeds and discount rates 
product warranty provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information about the nature  frequency  and average cost of warranty claims 
management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve vehicle quality and minimize warranty claims 
management believes that the warranty reserve is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
product liability the company is subject to product liability lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business 
to the extent permitted under applicable law  the company maintains insurance to reduce the risk to the company 
most insurance coverage includes self insured retention 
the company records product 
table of contents critical accounting policies continued product liability continued liability reserves for the self insured portion of any pending or threatened product liability actions 
the reserve is based upon two estimates 
first  management determines an appropriate case specific reserve based upon management s best judgment and the advice of legal counsel 
these estimates are continually evaluated and adjusted based upon changes in facts or circumstances surrounding the case 
second  management obtains a third party actuarial analysis to determine the amount of additional reserve required to cover certain known claims and all incurred but not reported product liability issues 
based upon this process management believes that the product liability reserve is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred and the actual settlement values of outstanding claims may differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company provides postretirement benefits to a substantial portion of its employees 
costs associated with postretirement benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees  retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 
the company s employee pension and postretirement heath care expenses are dependent on management s assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  long term return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the company s approach to establishing the discount rate assumption reflects an investment strategy that effectively settles a portion of its pension liability by investing in a bond portfolio that generates monthly cash flows equal to the projected monthly benefits 
this portion of the liability is weighted using a discount rate based on the october  effective yield on the dedicated bond investment portfolio 
the remaining non dedicated portion of the liability used the average of the october  yields on the merrill lynch ten year high quality corporate bond index and moody s aa corporate bond index  both adjusted for an incremental yield of approximately basis points that is achieved by selecting bonds whose credit characteristics satisfy the quality requirements eg aa aa or better but whose yields are slightly higher than the normal bonds that comprise the index 
for the other benefits  the discount rate is based on the merrill lynch ten year high quality corporate bond index and moody s aa corporate bond index with a provision for an incremental yield 
based on this approach  at october   the company lowered the discount rate for pension plans to from at october  the discount rate for the other benefits was lowered from at october  to at october  the company determines its expected return on plan asset assumptions by evaluating both historical returns as well as estimates of future returns 
specifically  the company analyzed the average historical broad market returns for various periods of time over the past years for equities and over a year period for fixed income securities  adjusted these returns for a premium due to the active management of its investment funds  and adjusted the computed amount for any expected changes in the long term outlook for the equity and fixed income markets 
the company s expected return on assets was based on expected equity and fixed income returns weighted by the percentage of assets allocated to each plan

allowance for losses the allowance for losses reflects management s estimate of the losses inherent in financial services portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases 
the allowance is maintained at an amount management considers appropriate in relation to the outstanding portfolio based on factors such as overall portfolio credit risk quality  historical loss experience and current economic conditions 
these factors require management judgment  and different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in changes to the allowance for losses

financial services losses are net of these benefits 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of  including other intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
this review is performed using estimates of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of such cash flows and fair value could affect the evaluations

income taxes the statement of financial condition at october   includes a deferred tax asset of  million  net of valuation allowances of million 
the deferred tax asset at october   of  million is net of valuation allowances of million 
the deferred tax asset has been reduced by the valuation allowance  as management believes it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized in the future 
the deferred tax asset at october   includes the tax benefit from cumulative tax net operating losses nol of  million  cumulative alternative minimum tax and research and development credits of million and cumulative expenses of  million that have not been deducted on the company s tax returns 
the company has no open tax years that are currently under audit by the internal revenue service irs  and management believes that it is unlikely the irs would limit utilization of the nols 
until the company has utilized its significant nol carryforwards and credits  the cash payment of us federal income taxes will be minimal 
see note to the financial statements 
the company performs extensive analysis to determine the amount of the net deferred tax asset 
such analysis is based on the premise that the company is  and will continue to be  a going concern and that it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
management reviews all available evidence  both positive and negative  to assess the 
table of contents income taxes continued long term earnings potential of the company 
the financial results are evaluated using a number of alternatives in economic cycles at various industry volume conditions 
one significant factor considered is the company s role as a leading producer of heavy and medium trucks and school buses and mid range diesel engines 
realization of the cumulative deferred tax asset  net of liabilities  is dependent on the generation of approximately  million of future taxable income 
management believes that  with the combination of available tax planning strategies and the maintenance of significant truck and engine market share  sufficient earnings are achievable in order to realize the deferred tax asset  net of liabilities  of  million 
currently there is no annual limitation on the company s ability to use nols to reduce future income taxes 
however  if an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  occurs with respect to the company s capital stock  it would limit the use of nols to specific annual amounts 
generally  an ownership change occurs if certain persons or groups increase their aggregate ownership by more than percentage points of the company s total capital stock in any three year period 
if an ownership change occurs  the company s ability to use domestic nols to reduce income taxes is limited to an annual amount based on the fair market value of the company immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt interest rate published monthly by the irs 
currently the company s change in ownership percentage is minimal 
reconciliation of the company s income loss before income taxes from continuing operations for financial statement purposes to us taxable income loss for the years ended october is as follows millions of dollars income loss from continuing operations before income taxes exclusion of income loss of foreign subsidiaries state income taxes temporary differences permanent differences us taxable income loss business environment sales of class through trucks have historically been cyclical  with demand affected by such economic factors as industrial production  construction  demand for consumer durable goods  interest rates and the earnings and cash flow of dealers and customers 
truck sales in were hindered by a number of factors including the overall state of the economy  rising insurance costs  tightened credit availability and increased fuel prices 
the company s us and canadian order backlog at october   is  units  consistent with october  historically  retail deliveries have been impacted by the rate at which new truck orders are received 
therefore  in order to manage through the current downturn  the company continually evaluates order receipts and backlog throughout the year by balancing production with demand as appropriate 

table of contents business environment continued the company currently projects us and canadian class heavy truck demand to be  units  up from class and medium truck demand  excluding school buses  is forecast at  units  higher than in demand for school buses is expected to be  units  consistent with mid range diesel engine shipments by the company to oems in are expected to be  units  higher than in may  the company announced that as a result of discussions with the national automobile  aerospace and agricultural implement workers of canada  or caw  it has reached a conditional understanding on a plan that would keep the company s chatham  ontario heavy truck assembly plant open if certain financial and operating conditions were met including obtaining financial support from the government of canada and the province of ontario

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the company is also exposed to changes in the prices of commodities used in its manufacturing operations and to changes in the prices of equity instruments owned by the company 
commodity price risk related to the company s current commodity financial instruments and equity price risk related to the company s current investments in equity instruments are not material 
the company does not hold a material portfolio of market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the company has established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate market risk 
these procedures include the monitoring of the company s level of exposure to each market risk  the funding of variable rate receivables primarily with variable rate debt  and limiting the amount of fixed rate receivables which may be funded with floating rate debt 
these procedures also include the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations and to reduce the company s exposure to exchange rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that the company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
the company measures its interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
assuming a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in interest rates as of october  and  the net fair value of these instruments would decrease by approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in interest rate yield curves 
the model  therefore  does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates 
foreign currency risk is the risk that the company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposures to foreign currency exchange fluctuations are the canadian dollar us dollar  mexican dollar us dollar and brazilian real us dollar 
at october  and  the potential reduction in future earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive instruments would be approximately million 
the foreign currency sensitivity model is limited by the assumption that all of the foreign currencies to which the company is exposed would simultaneously decrease by because such synchronized changes are unlikely to occur 
the effects of foreign currency forward contracts have been included in the above analysis  however  the sensitivity model does not include the inherent risks associated with the anticipated future transactions denominated in foreign currency for which these forward contracts have been entered into for hedging purposes
