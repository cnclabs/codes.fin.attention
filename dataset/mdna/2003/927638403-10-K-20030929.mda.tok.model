among the uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from our projections are whether we are able to secure sufficient funding to maintain our operations  complete clinical trials and successfully market our product  whether our stock price will enable us to conduct future financings  whether the efficacy  price and timing of our natural human alpha interferon will enable us to compete with other well established  highly capitalized  biopharmaceutical companies  whether clinical testing confirms the efficacy of our product  and results in the receipt of regulatory approvals 
we have not sought the approval of our natural human alpha interferon product from the us food and drug administration or its european union counterparts  except sweden  whether our patent applications result in the issuance of patents  or whether patents and other intellectual property rights provide adequate protections in the event of misappropriation or infringement by third parties  whether our avian transgenics program will succeed in being able to produce targeted drugs in egg whites of transgenic chickens in commercially viable quantities  whether  despite receipt of regulatory approvals  our products are accepted as a treatment superior to that of our competitors  and whether we can generate revenue sufficient to offset our historical losses and achieve profitability 

table of contents our natural human alpha interferon product was developed and is manufactured overseas in our swedish facility 
our avian transgenic and oncology programs are also being researched and developed in europe 
our dependence on foreign manufacturing and expected international sales exposes us to a number of risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  including import and export restrictions  political or economic instability  compliance with foreign laws  transportation delays and interruptions  difficulties in protecting intellectual property rights in foreign countries  and currency exchange risks

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  depreciation  amortization  asset valuation allowances  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
consolidation 
our consolidated financial statements include the results of viragen  inc and all of its subsidiaries  including those operating outside the united states 
all significant transactions among our businesses have been eliminated 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using foreign exchange rates as of the balance sheet date

translation adjustments are included in the balance sheet under accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of stockholders equity 
inventories 
inventories consist of raw materials and supplies  work in process and finished product 
finished product consists of purified natural human alpha interferon 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market estimated net realizable value 
raw materials and supplies cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
work in process and finished product costs consisting of raw materials  labor and overhead are recorded at a standard cost which approximates actual cost 
excess idle capacity costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
if the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value  provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value 
these provisions are determined based on estimates 
long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flows 
if these estimated future cash flows are less 
table of contents than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its carrying value 
as of the date of these financial statements  we are not aware of any items or events that would cause us to adjust the recorded value of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment 
goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment arise 
all of our goodwill arose from the acquisition of viranative in september and the subsequent achievement of certain milestones defined in the acquisition agreement 
we periodically evaluate that acquired business for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions  and operational performance of our acquired business 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment review of our goodwill with the assistance of an independent valuation firm 
the impairment review indicated that our goodwill was not impaired 
future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review  including revenue projections or market values could cause our analysis to indicate that our goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write off of a portion or all of our goodwill

table of contents manufacturing of our natural human alpha interferon at our leased facility in umea  sweden  has been suspended since march  this planned break in routine manufacturing is necessary to allow for certain steps of the production process to be segregated and transferred to our owned facility which is also located in umea  sweden 
the need for the renovation of our owned facility has been discussed with the swedish medical product authority mpa and it has been agreed that this is a mandatory requirement 
we remain in communication with the mpa on the final design of this facility and on the implementation of production activities 
renovation of this facility commenced in and is in line with our plan to expand our productive capacity of our natural human alpha interferon 
the estimated total cost of this initial phase is million and it is scheduled to be completed by the first quarter of we believe that our current inventory levels are sufficient to meet our current sales forecasts during the period which routine production is planned to be suspended 
we plan to expand the use of our owned facility in phases based on product demand and available financing 
maximum expansion  if warranted  could cost up to an additional million 
we believe that our natural human alpha interferon product can be manufactured in sufficient quantity and be priced at a level to offer patients an attractive alternative treatment to the synthetic interferons currently being marketed 
however  we can not assure you of the success of our commercialization efforts and other projects 
required regulatory approvals are subject to the successful completion of lengthy and costly clinical trials 
the successful commercialization of multiferon and the completion of required clinical trials and facility expansions depend on our ability to raise significant additional funding 
while subject to significant limitation  viragen at june   has available approximately million in net tax operating loss carryforwards expiring between and  which may be used to offset taxable income  if any  during those periods 
our ability to generate revenue during future periods is dependent upon obtaining regulatory approvals for commercialization of our different projects 
as we cannot determine that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals  we are unable to conclude that realization of benefits from our deferred tax assets is more likely than not  as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
as a result  we have recognized a valuation allowance to offset of the deferred tax assets related to these carryforwards 
we estimate that we will require funding of approximately million over the next two years 
these funds would be used to fund operations including clinical trials 
we will also use planned future funding for continued product development  general working capital purposes  including administrative support functions  and possible equity investments in businesses complementary to our operations 
results of operations compared to product sales and cost of sales as a result of our acquisition of viranative on september   we began recognizing revenue through the sale of our natural human alpha interferon product 
since the date of the acquisition  a significant portion of our product sales have been for the sale of bulk product semi purified to a customer in italy  alfa wasserman  under a contractual arrangement  which has expired 
for the fiscal year ended june   bulk product sales totaled approximately  or approximately of total product sales 
product sales for the nine months ended june  consisted solely of sales of our purified natural human alpha interferon product and we expect to continue selling only purified natural human alpha interferon in the future 

table of contents for the fiscal year ended june   product sales totaled approximately  compared to product sales of approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in product sales of approximately  for the twelve months ended june  are primarily attributed to the absence of sales of bulk product to alfa wasserman under a contractual arrangement which has expired 
prior year s results of operations for the twelve months ended june  included our swedish subsidiary s results only for the nine months ended june  as it was acquired on september  cost of sales and excess idle production costs totaled approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in cost of sales and the resulting negative margins are attributed to excess idle capacity costs 
excess idle capacity costs represent fixed production costs incurred at our swedish manufacturing facility  which were not absorbed as a result of reduced production levels 
research and development costs research and development costs include scientific salaries and support fees  laboratory supplies  consulting fees  contracted research and development  equipment rentals  repairs and maintenance  utilities and research related travel 
research and development costs for the fiscal year ended june  totaled approximately  a decrease of approximately  when compared to the previous fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily attributed to cost reductions in our scottish facility related to the termination of our development efforts on our omniferon product of approximately  and a decrease in consulting fees related to oncology projects totaling approximately  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in contracted research and development totaling approximately  related to our avian transgenics project 
we expect our overall research and development costs to decrease as we focus our efforts on containing costs and directing resources to priority programs 
we will continue incurring research and development costs for additional clinical trial projects associated with multiferon as well as other projects to more fully develop potential commercial applications of our natural human alpha interferon product  as well as broaden our potential product lines in the areas of avian transgenics and oncology 
our ability to successfully conclude additional clinical trials  a prerequisite for expanded commercialization of any product  is dependent upon our ability to raise significant additional funding 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include administrative personnel salaries and related expenses  lease expenses  utilities  repairs and maintenance  insurance  legal  accounting  consulting fees  depreciation and amortization 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to approximately  for the preceding fiscal year 
this increase of  is mainly attributed to additional expenses incurred by our swedish subsidiary of approximately  which was acquired in september prior year s results of operations for the twelve months ended june  included our swedish subsidiary s results only for the nine months ended june  as it was acquired on september  also contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended june  were increases in payroll related expenses  consulting fees  insurance expense and royalties expense at our florida headquarters totaling approximately    and  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in legal fees at our florida headquarters totaling approximately  this decrease in legal fees reflected the termination of litigation with avigenics conducted primarily in fiscal we expect our overall selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease in the foreseeable future as a result of cost cutting efforts to reduce overall administrative expenses  which will be partially offset by additional costs related to the commercialization of multiferon 
our successful commercialization of multiferon will require additional marketing and promotional activities which is dependent upon our ability to raise significant additional funding 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of the purchase price allocated to separately identified intangible assets obtained in the acquisition of viranative in september the separately identified intangible assets consist of developed technology and a customer contract 
the developed technology is being amortized over its estimated useful life of approximately years 
the customer contract was amortized over the term of the contract  which expired in december for the fiscal year ended june   amortization of intangible assets totaled approximately  interest and other income the primary components of interest and other income are interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  grant income from a government agency in scotland  sublease income on certain office space in our facility in scotland and gains or losses on foreign exchange  and gains or losses on the disposal of property and equipment 
interest and other income totaled approximately  for the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of approximately  when compared to the same period of the preceding year 
this increase is attributed to additional grant and sublease income totaling approximately  and  for the twelve months ended june   respectively 
however  this increase was partially offset by reductions in principal invested between the periods and decreased interest rates available between periods resulting in a decrease in interest income of approximately  and a decrease in gains on foreign exchange totaling approximately  interest expense interest expense for the twelve months ended june  totaling approximately  primarily represents non cash interest expense on our convertible debentures of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  this non cash expense consists of amortization of deferred financing costs and amortization of the discounts on the debentures  which arose from detachable warrants and shares of common stock issued with the debentures  as well as the debentures beneficial conversion feature 
also included in interest expense is interest incurred on the debt facilities maintained by our swedish subsidiary 
these credit facilities have interest rates ranging from to

these jurisdictions have different marginal tax rates 
for the year ended june   income tax benefit totaled approximately  a decrease of approximately  when compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year 
this decrease is primarily attributed to the absence of tax credits from research and development activities in scotland totaling approximately  for the year ended june  income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  is primarily related to the amortization expense on certain intangible assets 
due to the treatment of the identifiable intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  our balance sheet reflects a deferred tax liability of approximately  as of june  all of which is related to our developed technology intangible asset acquired in september based on our accumulated losses  a full valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses totaled approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  compared with approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  this increase of approximately  was attributable to administrative expenses incurred by our swedish subsidiary of approximately  which was acquired in september also contributing to the increase in selling general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended june   are increases totaling approximately  at our florida headquarters composed of increases of approximately  and  related to legal fees and compensation on options and warrants granted to consultants  respectively 
the increases at our florida headquarters were offset in part by a decrease in consulting fees totaling approximately  in addition  during the fiscal year ended june   our scottish subsidiary experienced increases in selling  general and administrative expenses totaling approximately  and  related to professional fees and facility lease expense  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of the purchase price allocated to separately identified intangible assets obtained in the acquisition of viranative in september consisting of developed technology and a customer contract 
for the fiscal year ended june   amortization of intangible assets totaled approximately  there was no amortization of intangibles assets during fiscal interest and other income the decrease in interest and other income of approximately  during the fiscal year ended june  is attributed to the decrease in principal invested between the periods  decreased interest rates available between periods and the absence of a gain upon the disposal of fixed assets which was included in the twelve month period ended june  
table of contents interest expense the significant increase in interest expense totaling approximately  for the twelve months ended june   is primarily attributable to approximately  of non cash interest expense on the convertible debentures which were issued in january interest expense for the twelve months ended june   includes interest accrued on the debentures  amortization of deferred financing costs and amortization of the discount on the debentures resulting from the detachable warrants  additional purchase option and the debentures beneficial conversion feature 
income tax benefit for the year ended june   income tax benefit totaled approximately  this amount consisted of income tax benefits totaling approximately  and  for tax credits from research and development activities in scotland and the amortization expense on certain intangible assets related to the viranative acquisition  respectively 
due to the treatment of the identifiable intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes  we have a net deferred tax liability of approximately  based on our accumulated losses  a valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
as of june   we had a net operating loss carry forward of approximately million for us federal income tax purposes 
research and development projects we have five ongoing research and development projects in the fields of oncology and avian transgenics 
oncology our research and development projects in the field of oncology are focused on the development of therapeutic proteins for the treatment of targeted cancers 
our oncological projects are defined as follow cd therapy in collaboration with cancer research uk  we are developing a monoclonal antibody designed to block the protective effect of the protein cd on the surface of tumor cells 
the protein cd is one of a number of proteins which protect normal healthy cells from being destroyed by the complement system 
the problem arises when cancer cells also express this control protein to camouflage themselves from the immune system at levels up to fold greater than normal 
under a worldwide exclusive commercial license granted to us  we are developing an antibody to remove this protection from tumor cells 
a successful therapy could also offer protection against cancer spreading 
we believe this technology may prove useful in the treatment of colorectal  breast  ovarian and certain bone cancers 
for the fiscal years ended   and  we incurred costs related to the cd project totaling approximately   and  respectively 
since the date of inception of this project  we have incurred approximately  in research and development costs 
the cd vaccine project has not reached clinical trials and we do not expect to enter into clinical trials earlier than third calendar quarter of  if at all 

table of contents iep we entered into an agreement with the university of miami s sylvester comprehensive cancer center to develop anti cancer technology 
the joint project is designed to develop a novel form of an immune enhancing drug that has shown promise by inhibiting tumor growth in rats for a broad range of cancers 
this drug is a novel amino acid peptide called iep  which was derived from a tumor transmembrane glycoprotein 
it possesses anti cancer vaccine properties both prophylactically and therapeutically 
for the fiscal year ended we incurred costs related to the iep project totaling approximately  since the date of inception of this project  we have incurred approximately  in research and development costs 
it is too early too determine if and when this project will make it to clinical trials 
r monoclonal antibody in collaboration with memorial sloan kettering cancer center  we have initiated research on monoclonal antibodies targeting ganglioside gd for the treatment of melanoma and possibly certain other cancers 
monoclonal antibodies are laboratory produced  highly specialized therapeutic proteins designed to locate and bind to targeted cancer cells 
for the fiscal years ended   and  we incurred costs related to the r project totaling approximately   and  respectively 
since the date of inception of this project  we have incurred approximately  in research and development costs 
based on ongoing laboratory results  and our recent cost cutting program  further development of this project has been put on hold pending further review of compiled data 
notch monoclonal antibody under a worldwide exclusive license from the us national institutes of health nih  we were researching the clinical applications of a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the notch protein 
binding of the antibody to the protein signals the immune response to activate lymphocytes  modulating immunity 
the antibody may also be useful in adjuvant therapies 
during fiscal  we suspended research and related expenditures on this project to explore scientific issues related to the license form the nih 
subsequent to our fiscal year end  we terminated the license 
for the fiscal years ended   and  we incurred costs related to the notch project totaling approximately   and  respectively 
since the date of inception of this project  we have incurred approximately  in research and development costs 
estimated completion dates  completion costs  and future material net cash inflows  if any  for the above oncological projects are not reasonably certain and are not determinable at this time 
the timelines and associated costs for the completion of biopharmaceutical research and product development programs are difficult to accurately predict for various reasons  including the inherent exploratory nature of the work 
the achievement of project milestones is dependent on issues which may impact development timelines and can be unpredictable and beyond viragen s control 
these issues include  availability of capital funding  presence of competing technologies  unexpected experimental results which may cause the direction of research to change  accumulated knowledge about the intrinsic properties of the candidate product  the availability of contract cell banking and manufacturing slots for the preparation of good manufacturing practices grade material  results from preclinical and clinical studies  potential changes in prescribing practice and patient profiles and regulatory requirements 

table of contents avian transgenics our avian transgenic project is designed to enable viragen to produce protein based drugs  including monoclonal antibodies  inside the egg whites of transgenic developed chickens 
our goal is to develop a technology which will enable us to meet the large scale production requirements for our own therapeutic protein products 
we also believe that this technology will allow us to offer to others in the biopharmaceutical industry an alternate faster method of production of their protein based products with a higher capacity and at a lower cost 
avian transgenics offers a potential solution to the production bottleneck currently limiting the growth and contributing to the high cost of protein drugs 
existing protein production technologies are often inefficient and costly 
in addition  the anticipated explosion in protein drug approvals together with protein based drugs in pre clinical and phase i or phase ii clinical trials has created a worldwide shortage of production capacity for these protein based products 
we believe our avian transgenics project will offer a rapid and cost effective way to produce large volumes of therapeutic proteins 
in addition to meeting the current and future alternative production demands of the biopharmaceutical industry and generating significant revenue for viragen  this project could also accelerate the progress of several life saving drugs to the market at an affordable cost 
for the fiscal years ended   and  we incurred costs related to the avian transgenics project totaling approximately   and  respectively 
since the date of inception of this project  we have incurred approximately  in research and development costs 
we estimate that we may be able to begin commercialization of our avian transgenics technology during calendar year however  it should be noted that additional work is necessary to be able to express the targeted proteins in the egg whites of transgenic chickens in sufficient quantities to make the process commercially viable 
there can be no assurance as to if  or when  this target will be met 
additional costs to be incurred through commercialization are estimated at million to million 
future material net cash inflows  if any  are not reasonably certain and are not determinable at this time 
this is a new technology and there is no precedent to be used to estimate the size of the potential market or the demand for this technology 
the completion of all of the above research and development projects is dependent upon our ability to raise significant additional funding or our ability to identify potential collaborative partners that would share in project costs 
our future capital requirements are dependent upon many factors  including revenue generated from the sale of our natural human alpha interferon product  progress with future clinical trials  the costs associated with obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in patent applications  competing technologies and market developments  and our ability to establish collaborative arrangements and effective commercialization activities 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have not traded or otherwise transacted in derivatives nor do we expect to do so in the future 
we have established policies and internal processes related to the management of market risks which we use in the normal course of our business operations 
interest rate risk the fair value of long term debt is subject to interest rate risk 
while changes in market interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt  we believe a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition  future results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct operations in several different countries 
the balance sheet accounts of our operations in scotland and sweden are translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes and resulting adjustments are made to stockholders equity 
the value of the respective local currency may strengthen or weaken against the us dollar  which would impact the value of stockholders investment in our common stock 
fluctuations in the value of the british pound and swedish krona against the us dollar have occurred during our history  which have resulted in unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses  which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and shown in the equity section of our balance sheet 
while most of the transactions of our us and foreign operations are denominated in the respective local currency  some transactions are denominated in other currencies 
since the accounting records of our foreign operations are kept in the respective local currency  any transactions denominated in other currencies are accounted for in the respective local currency at the time of the transaction 
upon settlement of such a transaction  any foreign currency gain or loss results in an adjustment to income 
our results of operations may be impacted by the fluctuating exchange rates of foreign currencies  especially the british pound and swedish krona  in relation to the us dollar 
most of the revenue and expense items of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the respective local currency 
an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the foreign currency against the us dollar will result in lower revenue when translated into us dollars 
operating expenses would also be lower in these circumstances 
during fiscal year  the us dollar has experienced adverse fluctuations against the british pound and the swedish krona 
based on the foreign currency exchange rates as of june  the us dollar has lost approximately and of its value against the british pound and swedish krona  respectively  since june  the weakening of the us dollar has resulted in greater operating expenses  revenues  assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries when translated to us dollars 
we believe our foreign currency risk is not significant 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities with respect to our foreign currency exposure 
however  we continually monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 
we have not incurred significant realized losses on exchange transactions 
if realized losses on foreign transactions were to become significant  we would evaluate appropriate strategies  including the possible use of foreign exchange contracts  to reduce such losses 
we were not adversely impacted by the european union s adoption of the euro currency 
our foreign operations to date have been located in scotland and sweden  which did not participate in the adoption of the euro
