gross billings refers to amounts billed to our clients for advertising placed on the internet  in newspapers and telephone directories and associated fees for related services  such as access to monster s resume database 
in addition  fees for professional and executive staffing services and net fees for temporary contracting services net of temporary contractor costs are also part of gross billings 
gross billings and related costs for recruitment advertising and yellow page advertising  placed by our advertising communications and directional marketing businesses respectively  are not shown separately in our consolidated financial statements because they include a substantial amount of funds that are collected from our clients but passed through to publishers for advertisements 
however  the trends in gross billings in these two segments directly impact the commissions and fees that they earn because  for these segments  we earn commissions based on a percentage of the media advertising purchased at a rate established by the related publisher 
publishers and third party websites typically bill us for the advertising purchased and we in turn bill our clients for this amount and retain a commission 
generally  the payment terms for directional marketing clients require payment to us prior to the date payment is due to the publishers 
the payment terms with advertising communications clients typically require payment when payment is due to publishers 
historically  we have not experienced substantial problems with unpaid accounts

our directional marketing division designs and executes yellow page advertising  resulting in an effective gross margin rate which approximated of yellow page media billings in and in both and in addition to base commissions  certain yellow pages publishers pay incentive commissions for increased annual volume of advertising placed by advertising agencies

critical accounting policies and items affecting comparability quality financial reporting relies on consistent application of company accounting policies that are based on generally accepted accounting principles 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial statements and often require management judgment and estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
although our commissions and fees recognition policy contains a relatively low level of uncertainty  it does require judgment on complex matters that are subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance

direct operating costs incurred that relate to future commissions and fees for yellow page advertisements  are deferred recorded as work in process in the consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently charged to expense when the directories are closed for publication and the related commission is recognized as income

revenue consists of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients 
for each assignment  we enter into a contract with our clients that outlines the general terms and conditions of the assignment 
typically  we are paid a retainer for our executive and management search services equal to approximately one third of the estimated guaranteed first year compensation for the position to be filled 
in addition  if the actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation  we often will be authorized to bill the client for one third of the excess 
indirect expenses are calculated as a percentage of the retainer with certain dollar limits per search 
we generally bill our clients for their retainer and indirect expenses in one third increments over a three month period commencing in the month of acceptance of the contract by the client and recognize the revenue over the period 
temporary contracting costs temporary contracting costs include salaries  payroll taxes  employee benefits  travel expenses and insurance costs for temporary contractors who are employees of the company as well as contractor fees and travel expenses for temporary contractors who are independent contractors 
salaries and related expenses consist primarily of salaries  payroll taxes and employee benefits related to recruitment professionals  executive level employees  administrative staff and other employees of the company who are not temporary contractors 
intangibles intangibles represent acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net tangible assets of businesses purchased and consist primarily of the value of client lists  non compete agreements  trademarks and goodwill 
with the exception of goodwill these costs are being amortized over periods ranging from two to thirty years 
in conjunction with our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we evaluate our goodwill annually for impairment  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the determination of whether or not goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of the reporting units 
changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets 
in addition  sfas eliminates the amortization of indefinite lived intangible assets 
results of operations for the twelve months ended december  and include million and million  respectively  of amortization expense that will not continue in future periods as a result of our adoption of sfas see note to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our implementation of sfas in connection with our implementation of sfas  the company has recorded a non cash charge of million  net of tax  at january   which has been reflected in our consolidated statement of operations as a cumulative effect of accounting change for the year ended december  the company has adopted a policy to review each reporting unit for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach that uses forward looking information regarding market share  revenues and costs for each reporting unit as well as appropriate discount rates 
as a result  changes in these assumptions and current working capital could materially change the outcome of each reporting unit s fair value determinations in future periods  which could require a further permanent write down of goodwill 
the write down of goodwill shown as a cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax  in our consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended december  was determined using the forward looking information that was available to us on january  in the fourth quarter of  the company again reviewed each reporting unit for impairment  taking into consideration the spin off transaction and business reorganization initiatives in  and no further impairment was identified 
the company will continue to evaluate its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the estimates that we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying business 
if we fail to achieve our estimates of market share or if labor markets fail to improve  we may incur further charges for impairment of goodwill 
long lived assets with the exception of goodwill  long lived assets such as intangibles and property and equipment  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and their eventual disposition is less than their carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is assessed using discounted cash flows 
merger  integration  restructuring and business reorganization plans we have recorded significant charges and accruals in connection with our merger  integration  restructuring and business reorganization plans 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlement of contractual obligations resulting from our actions 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  service and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables and notes receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
changes in required reserves may occur due to changing circumstances  including changes in the current market environment or in the particular circumstances of individual customers

interim financial reporting as permitted under generally accepted accouting principles  interim accouting for certain expenses  including income taxes and selected marketing and promotion costs are based on full year assumptions 
such amounts are expensed in full in the year incurred 
for interim financial reporting purposes  income taxes are recorded based upon estimated annual income tax rates

the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  gross billings for the year ended december  were  million  a decrease of million or as compared to gross billings of  million for this decrease in gross billings resulted primarily from the effect of the weak economic and labor markets on our monster  advertising communications  eresourcing and executive search divisions  partially offset by an increase of million or in directional marketing traditional gross billings 
the increase in directional marketing gross billings primarily relates to our acquisition of usmotivation in september usmotivation generated total gross billings of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the period following its acquisition in the difficult global economic environment and rise in us unemployment in particular  has had a negative impact on our commissions and fees as our clients hiring needs and related resources diminished throughout and our total commissions and fees for the year ended december  were  million  a decrease of million or versus  million in the largest declines were recognized in our monster  advertising communications  eresourcing and executive search segments that are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the global economic and employment markets 
the period also reflects a benefit from favorable currency exchange rates of million when compared to the prior year 
in our experience  companies have been reluctant to commit extensive resources to their hiring needs at the first sign of economic recovery 
therefore  we expect there to be a time lag between a general economic recovery and improvement in the global labor markets 
interactive commissions and fees include fees earned in connection with recruitment  yellow page and other advertisements placed on the internet  interactive employment searches and temporary contracting services sourced through the internet 
interactive commissions and fees were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or over the same period in largely as a result of the weak global labor markets

total operating expenses for the year ended december  were  million  compared with  million for the decrease of million or is due primarily to cost cutting measures in salaries and related costs  office and general expenses and marketing and promotion that we began implementing near the end of merger integration costs also decreased million as we finalized the integration of our acquisitions accounted for as poolings of interests 
these decreases were mostly offset by our business reorganization and other special charges of million in total operating expenses were also negatively impacted by currency exchange rates  resulting in an increase of million relating to the weakening of the us dollar  compared to the prior period

amortization of intangibles was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the decrease relates to our adoption of sfas as a result  goodwill arising from purchase acquisitions has not been amortized in the current period 
had goodwill not been amortized in the prior period  amortization expense would have been million for the year ended december  as a result of all of the above  operating loss for the year ended december  was million  compared to operating income of million for the comparable period in excluding goodwill amortization  operating income would have been million for the year ended december  net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease of million reflects substantially lower us interest rates in and a significantly lower average cash balance in the twelve months ended december  the benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  was million on a pretax loss of million  compared with a tax expense of million on a pretax profit of million for  resulting in effective tax rates of and  respectively 
the difference in our effective tax rate from to  primarily reflects a tax benefit of million related to our merger and integration costs and business reorganization and other special charges of million 
excluding the effects of those costs  our effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
our effective tax rate  adjusted to exclude merger and integration and business reorganization and other special charges  decreased primarily due to the elimination of non deductible goodwill amortization expense in resulting from the adoption of new accounting standards  and more effective utilization of foreign losses 
in each period  the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate of due to non deductible expenses such as certain merger costs from pooling of interests transactions  state income taxes and differences from the us tax rate in foreign jurisdictions 
a valuation allowance has been recorded principally on losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions where offset against profitable units is not permitted  and in certain start up countries where we have no history of profitability 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas  as of the beginning of fiscal year  we completed a transitional goodwill impairment review for all of our operating segments 
the results of our impairment review indicated that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable 
accordingly  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  net of a million tax benefit  at january  to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its estimated fair value 
this charge is reflected in our statement of operations for the year ended december  as a cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax benefit 
in the fourth quarter of  we again reviewed each reporting unit for impairment  taking into consideration the spin off transaction and business reorganization initiatives in  and no further impairment was identified 
according to our policy and under the new rules  we will perform a similar review annually  or sooner if indicators of potential impairment exist 
our impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses our estimates of market share  revenues and costs for each operating segment as well as appropriate discount rates 
the estimates that we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying business 
if we fail to achieve our estimates of market share or if labor markets fail to improve  we may incur further charges for impairment of goodwill 
as a result of the above  our net loss was million for the year ended december   or per diluted share compared with net income of million or per diluted share for the prior period 
net income and earnings per share for  adjusted to exclude the effects of goodwill amortization in the year ended december   were million and  respectively

our cash generated from operating activities is subject to fluctuations in the global economy  unemployment rates and the demand for yellow pages advertising 
we have entered into various commitments  particularly non cancelable operating and capital leases for our facilities worldwide 
future minimum lease payments under these commitments as of december  are as follows amounts in thousands capital leases operating leases thereafter  recent accounting pronouncements as of january   we adopted sfas  which addresses the financial reporting standards for the acquisition of intangible assets outside of a business combination and for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
this accounting standard requires that goodwill and indefinite lived assets are no longer amortized but tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances warrant 
the provisions of the standard also require the completion of a transitional impairment test in the year of adoption  with any impairment identified upon initial implementation treated as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting standards for goodwill  we have completed the transitional goodwill impairment review 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses our estimates of future market share  revenues and costs for each reporting unit as well as appropriate discount rates 
as a result of the adoption of sfas  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million  net of a million tax benefit  to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill as of january  in october  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment of disposal or long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount of fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
therefore  discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and  generally  is to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of sfas in fiscal did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities can include eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts  and relocating plant facilities or personnel

sfas requires the company to disclose information about its exit and disposal activities  the related costs  and changes in those costs in the notes to the interim and annual financial statements that include the period in which an exit activity is initiated and in all subsequent period until the activity is completed 
sfas is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
under sfas  a company may not restate its previously issued financial statements 
we intend to adopt sfas for disposal activities initiated after december  liabilities recognized as a result of disposal activities prior to the adoption of sfas no 
will continue to be accounted for under emerging issues task force issue no

is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
the objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and results of operations of a vie need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate the entity if the company s interest in the vie is such that the company will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  if they occur 
interpretation no 
also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
the provisions of this interpretation became effective upon issuance 
the company does not expect this interpretation to have an effect on its consolidated financial statements
