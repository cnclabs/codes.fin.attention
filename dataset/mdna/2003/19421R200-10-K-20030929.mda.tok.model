item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in determining the fair value of some of our assets  principally accounts receivable  inventories  deferred income taxes  and goodwill  we must make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding future events and circumstances that could effect the value of those assets  such as future economic conditions that will affect our ability to collect our accounts receivable or sell our inventories in fut ure periods 
those judgments  estimates and assumptions are based on current information available to us at the time they are made 
many of those events and circumstances  however  are outside of our control and if changes in those circumstances or unanticipated events occur thereafter  gaap may require us to adjust our earlier estimates that are affected by those changes 
any downward adjustments are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets involved 
it is our practice in certain cases to establish reserves or allowances to record any downward adjustments or write downs in the carrying value of assets such as these 
examples include reserves or allowances established for uncollectible accounts receivable sometimes referred to as bad debt reserves and reserves for slow moving inventory 
write downs are charged against these reserves or allowances and those reserves are replenished following such write downs  or increased to take account of changed conditions or events  by charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those reserves or allowances are replenished or increased 
with respect to other assets  such as goodwill  we write down their carrying value directly in the event of an impa irment as a charge to income 
as a result  our judgments  estimates and assumptions about future events can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record these assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
the decisions of when adjustments or write downs of this nature should be made also require subjective judgments involving an assessment or prediction abut the effects and duration of events or changes in circumstances 
for example  it is not easy to predict whether events  such as occurred on september  or increases in interest rates or economic slowdowns  will have short or longer term consequences for a particular business and it is not uncommon for it to take some time  after the occurrence of an event or the onset of changes in economic circumstances  for the full effects of such events or changes to be recognized 
under gaap  most businesses also must make estimates or judgments regarding the periods during which  and also regarding the amounts at which  sales are recorded 
those estimates and judgments will depend on such factors as the circumstances under which customers may be entitled to return the products or reject or adjust the payment for the services provided to them 
additionally  in the case of a company that grants its customers contractual rights to return products sold to them  gaap generally will require that the company establish a reserve or allowance for product returns by means of a reduction in the amount at which its sales are recorded  based primarily on the nature  extensiveness and duration of those rights and its historical product return experience 
in making our estimates and assumptions we follow gaap and accounting practices applicable to our business that we believe will enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the fair value of those assets and establish adequate reserves or allowances 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations that are discussed below 
revenue recognition policies 
grading and authentication services 
our grading customers generally prepay our grading and authentication fees when they submit their collectible coins and trading cards to us for grading and authentication 
we record those prepayments as deferred revenue 
upon grading of the collectible and its shipment back to the customer  we record the revenue from the grading and authentication services rendered and deduct this amount from deferred revenue 
for certain dealers to whom we extend open account privileges  we record revenue at the time of shipment 
auction sales of collectibles 
at our auctions we sell collectibles that we own and collectibles that are consigned to us by dealers and collectors 
in the case of auction sales of the collectibles that we own  we record revenues at the successful bidder amount  or hammer  as revenues from merchandise sold and a buyer s fee charged to the winning bidder as commissions earned 
we also record the cost of the merchandise sold as cost of revenues 
in the case of consigned collectibles  we record  as commissions earned  the amounts of a buyer s fee charged to the winning bidder and a seller s fee that is charged to the consignor 
depending upon the type of co llectibles auction  the buyer s fee ranges from to and the seller s or consignor s fee ranges from to 
on some large or important consignments  we may negotiate a reduced consignor commission or even pay a fee to the consignor 
in each case  we record our auction sales revenues at the time the collectible that has been sold at auction is either shipped or delivered in person to the successful bidder 
shipment or delivery generally takes place after payment is received from the successful bidder  which can be as long as days after completion of the auction 
as a result  revenues from sales made at auctions conducted in the second half of a fiscal quarter usually will not be recorded until the subsequent quarter 
however  for certain repeat bidders we ship or deliver in person the collectibles at the close of an auction and allow them to pay up to days following the auction 
those sales are also recorded at the time of delivery or shipment 
we also offer extended payment t erms to certain collectors or dealers 
return rights 
we sometimes provide our customers with limited rights to return items sold 
we establish an allowance for estimated returns  which reduces the amounts of our reported revenues  based on historical returns experience 
accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of business  we extend payment terms to larger  more creditworthy collectibles dealers 
we regularly review their accounts and estimate the amount of and establish an allowance for uncollectible amounts in each reporting period 
the amount of that allowance is based on several factors  including the age of unpaid amounts  a review of significant past due accounts  and economic conditions that may affect the ability of dealers to keep their accounts current 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are reviewed each period and  based on that review  are revised to reflect changed circumstances or conditions and those changes are recorded in the period they become known 
for example  if the financial condition of certain dealers or economic conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting the ability of those dealers to make payments on their accounts  increases in the allowance may be required 
since the allowance is created by recording a charge against income that is reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will cause a decline in our operating results in the period when the increase is recorded 
inventory valuation reserve 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and are reduced by an inventory valuation allowance to provide for declines in the value of our inventory  which consists of collectible coins  sportscards and other collectibles 
the amount of the allowance is determined on the basis of historical experience  estimates concerning future economic conditions and estimates of future sales 
if there is an economic downturn or a decline in sales  causing inventories of some collectibles to accumulate  it may become necessary to increase the allowance 
increases in this allowance will cause a decline in operating results as s uch increases are effectuated by charges against income 
additionally  due to the relative uniqueness of some of the collectibles included in our inventory  valuation of such inventory often involves judgments that are more subjective than is the case with raw materials and other items maintained by most other types of businesses 
as a result  there may be some instances when we are not able to identify a decline in the value of some collectibles until they are sold 
long lived assets and goodwill 
long lived assets such as property and equipment  and goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
prior to fiscal  estimated undiscounted future cash flows were used to determine if an asset was impaired and  if such a determination was made  the carrying value of the asset would be reduced to fair value 
any resulting impairment was recorded as a charge against income in the period in which the impairment was recorded 
however  under a new standard established by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  that became applicable in fiscal  we are required to make goodwill impairment determinations on the basis of the fair values of the assets of our reporting units  as defined in sfas no 
 rather than on the basis of undiscounted cash flows 
sfas no 
required us to perform a transitional goodwill impairment test as of the beginning of fiscal  the year of adoption of that new standard 
accordingly  we conducted that test at a reporting unit level and compared each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
we first determined that collectors universe s reporting units were sub units of its reportable segments 
we then measured the value for each reporting unit on the basis of a weighted combination of valuation approaches  including discounted cash flows and multiples of sales and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
on the basis of that valuation  we concluded that a substantial portion of our goodwill was impaired  and we recorded a non cash after tax charge of  or per share  as a cumulative effect of an accounting change  in the first quarter of fiscal  that ended on september  we conducted an additional impairment test  in accordance with sfas at june  and concluded that all of our remaining goodwill was impaired and  as a result  we recorded an additional non cash impairment charge of  in the quarter ended june   in that case as an operating expense rather than as a transitional charge for an accounting change 
see results of operations goodwill impairment below 
grading warranty costs 
we offer a warranty covering the coins and sportscards we authenticate and grade 
under the warranty  if any coin or sportscard originally graded by us  which is later submitted to us for re grading in the same tamper resistant holder in which it was placed at the time we last graded it  receives a lower grade upon that resubmittal  we will offer either to purchase the coin or sportscard or pay the difference in value of the item at its original grade as compared with its lower grade 
similarly  any coin or sportscard originally graded by us  which subsequently is determined to be not authentic  obligates us to purchase the coin or sportscard 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs based on historical trends and related experience 
to date our reserves have proved to be adequate 
however  if warranty claims were to exceed those reserves  we would incur additional charges that would adversely affect our operating results 
to date our reserves have proved to be adequate 
overview our business 
collectors universe provides grading and authentication services for sportscards  rare coins  vintage stamps and authentication services for autographs and sports memorabilia 
we also sell rare coins and rare currencies  sportscards  sports and entertainment memorabilia and other collectibles through auctions and direct sales channels 
most of our collectibles auctions are conducted utilizing a multi venue format that may include in person  internet  mail in  and telephone bidding options 
this multi venue format allows bidders to enter auction bids at any time and from any place in the manner that is most convenient for them 
we also sell rare coins  sportscards  spo rts memorabilia and autographs through shows  catalogs  internet and direct sales 
factors that can affect our revenues and cash flows 
our auctions are held periodically throughout the fiscal year 
the number  scheduling  and size of the auctions we conduct vary from quarter to quarter  depending largely on the volume  value and timing of the collectibles consignments that we receive for our auctions 
for this reason  our auction revenue can vary  sometimes significantly  from quarter to quarter 
additionally  under our revenue recognition policies  we do not recognize auction revenues until the items sold at an auction are either shipped based on agreement with the customer or delivered in person to the winning bidders 
since those items generally are not shipped to the winning bidders until payment is received from them  which can take up to days after completion of an auction  revenue generated from auctions conducted near the end of a fiscal period often cannot be reported until the succeeding fiscal period  which contributes to the period to period variability in our auction revenues 
these circumstances also make it difficult to forecast  on a quarterly basis  revenue that will be attributable to our auction business 
our cash flow is also affected by the number and timing of the auctions we conduct 
generally  we pay consignors of collectibles to our auctions the cash price at which their collectibles were sold  less the seller s commissions earned by us  approximately days after completion of the auction 
however  many of the payments for those collectibles from the winning bidders are not received until days after an auction is completed 
as a result  we experience significant cash outflows within the first days  and cash inflows beginning days  following completion of a large auction 
therefore  the amount of cash that we have at the end of any fiscal period can vary widely  depending on the number and timing of the auctions conducted during that fiscal period 
factors affecting our gross profit margins 
the gross margin on sales of consigned collectibles is significantly higher than the gross margin on sales of owned collectibles because we realize commissions on sales of consigned collectibles without having to incur any significant associated costs 
by contrast  upon the sale of owned collectibles  we record the costs of acquiring those collectibles  which are usually a significant percentage of the selling price 
as a result  the sale of owned collectibles reduces our overall auction margins to a level that is significantly below that realized for authentication and grading services 
additionally  to a lesser extent  the gross profit mar gins on grading submissions can be affected by the mix of submissions between vintage or classic coins and sportscards  on the one hand  and modern coins and sportscards  on the other hand 
generally  our prices for grading services vary depending on the turn around time requested by submitting dealers and collectors  who are willing to pay more for faster turn around of the coins and sportscards they submit for grading 
as a general rule  dealers and collectors request faster turn around for vintage or classic coins and sportscards than they do for modern submissions 
consequently  our gross margin depends  not only upon the mix of grading revenues and auction revenues  but also upon the mix of consigned and owned collectibles sold at our auctions and the mix of vintage and modern collectibles submitted for grading and authentication 
impact of economic conditions on financial performance 
we generate substantially all of our revenues from the collectibles market segment  which primarily relies on discretionary consumer spending 
as a result  our revenues sometimes decline and our operating result can be adversely affected by recessionary economic conditions  which often result in a decline in sales of collectibles which  in turn  can lead to a decline in grading submissions and a reduction in the auction sales 
on the other hand  conditions such as these  as well as declines or volatility in the stock market  often lead investors to increase their purchases of precious metals  which also lead to increased purchas es of collectible coins and in submissions of such collectibles for grading 
we believe that these market factors contributed to the increase in our revenues in fiscal by contrast  we believe that the advent of the recession in fiscal and its continuation into fiscal contributed to the decline in our revenues in those years

net revenues 
net revenues include fees generated from the grading and authentication of sportscards  coins  autographs and stamps  the sales prices of owned collectibles sold in our auctions and directly to collectors  commissions earned on sales of consigned collectibles at our auctions  and revenue from the publication of collectibles magazines 
net revenues are determined net of discounts and allowances  product returns  and commissions paid to consignors on sales of their collectibles 
net revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in the prior year 
collectible sales revenue increased to  in fiscal from  in the prior fiscal year  while grading and authentication revenues increased by to  in the current fiscal year from  in fiscal collectible sales revenue represented and of total revenues  while grading and authentication revenues represented and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
we believe that this increase was fueled  at least in part  by an increase in purchases of precious metals and collectibles by investors in response to continued uncertainties and volatility in the securities markets and an increase in consumer confidence  particularly i n the first half of fiscal the increase in grading and authentication revenues in fiscal occurred primarily as a result of increases in coin and sportscard grading submissions of and  respectively 
however  the increase in sportscard submissions was offset somewhat by a decline in the average price for sportscard grading  that was primarily attributable to an increase in bulk grading submissions by sportscard manufacturers of newly manufactured sportscards and a reduction in the number of vintage sportscard submissions  which tend to use a higher priced grading service rate because of the value of the sportscards 
in fiscal  net revenues decreased to  from  in fiscal collectible sales revenues decreased to  in fiscal from  in the prior fiscal year  while grading and authentication revenues declined by to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal collectible sales revenue represented and of total revenues  while grading and authentication revenue represented and of total revenues  for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in grading and authentication revenues in fiscal occurred primarily because of a decrease in sportscard submissions 
on the other hand  coin grading submissions increased in fiscal fr om fiscal however  that increase in coin grading submissions only partially offset the decline in revenues from sportscard grading submissions because the average price for coin grading declined from the prior year 
the reduction in sportscard submissions in fiscal was caused by several factors  including i reduced submissions by sportscard manufacturers for bulk grading  and ii a reduction in resale prices of modern sportscards  which reduced the economic incentive to have these cards graded and sold 
in addition  sportscard grading revenue was negatively impacted by a decline in vintage sportscard submissions  which tend to use a higher priced grading service rate because of the value of these sportscards 
the decline in the average price for coin grading in fiscal was primarily due to a higher proportion of modern coin submittals versus vintage submittals 
grading fees for modern coins are generally lower than grading fees for vintage coins  and this causes the average selling pric e to decline 
for fiscal  the average grading fee for coins declined approximately 
the decrease in collectibles sales revenues in fiscal was due to several diverse factors  including i a continued decline  which began in fiscal  in the demand for sportscards that we sell at auctions and in our direct sales channels  and ii a reduction in consignments by dealers and collectors to our premium bowers and merena coin auctions and to our lyn knight currency auctions which we believe was primarily due to concerns about the prices that could be realized for their coins and currency due to the economic recession 
gross profit 
gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of revenues from net revenues 
cost of revenues consist primarily of labor to grade and authenticate coins and sportscards  production costs  printing  credit cards fees  warranty expense and the cost of owned collectibles sold in our auctions 
gross profit margin is gross profit stated as a percent of net revenues 
our gross margin gross profits as a percentage of revenues declined to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
the decline was due primarily to i a decision  in the second half of the year to liquidate older inventories of collectibles at bargain sales prices  ii an increase in gold bullion sales  which were made as an accommodation to collectibles sales customers at prices close to our cost of those sales  and iii charges to cost of sales  increasing our inventory reserves for those items in inventory with carrying cost in excess of current market value 
the gross profit for grading and authentication in fiscal did not change from the prior fiscal year 
our gross profit margin declined to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
that decline was due primarily to i the decline in net sales which affected gross profit margins because a significant portion of our costs of sales are fixed and  therefore  cannot be reduced directly in proportion to decreases in our revenues  and ii lower gross profit margins on grading activities because we received a higher proportion of modern sportscards for grading 
as previously discussed  collectors and dealers submitting modern sportscards generally elect lower cost grading services than with respect to vintage sportscards 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses primarily include wages and payroll related expenses  advertising and promotional expenses  facility and security expenses  outside service charges  travel related expenses and other general administrative expenses 
as a percentage of revenues sg a expense decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal that improvement was due primarily to reductions in overhead personnel and related expenses which  however  were substantially offset by the costs of relocating our bowers and merena division from new hampshire to louisiana 
in fiscal year  general and administrative expen ses also included a  charge for services rendered in by deloitte touche in assisting us to secure  in state enterprise zone tax credits 
in fiscal  overall sg a expense increased to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
that increase was due primarily to i costs of implementing the company s new enterprise computer management system  including integration of that system with the company s existing grading software  and ii costs associated with changes in management and severance costs resulting from staff reductions that occurred in fiscal as a percentage of total net revenue  sg a expenses increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal  primarily because revenues decreased  while sg a was increasing 
amortization of goodwill 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective as of july  in accordance with sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill recorded in past business combinations effective as of july  as a result  there is no charg e for goodwill amortization expense contained in our statement of operations for the fiscal year ended june   whereas our statements of operations for fiscal and do contain charges for goodwill amortization expense 
for fiscal years prior to  amortization of goodwill consists of goodwill charges relating to our acquisitions of businesses and amortization charges for non competition agreements that we obtained from the sellers in those acquisitions 
we amortized goodwill over periods of to years and non competition agreements over the respective terms of those agreements  which range from to years 
amortization expense for fiscal was goodwill impairment 
effective as of the july   which was the beginning of fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
 which requires us as well as other companies to assess goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment 
sfas no 
requires that a determination be made of the fair value of the recorded goodwill of a company s assets  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in a business combination  and that a goodwill impairment charge be recorded if the carrying amount of the goodwill is found to exceed the fair value of the recorded goodwill on the books of the company 
in accordance with sfas  we condu cted a goodwill impairment test at june  and concluded that all of our remaining goodwill was impaired 
as a result  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of  as an operating expense 
that charge is in addition to a previously reported non cash goodwill impairment charge taken in the first quarter of fiscal  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
see results of operations cumulative effect of change in accounting principle below 
at june   we determined that the goodwill associated with professional stamp experts pse was partially impaired 
this impairment resulted from a reduction in the projected revenues of pse over the next several years 
accordingly  we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of  in fiscal to reduce the carrying value of the pse goodwill to during fiscal  we determined that the goodwill associated with our acquisition of internet universe  llc  which conducted our internet operations  had become impaired 
this determination resulted primarily from a change in our projected revenue for internet advertising on our website www 
collectors 
com  due to industry wide reductions in the viability of banner advertising and the rates that could be charged for this type of internet advertising 
accordingly  we incurred a charge of  in fiscal to reduce the carrying value of the internet universe  llc goodwill to zero 
interest income 
interest income is generated on cash balances that we invest primarily in a highly liquid money market account  short term bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper instruments 
interest income was  in fiscal  compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to reductions in market rates of interest earned on cash balances during as compared to the decrease in interest income in fiscal  from fiscal  was the result of a reduction in average invested cash balances 
income taxes 
a tax benefit of  was recorded for fiscal year  reflecting the loss incurred for the year and the recognition of state tax credits related to california enterprise zone credits 
a tax benefit of  was recorded for fiscal year  reflecting the loss incurred for the year 
for fiscal  the provision for income taxes was  despite a loss from operations before income taxes 
this provision for income taxes resulted from the non deductibility  for income tax purposes  of certain goodwill amortization expenses and other permanent tax differences 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
required us to perform a transitional goodwill impairment test as of the beginning of fiscal  the year of adoption of that new standard 
accordingly  we conducted that test at a reporting unit level and compared each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
we first determined that our reporting units were sub units of its reportable segments 
we then measured the value for each reporting unit on the basis of a weighted combination of valuation approaches  including discounted cash flows and multiples of sales and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
on the basis of that valuation  we concluded that a substantial portion our goodwill was impaired  and we recorded a non cash after tax charge of  or per share  as a cumulative effect of an accounting change  in the first quarter of fiscal  that ended on september  this charge  along with the goodwill impairment charge taken as an operating expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal  increased our net loss for fiscal and reduced our stockholders equity at june   but did not affect our tangible net worth and is not expected to adversely affect our business operations or cash flows 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included later in this report 
quarterly results of operations and seasonality the following table presents unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the eight quarters beginning september  and ending on june  the information has been derived from our unaudited quarterly financial statements  which have been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k

because of the variability of the timing  the size and collectible content of our auctions is an inherent feature of our business  we expect that our cash and cash equivalent balances  and outstanding consignor payables  will be subject to significant fluctuations in subsequent reporting periods

we anticipate that  during fiscal  we will be making capital expenditures of less than  however  our capital requirements during the next months could change as a result of any of a number of factors  including the level of sales that we are able to generate during fiscal  which will depend both on the size of and the value of the collectibles we are able to sell at our auctions  and on grading submission rates and our growth rates 
in addition  as part of our business strategy  we will continue to seek out opportunities to expand our business  both through internal growth and by acquisition  which could require significant cash expenditures 
depending upon these and other factors  we may require additional financing in the future through equity or debt offerings  which may or may not be available or may be dilutive to our shareholders 
our ability to obtain additional ca pital will depend upon our operating results  financial condition  future business prospects and conditions then prevailing in the relevant capital markets

these funds are primarily invested in a highly liquid money market fund  and interest earned is re invested in the same fund 
the company is exposed to the risk of declining short term interest rates  but we do not consider this risk to be material 
we have no activities that would expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risks or commodity price risks
