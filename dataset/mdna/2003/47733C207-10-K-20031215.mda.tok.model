results of operations 
sales increased to  during fiscal as compared to fiscal when sales were  sales for fiscal were  the twenty seven percent increase in sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the contribution of greenwood products  inc  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of jewett cameron lumber company 
fiscal was the first full fiscal year that greenwood product  inc operated as a subsidiary of jewett cameron lumber company  whereas in fiscal it only operated for six months 
jewett cameron seed company  a wholly owned subsidiary of the registrant also contributed with an increase in sales of  or during fiscal as compared to fiscal the company continues to experience a decrease in sales in the area of lumber and building materials which management believes is due to recessionary conditions in the economy causing customers to scale back their purchases of these discretionary items 
the loss of revenue from these products has been offset by the sales increases in other areas  however  management believes that once consumer confidence strengthens  lumber and building material sales will again trend upward 
the company has also introduced new products for retailers  which  in the past  concentrated on more expensive items 
these new products  which are described earlier in this document  are less costly and consequently  overall sales by the company to these retailers are on the rise

management attributes the lower percentage during fiscal and fiscal to efficiencies introduced into jewett cameron seed company and the additions to operations of greenwood products 
an increase in wages and employee benefits of  attributable primarily to staff associated with greenwood products  inc  was also a significant factor in the increase in operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses began to decrease during the second half of fiscal the primary reason for the decrease was a restructuring of the activities of greenwood products during the first and second quarters of fiscal this restructuring included reductions in salaries resulting from the elimination of some clerical positions and wage cuts resulting from the sales decreases 
as a result of these actions  wages and employee benefits decreased from the third quarter of fiscal level of  to  for the third quarter of fiscal office expenses also decreased by  during the third quarter of fiscal as compared to the third quarter of fiscal resulting from the company s efforts to reduce expenses 
interest expense increased from  reported in fiscal to  in fiscal the primary reason for the increase in interest expense was the higher level of borrowing resulting from the increased level of inventory required to support the elevated sales level of fiscal the increase in operating expenses coupled with the higher level of interest expense resulted in net income for the company to decrease during fiscal as compared to the two prior fiscal years

therefore  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents as well as interest paid on debt 
the company has lines of credit and other debt whose interest rates are based on various published prime rates that may fluctuate over time based on economic changes in the environment 
the company is subject to interest rate risk and could be subject to increased interest payments if market interest rates fluctuate 
the company does not expect any change in the interest rates to have a material adverse effect on the company s results from operations 
foreign currency risk the company operates primarily in the united states  however  some business is transacted with canadian firms 
the company s business and financial condition is  therefore  sensitive to currency exchange rates or any other restrictions imposed on its currency
