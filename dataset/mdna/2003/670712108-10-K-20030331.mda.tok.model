acquisitions and investments nyfix transaction services in december  we acquired an inactive broker dealer for  an d filed a membership application with the nasd to operate as a broker deale r through the wholly owned subsidiary  which we renamed nyfix transactio n services

nyfix millennium provides an efficien t way for major financial institutions and traders to obtain the best matc h available for their transactions in the listed equities marketplace 
in september  nyfix millennium was formed as a limited liabilit y company  by us and seven international investment banks and brokerage firms consisting of deutsche bank  abn amro securities formerly ing barings  lehma n brothers  morgan stanley dean witter equity investments ltd  alliance capita l management formerly sanford c 
bernstein co  societe generale investmen t corporation formerly sg cowen and ubs warburg the initial partners 
eac h of the initial partners invested million in nyfix millennium in exchang e for  units of nyfix millennium  collectively owning a membershi p interest in nyfix millennium 
we invested million and owned the remainin g 
in addition  we purchased an option to buy  from the initial partners  a n additional membership interest in nyfix millennium the option  for whic h we paid each of the initial partners  shares of our common stock 
th e option allowed us to increase our membership interest in nyfix millennium up t o of the total membership interest through the exchange of one share of ou r common stock for each unit of nyfix millennium purchased  subject to certai n adjustments 
in march  nyfix millennium added four more partners  consisting o f bank of america  wachovia securities formerly first union securities an d labmorgan corporation formerly jp morgan co 
and chase h q the ne w partners 
pursuant to the terms of the nyfix millennium operating agreement each new partner invested million in nyfix millennium in exchange fo r  units of nyfix millennium 
we maintained our membership interest i n nyfix millennium in exchange for reducing certain of our rights to share i n future dividend distributions of nyfix millennium 
we issued  shares o f our common stock to each new partner in return for the same option noted above with labmorgan corporation as the successor to two partners receiving  shares 
at december   our investment in nyfix millennium of million consisted of million of our shares of common stock  shares in of our common stock at per share and  shares i n march and april of our common stock at per share and our capita l cash contribution of million 
we funded certain operating costs and capita l expenditures on behalf of nyfix millennium 
such advances of million wer e reflected as due from unconsolidated affiliates on our consolidated balanc e sheet at december  in addition  we loaned to nyfix millennium a n aggregate of million  plus accrued interest  of which million wa s loaned in the million loaned in  plus accrued interest  i s reflected in notes receivable from unconsolidated affiliates on ou r consolidated balance sheet at december  nyfix  inc 
on january   we notified the initial partners and new partner s that we would exercise our option  effective february  in exchange fo r the increased membership interest in nyfix millennium  we paid the initia l partners and new partners an aggregate of  shares of our common stoc k with a fair value of million  with each initial partner receiving  shares of common stock and each new partner receiving  shares of commo n stock 
as a result  we increased our ownership of nyfix millennium to 
th e results of operations of nyfix millennium have been included in our consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition date 
all advance s and loans  including accrued interest  have been eliminated in consolidatio n commencing on february  the excess of the purchase price over the fai r value of the net assets acquired was million and has been recorded a s goodwill 
some of our key considerations for the acquisition of nyfix millenniu m included nyfix millennium s growth in revenue  the attractiveness of th e synergies we anticipated with our recently acquired nyfix transaction service s broker dealer  and our ability to exercise significant control over nyfi x millennium s operations 
pursuant to our nyfix millennium operating agreement  as amended  th e first million in nyfix millennium operating losses since inception wa s allocated to the initial partners and new partners  which equaled the extent o f their capital contribution to nyfix millennium 
the minority interest in nyfi x millennium disclosed in our accompanying consolidated statement of operation s for the year ended december  reflects the allocation of nyfix millenniu m losses to the initial partners and new partners post acquisition to the exten t of their capital contribution  thereby reducing their minority interest to zero in addition  we recognized nyfix millennium operating losses of million fo r the year ended december   which were million greater than ou r capital contribution of million 
while we expect nyfix millennium to b e profitable in the future  there can be no assurances of such profitability 
as a result  we have not allocated to the initial partners and new partners their pr o rata share of nyfix millennium losses in excess of our capital contribution aggregating million  at december   since we cannot assur e recoverability of the asset that such an allocation would create 
at such tim e when nyfix millennium achieves profitability  of its profits  net of u s recovering our over allocated losses  will be allocated to the initial partner s and new partners 
javelin on march   we acquired of the outstanding capital stock o f javelin 
we financed the transaction with a combination of i million i n net cash  ii  shares of our common stock having a fair value of million  and iii  shares of our common stock having a fair value o f million reserved for issuance upon exercise of javelin stock option s assumed by us

application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result s of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have bee n prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in th e united states of america 
these principles require us to make estimates an d assumptions which could materially affect the reported amounts of assets an d liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dat e of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expens e during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates an d assumptions  including those related to accounts receivable reserves investments  goodwill  long lived assets  revenue recognition  produc t enhancement costs  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates an d assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that ar e believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form th e basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilitie s that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ fro m these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies  among others  are critica l to the understanding of our results of operations due to the assumptions we mus t make in their application 
senior management has discussed the development an d selection of these accounting policies  and estimates  and the relate d disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors audi t committee 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements i n item of this annual report on form k for our significant accountin g policies 
revenue recognition our revenue is comprised of subscription  sale  service contract an d transaction components 
subscription revenue contracts are generally for leasing of ou r equipment and use of our nyfix network  with an initial term of one to thre e years with automatic renewal periods unless we receive prior notice o f nyfix  inc 
cancellation 
under the terms of the subscription contracts  customers ar e typically invoiced a flat periodic charge after initial installation an d acceptance 
revenue related to these contracts is recognized over the initia l term of the contract on a straight line basis 
we also include within ou r subscription revenue  telecommunication and other charges  which we provide t o the customer at cost plus a normal profit 
such revenue is recognized as th e services are provided 
as we have no history of significant cancellations  we d o not record a reserve for cancellations 
sale revenue  which is comprised of software and capital equipmen t sales  is recognized when the software and equipment have been shipped an d accepted by the customer and when other contractual obligations  includin g installation if applicable  have been satisfied and collection of the resultin g receivable is reasonably assured 
as we have no history of significant sale s returns  we do not record a reserve for sales returns and allowances 
service contract revenue  which is comprised of maintenance contract s for subscription equipment and software and capital equipment  is recognize d over the contract period on a straight line basis 
service contracts fo r subscription equipment are generally co terminus with the subscription contract service contracts for software and capital equipment are generally for a n initial term of one to three years with automatic renewal periods unless w e receive prior notice of cancellation 
transaction revenue contracts provide for transaction or executio n services  which are comprised of a usage or transaction based fee for trade s executed through our broker dealer operations 
revenue on these contracts i s generally invoiced in arrears and recognized in the period in which it i s earned 
we periodically enter into contracts  which include subscriptio n equipment and telecommunication charges to be invoiced at a minimu m transaction based fee 
we account for these contracts as both subscriptio n revenue  for its minimal fee  and transaction revenue  for the amount earned i n excess of its minimal fee 
we value the minimal fee as the fair value of simila r subscription equipment leased and telecommunication charges provided to simila r customers 
certain subscription and service contract agreements provide fo r invoicing in advance of the service being performed  generally quarterly revenue on contracts invoiced in advance is deferred and recognized as revenu e over the period earned and is included in deferred revenue in our accompanyin g consolidated balance sheets 
shipping  handling and installation charges  i f any  are generally invoiced to a customer and are included in revenue upo n completion of the installation 
we periodically enter into arrangements that include multipl e deliverables  which typically consist of the sale of software and capita l equipment with additional services  such as installation  training and servic e among others 
services provided subsequent to initial delivery and installation s are typically invoiced separately 
we account for each element of an arrangemen t with multiple deliverables separately 
the arrangement consideration i s allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of each element vendor specific objective evidence for fair value of services is primaril y determined by reference to renewal pricing 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value by recordin g allowances for those accounts receivable amounts that we believe to b e uncollectible 
the estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts is based o n collection experience  which includes analyzing prior accounts receivabl e written off and reviewing the aging of the accounts receivable 
our allowanc e for doubtful accounts includes amounts for specific accounts that are believe d to be uncollectible  as well as amounts that have been computed by applyin g certain percentages based on historical loss trends  to certain account s receivable aging categories  net of accounts receivable for which revenu e recognition has been deferred 
nyfix  inc 
property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation included in equipment are certain costs related to the development of our nyfi x network to support our subscription and service based businesses 
business combinations and goodwill business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method o f accounting and include the results of operations of the acquired businesses fro m the dates of their respective acquisition 
net assets of acquired companies ar e recorded at their fair value to us at the date of acquisition 
goodwil l represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective january   which require s that goodwill and certain other intangible assets having indefinite lives n o longer be amortized to income  but instead be tested for impairment annually a s well as on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances indicate tha t goodwill might be impaired 
effective october   we performed the annua l test for impairment using the discounted cash flow valuation method 
there wa s no impairment to the value of our recorded goodwill 
capitalized product enhancement costs we capitalize certain costs of internally developed software as produc t enhancement costs 
internally capitalized costs consist of payroll and payrol l related costs  purchased materials and services and software to be used withi n our products 
we defer those costs that significantly enhance the marketabilit y or significantly extend the life of our products 
we are required to us e professional judgment in determining whether product enhancement costs meet th e criteria for immediate expense or capitalization  in accordance with sfas no  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  o r otherwise marketed 
product enhancement costs are amortized using th e straight line method over three years 
long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets  including propert y and equipment  intangible assets  investments and other long term amounts du e from unconsolidated affiliates  and capitalized product enhancement costs fo r impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amoun t may not be fully recoverable 
if such an event or circumstances occurs  th e related estimated fair value of the assets would be compared to the carryin g amount  and if needed  we would record an impairment to the extent by which th e carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
there was no impairment o f long lived assets recorded for the years ended december   and income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based o n the estimated future tax consequences of differences between the financia l statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective ta x bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using presently enacte d tax rates in effect for the periods the temporary differences are expected to b e settled 
a valuation allowance is established  as needed  to reduce net deferre d nyfix  inc 
tax assets to realizable value 
a valuation allowance has not been establishe d for our deferred tax assets  as we believe it is more likely than not that the y will be realized 
contingencies contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimat e loss will exceed the recorded provision 
we use outside counsel to assist us i n various matters including securities and sec regulations  acquisitions trademark  patent and personnel matters 
we rely on the professional judgment o f outside counsel as well as our own assessment in determining whethe r contingencies should be recorded

the effective income tax provision rate of fo r was lower than the federal statutory tax rate as a result of the reversa l of valuation allowances as we believed that we would realize the benefit o f prior income tax net operating losses and other temporary differences  whic h resulted in the previously established valuation allowance 
events of september th the events of september   did not have a material effect on ou r financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
we believe that thes e events did not affect our overall growth outlook 
we credited the ongoin g investment in state of the art redundant data centers and our nyfix networ k infrastructure for our ability to maintain effective operations across al l products and services throughout the month of september while ou r employees worked around the clock to assist many clients in recovery testing and in some cases establishing temporary emergency operations  we opted not t o charge any customers one time fees in connection with these efforts 
we also di d not incur any significant incremental expense in connection with the events o f september  although the events of september  did not have a significan t effect on our results of operations  they did have an effect on nyfi x millennium  which we had a ownership interest in  at that time 
afte r roll out efforts were temporarily stalled by the tragic events of septembe r th  nyfix millennium usage increased later in the fourth quarter of bringing the system back to initial execution levels 
liquidity and capital resources in june  we raised million  net of expenses  from a follow o n public offering of million shares of our common stock 
we used a portion o f the net proceeds for working capital requirements  to re purchase millio n shares of our common stock  to continue to invest in our infrastructure an d products and  subsequently  to acquire javelin in march of and invest i n eurolink and renaissance 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents an d short term investments totaled million as compared to million a t december  we had investments of million in current marketabl e security instruments  having interest rates ranging from to  million in a tax free money fund with an average day yield of and million in money market funds with an average day yield of  at decembe r at december   we had total debt of million  whic h represented current and long term amounts outstanding under capital leas e obligations 
at december   we had no material commitments for capita l expenditures or inventory purchases 
our long term capital needs depend o n numerous factors  including the rate we obtain new clients and expand our staf f and infrastructure  as needed  to accommodate such growth  as well as the rat e at which we choose to invest in new technologies to modify our nyfix network an d infrastructure 
we have ongoing needs for capital  including working capital fo r operations and capital expenditures to maintain and expand our operations 
we believe that we can achieve synergies from our recently acquire d nyfix millennium and javelin businesses 
although our nyfix millennium busines s has incurred losses through its development and start up stages  we believe tha t revenue will continue to increase as we gain greater acceptance of our produc t offerings 
however  we expect nyfix millennium to possibly need additiona l working capital during the first six to nine months of  until it achieve s positive cash flow from operations 
our strategy is to migrate javelin to mor e of a subscription based revenue model  similar to our core nyfix usa business this may cause javelin capital sale revenue to be unpredictable an d inconsistent 
as such  this too  may unfavorably impact our working capital 
i n addition  our unconsolidated affiliates  renaissance and eurolink  have require d nyfix  inc 
million in funding from us in the past 
we may be required to provid e additional funding to them  until they generate positive cash flow or obtai n other sources of capital 
such additional funding  if required  may unfavorabl y impact our working capital 
we believe that our cash and investments of million  together wit h anticipated cash to be generated from operations will be sufficient to suppor t our capital and operating needs  including the operating needs of nyfi x millennium and javelin for at least the next twelve months

factors affecting operating results some of our recently acquired subsidiaries have not been profitable an d therefore we may not be profitable in the future 
in december  we acquired an inactive broker dealer and renamed i t nyfix transaction services  inc in may  the nasd approved nyfi x transaction services membership application and it first started generatin g revenues as of july  through its first year of operations  nyfi x transaction services had incurred a net loss of million 
although we expec t nyfix transaction services to start to generate positive cash flows during we can provide no assurances of our success in doing such 
accordingly  nyfi x transaction services may need us to provide the necessary capital to maintai n their minimum capital requirements  thus impacting our working capital 
nyfix  inc 
effective as of february   we increased our ownership interest i n nyfix millennium from to 
nyfix millennium was formed in september and since that time has been in the development and start up stages and ha s incurred aggregate net losses of million through december  although we expect nyfix millennium to start to generate positive cash flow s towards the latter half of  we can provide no assurances of our success i n doing such 
accordingly  nyfix millennium may need us to provide the necessar y capital to maintain their minimum capital requirements  thus impacting ou r working capital 
effective as of march   we acquired javelin 
javelin incurre d net losses of million  million and million for the years an d and the three months ended march   respectively 
although javeli n results are not reported separately  javelin continued to incur operating losse s until the fourth quarter of we believe that our synergies with javeli n will enhance our overall operating results 
however  our strategy to apply ou r subscription based model to javelin s products  where feasible  may not b e successful 
javelin s business is heavily concentrated towards capital sales which are very unpredictable and inconsistent 
transitioning javelin to more o f a subscription based model could have an adverse impact on our working capital 
a number of our subsidiaries have a limited operating history  which makes i t difficult to evaluate their prospects  so their future financial performance ma y disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stoc k price 
nyfix millennium and javelin were formed in september and novembe r  respectively 
also  we purchased nyfix transaction services in decembe r because of their limited operating history  these entities have limite d financial data  which can be used to evaluate their businesses 
consideratio n must be given to their prospects in light of the risks  expenses  delays problems and difficulties frequently encountered in the establishment of a ne w business in an emerging and rapidly evolving industry 
nyfix millennium  javeli n and nyfix transaction services may not be successful in their businesses  an d profitability may never be attained or sustained 
we have two unconsolidated subsidiaries  which may need additional funding fro m us  thus having an adverse impact on our liquidity 
we have provided funding to our unconsolidated affiliates  renaissanc e and eurolink  in the past 
in our balance sheet  at december   we hav e amounts due and notes receivable from unconsolidated affiliates of million we provided renaissance an additional million in the first quarter of in exchange for a secured promissory note 
renaissance may require additiona l funds from us  until they generate positive cash flow or obtain other sources o f capital 
we cannot provide assurance that additional interim funding  i f required  won t have an adverse impact on our liquidity 
a significant power and telecommunications failure could cause us to los e revenues and customers and subject us to liability for customer losses 
our services depend on our ability to store  retrieve  process an d manage significant databases and to electronically receive and process trad e orders 
our systems and data centers could fail due to power failures  caused b y a variety of factors  or outages  caused by high demand placed on the utility s infrastructure 
due to the complexity of these electrical systems  errors o r failures could occur which render an entire site to be unusable 
we constantly monitor system loads and performances and as necessar y upgrade our systems to handle estimated increases in power consumption 
however we may not be able to accurately predict future demand 
to mitigate the impac t of power failures  we maintain critical data center facilities at two separat e locations in north bergen  new jersey and carlstadt  new jersey 
although thes e data centers are serviced by the same utility  they are serviced via differen t sub stations 
in the event of a power outage at any of our data centers  w e maintain uninterruptible power supplies ups to provide limited batter y backup for critical systems 
we also maintain diesel powered generators t o backup the upss 
nyfix  inc 
in the event of loss of power or telecommunications services at eithe r of these locations  we believe there are sufficient backup facilities in plac e to give us the necessary time to access  or fail over to  our redundant dat a center 
it is possible that multiple telecommunications vendors could b e impacted so severely that the multi vendor and multi site strategy would no t insure communications services to our clients 
since it is fairly common for multiple carriers to share the sam e physical infrastructure such as central offices co s  telephone poles an d below ground conduit  instances like major cable cuts or regional natura l disasters could adversely impact our clients and us 
any infiltration of harmful viruses could cause us to lose revenues an d customers and subject us to liability for customer losses 
we utilize multiple methods to combat viruses 
the first method is t o prevent viruses from entering our nyfix network 
this is done by placing rigi d restrictions on our nyfix network called access controls lists acl 
acls ar e used where clients or vendors connect to our nyfix network 
a second method o f preventing viruses from entering our nyfix network is the use of firewalls 
a firewall typically guards an internal network against malicious access from th e outside  however  firewalls may also be configured to limit access to th e outside from internal users 
in spite of the acls and firewalls  it may still b e possible for viruses to enter our nyfix network 
if a virus is still able to penetrate our nyfix network  we utiliz e centrally managed anti virus scanning software on servers and workstations 
ou r anti virus software actively scans servers and workstations on the network 
i n spite of the active anti virus scanning  it is possible for a virus to not b e detected 
as an additional method to combat viruses  we utilize intrusio n detection software ids 
ids servers and software are located at key point s around the network and monitor systems for malicious activity 
we rely on multiple telecommunications carriers for data delivery 
an y disruptions to these services could have a material adverse effect on ou r business 
we utilize frame relay network services from five major carriers at t qwest  sprint  worldcom and verizon 
customers are given the choice of using on e or more network carriers to provide network services to their location 
a majority of nyfix clients utilize a dual carrier solution 
the utilization of five major carriers has multiple benefits o diversity of telecommunication infrastructure between the majo r carriers o a competitive environment to help insure aggressive pricing fo r network services o the ability to completely migrate circuits from one carrier to anothe r due to non competitive pricing or a carrier no longer providin g adequate services 
in the event that a major carrier was to shut down their network with n o advance warning eg worldcom  it would take at least days to replace th e circuits with another vendor 
in the event of a move from one carrier t o another  we would incur substantial expenses related to the cost of utilizin g two carriers for the same period of time 
we could also be impacted b y exclusivity agreements between carriers and connecting points on the network for example  worldcom is the sole provider of network services for nasdaq 
i n the event worldcom discontinued operations  we would incur costs transitionin g to a new nasdaq network service provider 
nyfix  inc 
the approximate time necessary for the transfer of circuits from on e carrier to the other would be four to six weeks 
during the transfer  we woul d incur overlapping circuit charges for a minimum of thirty days 
these charge s are due to a thirty day delay that begins when the original circuit i s disconnected  therefore  the minimum cost of moving business from one carrier t o another would be at least one months worth of charges from the original carrier we face substantial competition in our individual product areas from companie s that have larger and greater financial  technical and marketing capabilities which could make it more difficult to gain or maintain market share and ma y hinder our ability to compete successfully 
we operate in a highly competitive market and expect competition t o intensify in the future 
certain of our competitors  including the financia l exchanges  may have significantly greater financial  technical and marketin g resources and more extensive customer bases and extensive knowledge of th e industry 
our industry is constantly evolving through technological and regulator y change 
our competition varies widely and we encounter different categories o f competitors for each of our product and service offerings 
we also fac e competition from customers who choose to maintain their own infrastructure an d develop their own in house proprietary order management software systems 
our ability to sell our products and services and grow our business could b e significantly impaired if we lose the services of key personnel 
our business is highly dependent on a number of key executive officers including peter k 
hansen  our founder  chief executive officer and president and lars kragh  our chief information officer  who have been with us since ou r inception in the loss of the services of any of our key personnel coul d have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we rely  in part  on others to supply the materials and supplies  underlyin g software and systems we use to provide our services 
if we are unable to obtai n third party support and delivery on a timely and reliable basis  our ability t o perform services could be hindered and the relationships we have with ou r customers could be harmed 
our manufactured products are based on standard pc components readil y available in the consumer market place 
all electronic  computer related components utilized within our products are not manufacturer or supplie r specific 
we can substitute components from a diverse group of manufacturer s with no assembly or delivery delays to our customers 
nyfix  inc 
however  our manufactured products contain several custom parts specifi c to our design 
these parts are limited to sheet metal enclosures and interna l wiring 
we own the designs for these components and can source them fro m multiple vendors in our immediate area or throughout the us currently w e maintain relationships with a minimum of two alternate vendors for cabling an d sheet metal  either of which can deliver components within standard deliver y cycles 
for both of these components we use vendors such as ctc  advantage shee t metal and interface technology 
although we maintain relationships with numerou s vendors for our manufactured products  if we are unable to obtain third part y delivery and support on a timely and reliable basis  our ability to provide ou r product and services could be hindered 
we rely on a number of third parties to supply software and systems  a s well as equipment and related maintenance 
our systems are built using a numbe r of commonly used technologies 
as an example  we use systems from emc  sun micr o systems  oracle  sybase  veritas and microsoft 
our products are subject t o potential defects in these third party components 
although we as well as th e individual vendors exercise strict testing and verification of systems an d software  defects can cause disruptions of customer service 
we have invested i n various test systems to make sure supplier s components work as well as ou r developed software 
since we depend on third parties to supply us with underlying softwar e and systems on a reliable  timely basis  we maintain service and maintenanc e agreements with all our main vendors 
we have standard service agreements a t different levels  depending on how critical the vendor s system is to th e operation of our business 
for most systems we have a high level of redundancy which gives us less time critical dependency on a particular vendor 
we hav e service and maintenance agreements with all above mentioned vendors 
because o f the diversity in vendors  there is no dependence on a single vendor 
however  i f we are unable to obtain third party support and delivery on a timely an d reliable basis  our ability to perform services could be hindered and th e relationships we have with our customers could be harmed 
our products may suffer from defects or errors  which may harm our reputation o r subject us to product liability claims 
the products we offer are inherently complex 
despite testing an d quality control  current versions  new versions or enhancements of our product s may contain errors 
any errors  slowdown or failure in our products may harm ou r reputation or subject us to product liability claims 
significant technica l challenges also arise with our products because our customers purchase an d integrate them with a number of third party computer applications and software such integration may not always be successful 
any defects or errors that ar e discovered after commercial release could result in the loss of revenue or dela y in market acceptance of our products 
moreover  we could face higher developmen t costs if our products contain undetected errors  or if we fail to meet ou r customers expectations 
although we maintain general liability insuranc e coverage  this coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms o r at all 
in addition  a product liability claim  whether or not successful  coul d harm our business by increasing our costs and distracting our management 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights  which coul d weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenues and increase our costs 
our success and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degre e on our intellectual property rights  which includes our proprietary technology trade secrets and client base 
however  no one patent  trademark or other for m of intellectual property rights is critical to our business 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorize d parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products o r technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and w e nyfix  inc 
cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use o f our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protec t our proprietary rights as fully as in the us if competitors are able to us e our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
litigatio n may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  t o protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of th e proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement o r invalidity 
litigation  whether or not successful  could result in substantia l costs and diversions of resources 
we may in the future receive notices of claims of infringement of othe r parties proprietary rights 
we cannot assure you that claims of infringement o r invalidity  or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted or prosecuted against us 
any such claims  with or withou t merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  diver t management s attention and resources or require us to enter into royalty o r licensing agreements 
we cannot assure you that these royalties or license s would be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
conducting business in international markets subjects us to additional risks 
for the years ended december   and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from our internationa l operations 
although we have recently relied less on international revenue  w e believe it will be an important component for our future success 
thus  we ar e subject to risks inherent in doing business in international markets  including o difficulties in recruiting and retaining personnel and managin g international operations  o a high degree of costs associated with servicing smaller nationa l markets  and o fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
any of the above could affect the profitability of our internationa l operations or hinder our ability to expand further internationally 
a decline in subscription revenue  our largest source of revenue  or transactio n revenue would adversely affect our profitability 
subscription revenue is our most significant source of revenue subscription revenue is fixed based on a contractual period of time  typicall y one to three years  and are not affected by trading volumes 
however  tradin g volumes do affect the revenues of our customers and this could affect thei r future purchases of our technology and services 
pricing pressures due t o competition  failure to sign new agreements with customers because of reduction s in their new technology spending  and observed consolidation in the financia l sector could affect our revenues and profitability 
our costs associated wit h supporting the subscription agreements are generally fixed and thus a loss o f revenue would impact profitability 
transaction revenue has been a growing component of our revenue however  there is no assurance we can continue to grow transaction revenue 
a s our costs to support transaction revenue are generally fixed  a decline i n revenue would directly impact our profitability 
several risk factors apply t o the analysis of the potential growth of transaction revenue 
there is significant competitive pressure brought on by a proliferatio n of electronic execution competitors 
there is the potential for changes in th e current us market structure that may make it difficult for the transactio n business to compete with more traditional broker dealer business models 
fo r example  the nyse could establish limits on electronic access  or the nyse coul d create an electronic matching order engine of their own 
customer demands for increased bandwidth and speed could plac e significant stress on our infrastructure requiring continued reinvestment i n nyfix  inc 
hardware and software to keep pace with overall business growth 
we have n o current plans to transition from the subscription or transaction based revenu e model due to general acceptance of it in the marketplace and the current tren d of recurring  predictable revenue recognition and cash flows 
the securities brokerage industry is subject to extensive government regulation if nyfix millennium or nyfix transaction services fail to comply with thes e regulations  they may be subject to disciplinary or other action by regulator y organizations 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and may be subject t o disciplinary or other action by regulatory organizations if we fail to compl y with such regulation  which could increase our capital expenditures and decreas e our earnings 
nyfix millennium and nyfix transaction services are subject to extensiv e regulation under both federal and state laws 
in addition to these laws  we mus t comply with rules of the securities and exchange commission sec  includin g regulation ats for nyfix millennium  and the national association of securitie s dealers  inc nasd  various stock exchanges  state securities commissions an d other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of th e securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests o f investors participating in these markets 
as registered broker dealers  nyfi x millennium and nyfix transaction services are subject to numerous regulation s covering the securities business  including o marketing practices  o capital structure  including net capital requirements  o record keeping  and o conduct of directors  officers and employees 
any failure to comply with these regulations could subject nyfi x millennium and nyfix transaction services to censure  fines  the issuance o f cease and desist orders or the suspension  and or disqualification of it s officers  directors or employees 
the fines  if material  could have an advers e effect on our earnings because it could greatly increase our capita l expenditures 
if any of our employees were suspended or disqualified  we may b e unable to meet the needs of our clients or to solicit new business 
this coul d also have an adverse effect on our earnings 
furthermore  any such penaltie s could materially harm our reputation in the industry  which could have a long term effect on our financial growth 
nyfix millennium s and nyfix transaction services compliance and ris k management methods may not be effective 
nyfix millennium s and nyfix transaction services ability to compl y with regulations depends largely on the establishment and maintenance of a n effective compliance system  as well as their ability to attract and retai n qualified compliance personnel 
nyfix millennium and nyfix transaction service s could be subject to disciplinary or other actions due to claimed noncomplianc e with regulations in the future 
if a claim of noncompliance is made by a regulatory authority  the efforts of the management of nyfix millennium an d nyfix transaction services could be diverted to responding to such claim an d nyfix millennium and nyfix transaction services could be subject to a range o f possible consequences  including the payment of fines  civil lawsuits and th e suspension of one or more portions of its business 
in addition  their mode o f operation and profitability may be directly affected by o additional legislation  o changes in rules promulgated by the sec  the nasd  the board o f governors of the federal reserve system  the various stock exchange s or other self regulatory organizations  or nyfix  inc 
o changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws an d rules 
in addition  nyfix millennium s status as a recognized ats requires tha t its trade execution and communication systems be able to handle anticipate d present and future peak trading volumes
