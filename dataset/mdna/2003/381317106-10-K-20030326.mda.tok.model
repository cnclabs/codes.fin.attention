competition and other matters the company experiences strong competition in both attracting deposits and making real estate loans 
competition for savings deposits has historically come from other savings institutions  commercial banks  credit unions  the equities market  mutual funds  issuers of government and corporate debt securities  securities dealers  insurance companies  and other financial services providers 
the principal methods used by the company to attract deposits  in addition to the interest rates and terms offered  include the offering of a variety of free financial services  the convenience of over office locations  and easy access to wsb s products and services over the internet at www 
worldsavings 
com 
competition in making real estate loans comes principally from other savings institutions  mortgage banking companies  and commercial banks 
many of the nation s largest savings institutions  mortgage banking companies  and commercial banks are headquartered or have a significant number of branch offices in the areas in which the company competes 
the primary factors in competing for real estate loans are interest rates  loan fee charges  underwriting standards  and the quality of service to borrowers and their representatives 
in addition  the company competes indirectly with government sponsored enterprises  notably the fnma and the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
changes in the government s monetary  tax  or housing financing policies can also affect the ability of lenders to compete profitably 
thrift industry the operations of the thrift industry are significantly influenced by general economic conditions  by the related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and by the policies of financial institution regulatory authorities 
deposit flows and costs of funds are impacted by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending and other investment activities are affected by the demand for mortgage financing and for consumer and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting the supply of housing and the availability of funds 
regulation office of thrift supervision 
because they are federally chartered savings institutions  both wsb and wtx are regulated principally by the ots 
under various regulations of the ots  savings institutions are required  among other things  to pay assessments to the ots  maintain required regulatory capital  maintain a satisfactory level of liquid assets  and to comply with various limitations on loans to one borrower  equity investments  investments in real estate  and investments in corporate debt securities that are not investment grade and comply with regulations governing deposits and mortgage loans 
federal deposit insurance corporation 
the fdic administers two separate deposit insurance funds  the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif 
each fund insures deposit accounts up to the maximum amount permitted by law  currently  per insured depositor 
initially  the bif was a deposit insurance fund for commercial banks  federally chartered savings banks  and some state chartered savings banks and the saif was a deposit insurance fund for most other savings associations 
through the years  there has developed considerable overlap between the funds 
wsb is a member of the bif  but a portion of wsb s deposits are insured through the saif 
at december   of wsb s deposits were saif insured 
wtx s deposits are also insured by the fdic and wtx is a member of the bif 
fdic insurance is required for all federally chartered financial institutions such as wsb and wtx 
fdic insurance may be terminated by the fdic under certain circumstances involving violations of regulations or unsound practices 
during  federal legislation was enacted to capitalize the saif in order to bring it into parity with the bif 
the new law required members to pay a levy of billion to bring the saif up to the required reserve level of of insured deposits  but lowered thrift deposit insurance premiums for saif members starting in as a result of this legislation  the company incurred a one time charge of million during the premiums paid for the years through were adjusted quarterly and premiums paid starting were adjusted semi annually 
as of december   the premium paid by wsb and wtx to the fdic was an annual rate of 
per  of deposits 
federal reserve board 
federal reserve board regulations require financial institutions to maintain noninterest earning reserves against their checking accounts 
the balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the federal reserve board may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements 
wsb and wtx are currently in compliance with all applicable federal reserve board reserve requirements 
savings institutions have authority to borrow from the federal reserve bank but the federal reserve board requires savings institutions to exhaust all fhlb sources before borrowing from the relevant federal reserve bank 
regulatory capital 
the financial institutions reform  recovery  and enforcement act of firrea established capital standards for federally insured financial institutions  such as wsb and wtx 
under firrea  savings institutions must have tangible capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets  have core capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets  and have risk based capital equal to at least of risk weighted assets 
the ots and other bank regulatory agencies have established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the rules provide that a savings association is well capitalized if its leverage ratio is or greater  its tier risk based capital ratio is or greater  its total risk based capital ratio is or greater and the institution is not subject to a capital directive 
as used herein  the total risk based capital ratio is the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets  the tier risk based capital ratio is the ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets  and the tier or leverage ratio is the ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets  in each case as calculated in accordance with current ots capital regulations 
as of december   the most recent notification from the ots categorized wsb and wtx as well capitalized under the current requirements 
there are no conditions or events that have occurred since that notification that the company believes would have an impact on the categorization of wsb or wtx 
at december  and  wsb and wtx had the following regulatory capital calculated in accordance with firrea s capital standards table regulatory capital ratios  minimum capital requirements  and well capitalized capital requirements as of december  dollars in thousands well capitalized minimum capital capital actual requirements requirements capital ratio capital ratio capital ratio wsb and subsidiaries tangible   tier core or leverage    tier risk based   total risk based    wtx tangible   tier core or leverage    tier risk based   total risk based    table regulatory capital ratios  minimum capital requirements  and well capitalized capital requirements as of december  dollars in thousands well capitalized minimum capital capital actual requirements requirements capital ratio capital ratio capital ratio wsb and subsidiaries tangible   tier core or leverage    tier risk based   total risk based    tangible   tier core or leverage    tier risk based   total risk based    the table below shows a reconciliation of wsb s equity capital to regulatory capital at december  table world savings bank  fsb and subsidiaries reconciliation of equity capital to regulatory capital dollars in thousands core tier total equity tangible tangible leverage risk based risk based capital capital equity capital capital capital common stock paid in surplus  retained earnings  unrealized gain on securities after tax  equity capital       non includable subsidiary      unrealized gain on securities after tax      non qualifying mortgage servicing rights      general valuation allowance  regulatory capital      total assets  adjusted total assets    risk weighted assets   capital ratio actual regulatory capital ratio requirements well capitalized  equal to or greater than the table below shows a reconciliation of wsb s equity capital to regulatory capital at december  table world savings bank  fsb and subsidiaries reconciliation of equity capital to regulatory capital dollars in thousands core tier total equity tangible tangible leverage risk based risk based capital capital equity capital capital capital common stock paid in surplus  retained earnings  unrealized gain on securities after tax  equity capital       direct investments  unrealized gain on securities after tax      general valuation allowance  qualifying subordinated debt  regulatory capital      total assets  adjusted total assets    risk weighted assets   capital ratio actual regulatory capital ratio requirements well capitalized  equal to or greater than the table below shows a reconciliation of wtx s equity capital to regulatory capital at december  table world savings bank  fsb texas reconciliation of equity capital to regulatory capital dollars in thousands core tier total equity tangible tangible leverage risk based risk based capital capital equity capital capital capital common stock paid in surplus  retained earnings  equity capital       general valuation allowance regulatory capital      total assets  adjusted total assets    risk weighted assets   capital ratio actual regulatory capital ratio requirements well capitalized  equal to or greater than the table below shows a reconciliation of wtx s equity capital to regulatory capital at december  table world savings bank  fsb texas reconciliation of equity capital to regulatory capital dollars in thousands core tier total equity tangible tangible leverage risk based risk based capital capital equity capital capital capital common stock paid in surplus  retained earnings  equity capital       general valuation allowance regulatory capital      total assets  adjusted total assets    risk weighted assets   capital ratio actual regulatory capital ratio requirements well capitalized  equal to or greater than federal home loan bank system 
the fhlb system provides credit to its members  which include savings institutions  commercial banks  insurance companies  credit unions  and certain other entities 
each fhlb has joint and several liability for the obligations of the eleven other fhlbs in the system 
wsb is a member of the fhlb of san francisco and wtx is a member of the fhlb of dallas 
as members  wsb and wtx may obtain advances borrowings from  and must own capital stock of  their respective fhlb 
advances are secured by collateral pledges and a blanket lien on the assets of the institution 
in the event a member bank  such as wsb or wtx  defaults on an advance  the federal home loan bank act establishes priority of the fhlb s claim over various other claims 
wsb and wtx must own an amount of capital stock that depends generally upon their outstanding fhlb advances 
in the event a fhlb falls below its minimum capital requirements  the fhlb may require its members to purchase additional capital stock of the fhlb 
capital distributions by savings institutions 
see item  market for registrant s common stock and related stockholder matters on page  for a discussion on certain limitations imposed by the ots on dividends paid by savings institutions 
during  wsb paid million in upstream dividends to golden west 
limitation on loans to one borrower 
current law subjects savings institutions to the same loans to one borrower restrictions that are applicable to national banks with limited provisions for exceptions 
in general  the national bank standard restricts loans to a single borrower to no more than of a bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus  plus an additional if the loan is collateralized by certain readily marketable collateral 
real estate is not included in the definition of readily marketable collateral 
at december   the maximum that wsb could have loaned to one borrower and related entities was million  while the largest amount of loans it had to one borrower was million 
at december   the maximum amount that wtx could have loaned to one borrower and related entities was million  while the largest amount of loans wtx had outstanding to any one borrower was million 
depositor priorities 
in the event of the appointment of a receiver of a federally chartered savings bank  such as wsb  based upon the failure of the savings bank to meet certain minimum capital requirements or the existence of certain other conditions  the federal deposit insurance act recognizes a priority in favor of holders of insured withdrawable deposits including the fdic subrogee or transferee over general creditors including holders of certain debt of wsb 
thus  in the event of a liquidation of wsb or a similar event  claims for insured deposits would have a priority over claims of holders of certain debt 
as of december   wsb had approximately billion of deposits outstanding 
powers of the fdic in connection with the insolvency of an insured depository institution 
if the fdic is appointed a receiver or conservator of an insured depository institution  such as wsb or wtx  the fdic may disaffirm or repudiate any contract or lease to which such institution is a party  the performance of which is determined to be burdensome  and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined to promote the orderly administration of the institution s affairs 
the fdic may contend that its power to repudiate contracts extends to obligations such as the debt of the depository institution  and at least one court has held that the fdic can repudiate publicly traded debt obligations 
the effect of any such repudiation could be to accelerate the maturity of debt 
such repudiation would likely result in a claim by each holder of debt against the receivership 
the claim may be for principal and interest accrued through the date of the appointment of the conservator or receiver 
alternatively  at least one court has held that the claim would be in the amount of the fair market value of the debt as of the date of the repudiation  which amount could be more or less than accrued principal and interest 
the amount paid on the claims of the holders of the debt would depend  among other factors  upon the amount of receivership assets available for the payment of unsecured claims and the priority of the claim relative to the claims of other unsecured creditors and depositors  and may be less than the amount owed to the holders of the debt 
see depositor priorities above 
if the maturity of the debt were so accelerated  and a claim relating to the debt paid by the receivership  the holders of the debt might not be able  depending upon economic conditions  to reinvest any amounts paid on the debt at a rate of interest comparable to that paid on the debt 
in addition  although the holders of the debt may have the right to accelerate the debt in the event of the appointment of a conservator or receiver of the depository institution  the fdic as conservator or receiver may enforce most types of contracts  including debt contracts pursuant to their terms  notwithstanding any such acceleration provision 
the fdic as conservator or receiver may also transfer to a new obligor any of the depository institution s assets and liabilities  without the approval or consent of the institution s creditors 
in its resolutions of the problems of an insured depository institution in default or in danger of default  the fdic is generally obligated to satisfy its obligations to insured depositors at the least possible cost to the deposit insurance fund 
in addition  the fdic may not take any action that would have the effect of increasing the losses to the relevant deposit insurance fund by protecting depositors for more than the insured portion of deposits generally  or by protecting creditors other than depositors 
existing law authorizes the fdic to settle all uninsured and unsecured claims in the insolvency of an insured institution by making a final payment after the declaration of insolvency 
such a payment would constitute full payment and disposition of the fdic s obligations to claimants 
existing law provides that the rate of such final payment is to be a percentage reflecting the fdic s receivership recovery experience

almost all of the company s arms have rates that change monthly and are tied to one of the following three indexes the eleventh district cost of funds index cofi  which is equal to the monthly average cost of deposits and borrowings of savings institution members of the federal home loan bank system s eleventh district  which is composed of california  arizona  and nevada 
the golden west cost of savings index cosi  which is equal to the monthend weighted average rate paid on the company s deposits 
the certificate of deposit index codi  which is equal to the month rolling average of the monthly average of the three month certificate of deposit rate as published in the federal reserve h statistical report 
asset liability management the company s earnings depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the amounts it receives from interest earned on loans  mbs  and investments and the amounts it pays in interest on deposits and borrowings 
therefore  the company s profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage interest rate risk 
the company manages interest rate risk by managing the repricing of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy see interest rate swaps on page 
such instruments are entered into primarily to alter the repricing characteristics of designated assets and liabilities 
the company is subject to interest rate risk to the extent its assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts 
the disparity between the repricing maturity  prepayment  or interest rate change of mortgage loans  including mbs  and investments and the repricing of deposits and borrowings can have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the difference between the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities is commonly referred to as the gap 
the gap table on the following page shows that  as of december   the company s assets reprice faster than its liabilities 
if all repricing assets and liabilities responded equally to changes in the interest rate environment  then gap analysis would suggest that golden west s earnings would rise when interest rates increase and would fall when interest rates decrease 
however  the changes in golden west s earnings are also affected by the built in reporting and repricing lags inherent in the adjustable rate mortgage indexes used by the company 
reporting lags occur because of the time it takes to gather the data needed to compute the indexes 
repricing lags occur because it may take a period of time before changes in interest rates are significantly reflected in the indexes 
cofi  which is the index golden west uses to determine the rate on billion of its existing adjustable rate mortgages  has a two month reporting lag 
as a result  the cofi in effect in any month actually reflects the eleventh district s cost of funds at the level it was two months prior 
the cofi repricing lag occurs because cofi is based on a portfolio of accounts  not all of which reprice immediately 
many of these liabilities  including certificates of deposit  do not reprice each month and  when they do reprice  may not reflect the full change in market rates 
some liabilities  such as low rate checking or passbook savings accounts  may reprice by only small amounts 
still other liabilities  such as noninterest bearing deposits  do not reprice at all 
therefore  cofi does not fully reflect a change in market interest rates 
cosi has a one month reporting lag 
cosi also has a repricing lag  because the rates paid on many of the deposits that make up cosi do not respond immediately or fully to a change in market interest rates 
codi has a one month reporting lag 
codi also has a repricing lag  because the index is a month rolling average and consequently trails changes in short term market interest rates 
partially offsetting the index reporting and repricing lags are similar lags on a portion of the company s liabilities

b includes cash in banks and federal home loan bank fhlb stock 
c deposits with no maturity date  such as checking  passbook  and money market deposit accounts  are assigned zero months 
in addition to the index lags  other elements of arm loans also have an impact on earnings 
these elements are introductory fixed rates on new arm loans  the interest rate adjustment frequency of arm loans  interest rate caps or limits on individual rate changes  and interest rate floors 
when the interest rate environment changes  the index lags and arm structural features cause assets to reprice more slowly than liabilities  enhancing earnings when rates are falling and holding down earnings when rates rise

total        a the total weighted average interest rate for variable loans receivable reflects loans with introductory rates in effect at december  those loans are assumed to mature outside the introductory period at fully indexed rates the fully indexed rate is equal to the effective index plus the loan margin 
consequently  the weighted average rate of all maturing variable rate loans will not equal the weighted average rate of total variable rate loans at december  as indicated in the total balance column 
b deposits with no maturity are included in the column 
golden west estimates the sensitivity of the company s net interest income  net earnings  and capital ratios to interest rate changes and anticipated growth based on simulations using an asset liability model which takes into account the lags previously described 
the simulation model projects net interest income  net earnings  and capital ratios based on a significant interest rate increase that is sustained for a thirty six month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
for mortgage assets  the model incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on prepayment rates  which are based on the company s historical prepayment information 
the model factors in projections for anticipated activity levels by products offered by the company 
based on the information and assumptions in effect at december   a basis point rate increase sustained over a thirty six month period would not affect the company s long term profitability and financial strength

during the first half of  the company desecuritized billion of federal national mortgage association fnma mbs that were classified as mbs held to maturity with recourse and the underlying loans were reclassified to loans receivable 
this desecuritization led to a significant decrease in the outstanding balance of mbs  which in turn contributed to lower mbs repayments and lower interest on mortgage backed securities 
the desecuritization also contributed to an increase in the outstanding balance of loans receivable and an increase in interest on loans

allowance for loan losses the company provides specific valuation allowances for losses on major loans when impaired  and a write down on foreclosed real estate when any significant and permanent decline in value is identified 
the company also utilizes a methodology for monitoring and estimating probable loan losses that is based on both the company s historical loss experience in the loan portfolio and factors reflecting current economic conditions 
this approach uses a database that identifies losses on loans and foreclosed real estate from past years to the present  broken down by year of origination  type of loan  and geographical area 
this approach also takes into consideration current trends in economic growth  unemployment  housing market activity  and home prices for the nation and individual geographical regions 
this approach further considers the impact of other events such as natural disasters 
based on the analysis of historical performance  current conditions  and other risks  management estimates a range of loss allowances by type of loan and risk category to cover probable losses in the portfolio 
one to four single family real estate loans are evaluated as a group 
in addition  periodic reviews are made of major multi family and commercial real estate loans and foreclosed real estate 
where indicated  valuation allowances are established or adjusted 
in estimating probable losses  consideration is given to the estimated sale price  cost of refurbishing the security property  payment of delinquent taxes  cost of disposal  and cost of holding the property 
additions to and reductions from the allowances are reflected in current earnings based upon quarterly reviews of the portfolio and the review methodology and historical analyses are reviewed quarterly

the financial institutions reform  recovery  and enforcement act of firrea established capital standards for federally insured financial institutions  such as wsb and wtx 
under firrea  thrifts and savings banks must have tangible capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets  have core capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets  and have risk based capital equal to at least of risk weighted assets 
the ots and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules based upon five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the rules provide that a financial institution is well capitalized if its leverage ratio is or greater  its tier risk based capital ratio is or greater  its total risk based capital ratio is or greater and the institution is not subject to a capital directive 
as used herein  the total risk based capital ratio is the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets  tier risk based capital ratio is the ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets  and the tier or leverage ratio is the ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets  in each case as calculated in accordance with current ots capital regulations 
as of december   the most recent notification from the ots categorized wsb and wtx as well capitalized under the current requirements 
there are no conditions or events that have occurred since that notification that the company believes would have an impact on the categorization of wsb or wtx

in general  wsb may  with prior notice to the ots  make capital distributions during a calendar year in an amount equal to that year s net income plus retained net income for the preceding two years  as long as immediately after such distributions it remains at least adequately capitalized 
capital distributions in excess of such amount  or which would cause wsb to no longer be adequately capitalized  require specific ots approval

uses of estimates golden west s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
most of golden west s assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses are reported using actual results for the reporting period 
however  gaap requires that certain assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses be reported using estimates of fair value that are based on a variety of assumptions  including such items as future interest rate levels and repayments rates 
as a consequence  assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses reported using fair value estimates may fluctuate from one reporting period to the next because of changes in the business environment that lead to revisions to the assumptions underlying the fair value calculations 
the following is a discussion of the most critical accounting policies involving the use of estimates which senior management discussed with the company s audit committee 
an important use of estimates occurs when the company establishes its allowance for loan losses 
an in depth discussion can be found in the allowance for loan losses section on page as of december   golden west s consolidated statement of financial condition reflected fair value estimates for equity and debt securities available for sale and for purchased mortgage backed securities available for sale as follows 
equity securities available for sale amounted to million and million at yearend and  respectively  compared with amortized costs of million at yearends and  respectively

in addition  upon the adoption of sfas on january   golden west reported a one time pre tax charge of million associated with the initial valuation of the company s interest rate swap portfolio 
for the year ended december   these fair value changes related to sfas were the principal fair value items affecting golden west s earnings

golden west s cmsrs have never experienced impairment 
golden west s cmsr balances amounted to million and million at yearend and  respectively

net interest income the largest component of the company s revenue and earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on loans and other investments and the interest paid on customer deposits and borrowings 
long term growth of the company s net interest income  and hence earnings  is related to the ability to expand the mortgage portfolio  the company s primary earning asset  by originating and retaining high quality adjustable rate home loans 
over the short term  however  net interest income can be influenced by business conditions  especially movements in short term interest rates  which can temporarily increase or reduce changes in net interest income 
net interest income amounted to billion  billion  and billion for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these amounts represented   and increases  respectively  over the previous years 
as discussed below  the significant growth of net interest income in compared with the prior year resulted from both the expansion of the company s average primary spread  which is the difference between the yield on loans and other investments and the rate paid on deposits and borrowings 
the average primary spread for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
the significant growth of net interest income in compared with the prior year resulted from two principal factors the substantial growth of the mortgage portfolio during  and an increase in in the company s primary spread 
between december  and december   the company s earning asset balance increased by billion or 
this growth resulted from strong mortgage originations which more than offset loan repayments and loan sales 
net interest income in benefited from the growth of the mortgage portfolio in the prior year 
specifically  in  the company originated a record loan volume that  in combination with a moderate level of mortgage repayments  resulted in unusually rapid growth of the company s loans receivable 
thus  there was a significantly larger average loan balance outstanding during versus  and this contributed to the substantial net interest income increase in as noted in the discussion of the gap on page  the company s liabilities respond more rapidly to movements in short term interest rates than the company s assets  most of which are adjustable rate mortgages tied to indexes that lag changes in market interest rates 
consequently  when short term interest rates decline  the company s primary spread temporarily widens  because the index lags slow the downward movement of the yield on the company s adjustable rate mortgage portfolio 
when interest rates stabilize after a period of falling rates  the primary spread usually declines for a while until the yield on the arm portfolio catches up to previous rate decreases 
the opposite occurs when interest rates increase 
specifically  when short term interest rates move up  the company s primary spread compresses for a period of time  because the index lags slow the upward adjustment of the yield on the company s arms 
when interest rates stabilize after a period of rising rates  the primary spread expands for a while until the arm yield catches up to previous rate increases 
for the five years ended december   which included periods of both falling and rising interest rates  the company s primary spread averaged with a monthend high of and a monthend low of 
during  the federal reserve s open market committee lowered the federal funds rate  a key short term interest rate  by a total of basis points in order to stimulate the then weak economy 
other short term market rates experienced similar decreases 
in response to significantly lower short term interest rates  the company s cost of funds declined by basis points during at the same time  the yield on the company s assets fell by only basis points  because the indexes to which the large adjustable rate mortgage portfolio is tied moved down more slowly 
as a consequence  the company s primary spread widened substantially during  and at december  reaching  the highest in the company s history 
during  the company s cost of funds declined by an additional basis points 
at the same time  the company s asset yield fell by basis points  as the arm indexes continued to adjust downward in response to the large interest rate declines experienced in because the yield on earning assets fell faster than the cost of funds in  the company s primary spread narrowed from at december  to at december  however  the average primary spread in was greater that the average reported in  contributing to the increase in net interest income for as compared with in november  the federal reserve s open market committee lowered the federal funds rate by an additional basis points to 
because this action occurred near the end of  the rate decrease had a minimal impact on golden west s earnings asset yield  cost of funds  and primary spread at yearend the following table shows the components of the company s primary spread at the end of the years through table yield on earning assets  cost of funds  and primary spread december yield on loan portfolio yield on investments yield on earning assets cost of deposits cost of borrowings cost of funds primary spread interest rate swaps the company enters into interest rate swaps as a part of its interest rate risk management strategy

after tax per diluted share for the year ended december   as compared to pre tax expense of million  or 
after tax per diluted share for the year ended december  this additional income and expense occurred because the fair value of golden west s swaps changed in and as a result of interest rate movements and maturities of interest rate swaps
