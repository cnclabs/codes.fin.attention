overview we were incorporated in december we were engaged principally in research and development from inception through september when we began volume shipments of our first voice communications product  the soundstation 
in the second quarter of and the fourth quarter of  we completed our acquisitions of circa communications  ltd  or circa  and atlanta signal processors  incorporated  or aspi  respectively 
these acquisitions added to our voice communications product line which currently consists of the soundstation  voicestation  soundpoint  vortex and voip product families 
in january  we completed the acquisition of viavideo communications  inc  or viavideo  a development stage company that designed and developed high quality  low cost  easy to use  group video communications systems 
in february  we began customer shipments of our viewstation products 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our acquisition of picturetel corporation  adding to our video communications product line which currently consists of the viewstation  ipower  visual concert  gms and viavideo product families 
in december  we acquired atlas communication engines  inc  or atlas  a privately held oem supplier of integrated access devices  or iads  and an emerging supplier of digital subscriber line  or dsl  routers which provide voice and data over dsl networks 
in january  we sold this product line to verilink corporation see recent developments above 
our network access product offerings were comprised of our netengine line of iads and dsl routers 
in february  we acquired accord networks ltd  or accord  a leading provider of next generation  rich media network products that enable internet protocol and other network voice and video communications in both the customer premises and service provider markets 
accord s products were our initial network systems product offerings 
in the second quarter of  we completed our acquisition of meetu 
com  inc  or meetu  adding to our network systems product line which currently consists of the mgc and gw  voice bridge  pathnavigator and weboffice product families which provide multipoint video connectivity and gateway capability through disparate networks 
our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  include the effects of the picturetel  circa and aspi acquisitions 
meetu is included in our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows from june   the date of acquisition 
in fiscal  we derived a substantial majority of our net revenues from sales of our viewstation  ipower  network systems and soundstation products and ipower related services 
we anticipate that our video communications products  network systems  voice communications products and ipower related services will account for a substantial majority of our net revenues for at least the next twelve months 
any factor adversely affecting the demand or supply for these products would harm our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
in fiscal  our network systems segment contributed more to our profitability  as a percentage of net revenues  than our communications segment due principally to higher gross margins on the network systems products 
the network access segment had negative gross margins 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for the three years ended december  the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net revenues  consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated 
year ended december  net revenues cost of net revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquisition related costs purchased in process research and development amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of goodwill restructure costs grant repayment litigation settlement litigation reserve release total operating expenses operating income loss interest income  net loss on strategic investments other income expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss net revenues net revenues for the year ended december  increased over the same period of net revenues for the year ended december   in the communications and network systems segments  increased and  respectively  while the network access segment decreased over the same period in the increase in communications was due primarily to increased sales volume of our video communications products and ipower related services 
the video communications products net revenues increased to million for from million in although the viewstation product line contributed to the increase in video communications net revenues  this growth was primarily due to the addition of the ipower video product line added through the acquisition of picturetel in october due to the timing of this acquisition  ipower product revenue is reflected in the prior year numbers only for the fourth quarter of although overall in  video revenue grew  we experienced sequential quarterly revenue decreases in the second  third and fourth quarters of  primarily related to declines in our video communications product revenue in both the viewstation and ipower product lines 
the ipower related services net revenues was million for the year ended december  compared to million reported in the same period of  as this revenue stream was also added through the acquisition of picturetel 
also contributing to the increase in net revenues was an increase in the service revenue related to our network systems products and an increase in sales of our voice over ip and installed voice products  offset by decreases in sales volumes of our circuit switch voice communications products and decreases in sales in the network access product line for when compared to the installed voice products were added through the acquisition of aspi in the fourth quarter of in  we began to implement a new direct touch strategy in concert with a realignment of our channel partner strategy 
as part of this new channel partner strategy  the channel inventory model is changing to reduce channel inventories to a more optimal level or to a drop shipment method to certain channel partners end user customers 
during the third quarter and fourth quarter of we believe our channel partners video and voice inventory decreased over the second and third quarter of  respectively 
this decrease was due in part to this shift in channel partner strategy resulting in us shipping fewer video and voice units to channel partners in the third and fourth quarter of the decreased channel inventory levels had less impact on sales of ipower units  which are not typically carried in inventory by our channel partners 
on a regional basis  north america  europe  asia and latin america revenues increased   and  respectively  for the year ended december  over the year ended december  included in product revenues for voice  non ipower video and network systems products are immaterial amounts of related service revenue 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased over the same period of net revenues for the year ended december   in the communications  network systems and network access segments  decreased  increased and decreased  respectively  over the same period in the increase in overall revenue was due to increased sales volume of our network systems products which increased from million in to million in  and to ipower related service revenue of million resulting from our acquisition of picturetel in october these increases were offset by decreases in volume of our network access  voice communications and video communications product revenue which decreased  and  respectively  year over year 
the decrease in viewstation product sales was largely offset by ipower product sales in the fourth quarter of we believe that lower sales of our video  voice and network access products for over were due principally to a reduction in capital spending in the united states due to the downturn in economic activity during  which resulted in our channel partners reducing the level of inventory that they typically hold 
on a regional basis  asia and europe revenues increased and respectively  in over while north america and latin america revenues decreased slightly in over included in product revenues for voice  non ipower video and network systems products are immaterial amounts of related service revenue 
a major contributor to the expected growth of the broadband market has been the deployment of dsl 
beginning in the second half of  the market for broadband services experienced a severe downturn  characterized by financial troubles for many telecommunications service providers and delays in delivering broadband services 
this downturn continued through and negatively impacted sales of our network access products 
these dsl providers were customers of our network access products through oem providers that we used as channel partners 
these service delays slowed the expected growth in this market which in turn slowed sales volumes of our network access products 
as a result  network access product revenues decreased in over in january  we made the decision that this business was no longer strategic to our overall product offerings  and sold to verilink corporation certain fixed assets and intellectual property rights relating to our network access product line  including our line of netengine integrated devices  for a total of up to million in cash  of which i million was paid to us at closing  ii million will be paid to us on the first anniversary of the closing  and iii up to million will be paid to us quarterly based on ten percent of verilink s revenues related to sale of netengine products 
as a result of the sale of the network access product line to verilink corporation  we will have no future revenue associated with this product line 
in   and  we derived a substantial majority of our net revenues from sales of our video communication  voice communication and network systems products 
no customer accounted for more than of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended december   and for the year ended december   our network systems segment had two channel partners that represented approximately of network systems segment revenues 
we believe it is unlikely that the loss of one or both of these channel partners would have a material adverse affect on the net revenues of this segment as we believe end users would likely purchase our network systems products from a different channel partner 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for business segment information 
our business is subject to the risks arising from domestic and global economic conditions 
during and  the economic downturn in the united states slowed overall spending to the point where industries delayed or reduced technology purchases 
if this economic downturn and uncertainty in technology spending continues through  as it currently appears to be  it will likely have an adverse effect on our results of operations for if our channel partners delay or reduce orders for our products  we may fall short of our revenue expectations for  as we did in the second and third quarters of  and for the entire year 
further  if these conditions persist  our business and financial performance will continue to be negatively affected as they were in and for example  in the third quarter of  these conditions resulted in sequentially weaker video communications  voice communications  network systems and network access product revenues from the second quarter of the extent of adverse economic conditions in is difficult to predict at this time  which represents a significant uncertainty with respect to our operating results 
in addition  weakness in the end user market for our products could negatively affect the revenue and cash flow of our channel partners who could  in turn  delay orders and delay paying their obligations to us 
this could harm our revenues  profitability  financial condition and cash flow 
further  we believe that our plans to further reduce our channel inventories to a more optimal level may limit revenue growth and may cause a decrease in revenue in the near term  as they did in the fourth quarter of in addition  we plan to continue to implement changes to our channel partner strategy which will result in a smaller number of channel partners  a change in the mix of our channel partners and a shift to a model with more direct interaction between us and our direct end user customers 
these changes may cause additional disruptions in our channels and negatively impact revenue growth in the near term 
international net revenues  or revenues outside of the us and canada  accounted for   and of total net revenues for  and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the absolute dollar increase in the international component of our revenues for over was primarily driven by increased sales volume of our video communications and network systems products in europe  asia and latin america and an increase in network access products in europe and asia 
additionally  international  ipower related services net revenues were million and in and  respectively  as this revenue stream was added through the acquisition of picturetel 
the improvement in international revenues in over was due to growth in asia of sales of our video communications products  growth in asia and europe of sales of our network systems products and by reductions in sales of video  voice and network access products in north america 
in fiscal year  we made investments in europe  asia and  to a lesser degree  in latin america 
this expansion of resources was the main reason for the increase in the international percentage of total net revenues in from despite the increase in net revenue from sales of our network systems products which were sold primarily in north america 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of total net revenues for the foreseeable future  and we plan to continue our expansion in asia and europe 
international sales  however  are subject to certain inherent risks  including potential economic weakness in international markets  political instability  any adverse economic impact of terrorist attacks and incidents and any military response to those attacks  war or other hostilities  changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  export license requirements  tariffs and taxes  other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
significant adverse changes in currency exchange rates  as happened in the european market in and in the asian market in late  could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in revenue or profitability in that country 
additionally  international net revenues may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues in the future as we introduce new products since we expect to initially introduce these products in north america  and also  because of the additional time required for product homologation and regulatory approvals of new products in international markets 
to the extent we are unable to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner our business could be harmed 
we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
additionally  to date  a substantial majority of our international sales have been denominated in us currency 
however  if our international sales were denominated in local currencies in the future  these transactions would be subject to currency fluctuation 
cost of net revenues increase from prior year year end december  in thousands cost    of net revenues cost of net revenues consists primarily of contract manufacturer costs  including material and direct labor  our manufacturing organization  tooling depreciation  warranty expense  freight expense  royalty payments and an allocation of overhead expenses 
the cost of net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal was which is consistent with fiscal overall  margins remained flat as a result of a more favorable product mix generated from increased shipments of higher margin video products and more favorable network access margins due to less write downs of inventory in over  offset by higher service revenue at lower margins 
as a result of the sale of the network access product line to verilink corporation  we will have no future cost of sales associated with this product line 
in fiscal  our network systems segment  as a percentage of net revenues  contributed more to our profitability than our communications segment due principally to higher gross margins on the network systems products 
the network access segment had negative gross margins 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
when comparing the cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues in to  the percentage was again the same at 
overall  a more favorable product mix generated from increased shipments of higher margin network systems products was offset by a write down of network access inventory to net realizable value 
forecasting future gross margin percentages is difficult  and there are a number of risks associated with maintaining our current gross margin levels 
for example  uncertainties surrounding revenue levels and related production level variances  competition  changes in technology  changes in product mix  manufacturing efficiencies of subcontractors  manufacturing and purchased part variances  warranty costs and timing of sales over the next few quarters can cause our cost of net revenues percentage to fluctuate significantly 
additionally  our ipower products  voip products and other desktop products have a significantly higher cost of net revenue percentage than our network systems  viewstation and soundstation products 
accordingly  any significant revenue growth in our ipower  voip and other desktop products will have a negative effect on our cost of net revenues percentages 
also  we may reduce prices on our products in the future for competitive reasons  as a result of a difficult economy or to stimulate demand which could increase our cost of net revenues percentage  and there is the risk that any of these potential price reductions would not offset competitive pressures or stimulate demand 
in addition  cost variances associated with the manufacturing ramp of new products  or the write off of initial inventory purchases due to product launch delays or the lack of market acceptance of our new products such as our ipower series  voiceplus bridging solution  voip telephony products  vtx  viewstation ec  viewstation ex  mgc or any other new product under development could occur  which would increase our cost of net revenues percentage in any quarter 
in addition to the uncertainties listed above  cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues may increase due to a change in our mix of distribution channels and the mix of international versus north american revenues  or revenues from canada and the united states 
sales and marketing expenses increase from prior year year end december  in thousands expenses    of net revenues sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for our sales force  advertising and promotional expenses  product marketing  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
the increase in absolute dollars in over was due primarily to the increase in headcount in our sales force and increased product sales driven largely by the picturetel acquisition in the fourth quarter of and to a lesser extent our focus on the public sector market 
as a result  we had increases in salaries  commissions and headcount related expenses  such as travel 
also contributing to the absolute dollar increase was our overall efforts to expand our marketing efforts  including the addition of a chief marketing officer and related staffing  increased spending on promotional materials  trade shows  and outside consultants 
this increase was partially offset by cost containment measures and expense controls implemented in the second half of due to the continued economic downturn and uncertainty in technology spending 
the increase in absolute dollars in over was due primarily to increased marketing efforts related to our network systems products and to an increase in our investment in our worldwide sales effort 
the sale of the network access product line will not have a significant impact on our sales and marketing expense 
we expect to continue to increase our sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollar amounts as we expand north american and international markets  market new products and expand the public sector market 
further  our acquisitions of picturetel  accord  circa  meetu and aspi expanded our product portfolio into new products and markets which require significant additional marketing expenditures to communicate the value of the new product offerings as well as significant additional sales expenditures to develop our sales organization to market these products 
due to the innovative nature of our products  such as viavideo  viewstation  ipower  mgc  gw  weboffice  pathnavigator  vortex and voip products  we believe we will incur additional expenses for sales and marketing  especially advertising  to expand the overall market for  to drive penetration of  and increase the adoption rate of this technology and our products  and to educate potential end users as to the desirability of these products over competing products 
research and development expenses increase from prior year year end december  in thousands expenses    of net revenues research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  outside services  expensed materials  depreciation and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
increases in research and development expenses occurred for all product lines in both and except network access products  which declined by in over and declined slightly in compared with the and increase in research and development expense as a percentage of net revenues in and  respectively  reflects our continued investments in our existing products as well as new investments in our ipower products  which were acquired through the picturetel acquisition  investments in integrating all of our existing and acquired products and developing new products which were launched in the first quarter of this increase was partially offset by cost containment measures and expense controls implemented in the second half of due to the continued economic downturn and uncertainty in technology spending 
in  individually  video product development expenditures accounted for of the total increase due to the addition of the picturetel research and development team for the full year versus just part of the fourth quarter in  voice product development expenditures accounted for of the total increase  network systems product development expenditures accounted for of the total increase  corporate product development expenses accounted for of the change and the decrease in network access product development expenses accounted for of the change 
in  individually  the increase in network systems product development expenditures accounted for of the total increase  video product development expenditures accounted for of the total increase  voice product development expenditures accounted for of the total increase and the decrease in network access product development accounted for of the change 
we are currently devoting a significant portion of our research and development expenses toward the product lines gained through the picturetel  accord  circa  aspi and meetu acquisitions 
in addition  we are investing research and development resources to enhance and upgrade our polycom office suite of products which provides a complete end to end communications solution 
such products include our viewstation  ipower  gms  mgc  weboffice  pathnavigator  soundstation  voicestation and vortex which provide multipoint video and voice connectivity and gateway capability through disparate networks 
in all years presented  all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
we believe that technological leadership is critical to our success and we are committed to continuing a high level of research and development to develop new technologies and combat competitive pressures 
also  continued investment in new product initiatives will require significant research and development spending 
consequently  we intend to increase research and development expenses in absolute dollars in the future 
as a result of the sale of the network access product line  we will have no future research and development expense associated with this product line 
general and administrative expenses increase from prior year year end december  in thousands expenses    of net revenues general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  professional service fees  allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs  and bad debt expense 
the increase in absolute dollars spending in general and administrative in over was primarily the result of higher costs associated with increased infrastructure costs  outside services  including increased costs associated with regulatory requirements  and an increase in bad debt expense 
this increase was partially offset by cost containment measures and expense controls implemented in the second half of due to the continued economic downturn and uncertainty in technology spending 
individually  the increase in infrastructure costs accounted for of the total increase  outside services accounted for of the total increase  bad debt expense accounted for of the total increase  with the remaining increase related to numerous smaller items 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  over the same period of was due to higher costs associated with increased staffing and other infrastructure costs offset slightly by lower expenditures associated with the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system implemented in and expense controls initiated in we believe that our general and administrative expenses will likely continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts in the future primarily as a result of expansion of our administrative staff and costs related to supporting a larger company  increased costs associated with regulatory requirements and our continued investments in international regions 
these additional expenses principally relate to expansion of our information system and infrastructure charges related to the significant investments being made in international regions 
additionally  predicting the timing of bad debt expense associated with uncollectible receivables is difficult  particularly during the current economic environment  and material charges due to uncollectability of our receivables could increase our general and administrative expenses and negatively affect our profitability in the quarter they are recorded 
the sale of the network access product line will not have any impact on our general and administrative expense 
acquisition related costs we recorded a charge to operations of million in  million in  and million in for acquisition related costs 
for  the acquisition related charges related primarily to the acquisition of picturetel and consisted primarily of professional services costs to complete the integration of the companies 
in  these costs were associated with the acquisitions of accord  circa  picturetel and aspi 
the costs were made up of million of restructuring charges related to facility closings and severance costs  million of asset impairment charges and million of other acquisition costs including outside financial advisory  legal  accounting and consulting services 
in  these costs were related to the acquisition of accord completed in february these charges include the cost of actions designed to improve our combined competitiveness  productivity  and future profitability  and primarily relate to the elimination of redundant and excess facilities and workforce in our combined businesses and the elimination of redundant assets 
if we acquire another business in the future  we may incur material acquisition expenses related to such transactions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchased in process research and development in the years ended december  and  we incurred charges totaling million and million  respectively  for in process research and development 
this research and development was acquired in as part of the acquisition of meetu 
com  inc and in as part of the acquisitions of picturetel  circa and aspi  and comprised million  million and million for each of these respective acquisitions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amounts allocated to purchased in process research and development were determined by management  after considering among other factors  the results of an independent appraisal based on established valuation techniques in the high technology communications industry and were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed for these in process research and development projects 
the cost approach  which uses the concept that replacement cost is an indicator of fair value  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the in process research and development acquired in the meetu transaction 
the cost approach is based on the premise that a prudent investor would pay no more for an asset than the cost to replace that asset with a new one 
replacement cost was based on total costs  net of the unrealized income tax deduction benefit  spent developing the in process technology from meetu s inception through the date the valuation was performed 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the developed technology and in process research and development in the estimated net cash flows from the products are based upon estimates of revenue  cost of revenue  research and development costs  sales and marketing costs and income taxes from such projects and were discounted at rates ranging from to percent in relation to the stage of completion and the technical risks associated with achieving technological feasibility 
our efforts to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet its design specifications including function  features and technical performance requirements 
it is reasonably possible that the development of this technology could fail because of either prohibitive cost  inability to perform the required efforts to complete the technology or other factors outside of our control such as a change in the market for the resulting developed products 
in addition  at such time that the project is completed it is reasonably possible that the completed products do not receive market acceptance or that we are unable to produce and market the product effectively 
the following are the values assigned to each acquired picturetel in process research and development project at the time of acquisition and the estimated completion percentages  expected technology lives and estimated time and costs to complete as of december  in thousands in process research and development project value assigned to in process project percentage complete expected life of technology estimated time to complete estimated cost to complete project a  years complete project b  years complete project c  years months  other projects  years months  total   during  the company completed and shipped product associated with projects a  b and two of the other projects 
the costs to complete these projects were in line with our expectations 
the company terminated one of the other projects and is continuing to develop project c and some smaller other projects 
the remaining projects are for next generation products to enhance pc based voice and video conferencing features 
amortization of purchased intangibles in year ended december   we recorded million in amortization of purchased intangibles acquired in the picturetel  circa  aspi and meetu acquisitions and in the year ended december   we recorded million in amortization of purchased intangibles acquired in the picturetel  circa and aspi acquisitions 
purchased intangible assets are being amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives of three years 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  purchased intangibles no longer meeting the criteria to be recorded separately from goodwill must be reclassified to goodwill  and purchased intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives must no longer be amortized 
in the first quarter of  we reclassified approximately million of unamortized acquired workforce recorded as part of the purchase price allocation of the circa acquisition as it did not meet the criteria to be recorded separately from goodwill 
this resulted in a permanent reduction in amortization expense of  per quarter through the first quarter of also under sfas  intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized 
as a result  we determined that a previously recorded trade name intangible has an indefinite life 
consequently  the trade name intangible is no longer amortized  resulting in a permanent reduction in amortization expense of  per quarter through april in june  we completed the transitional purchased intangible impairment test outlined under sfas which required the assessment of purchased intangibles for impairment as of january  and in october  we completed our annual impairment test 
both of these tests were conducted by determining and comparing the fair value of our reporting units  as defined in sfas  to the reporting unit s carrying value as of that date 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our purchased intangible assets were not impaired as of january  or during amortization of goodwill in the year ended december   we recorded million of amortization of goodwill related to the circa acquisition 
beginning january   under sfas we no longer amortize goodwill related to the circa acquisition 
this resulted in a permanent decrease in goodwill amortization expense of approximately million per quarter through the first quarter of under the transition rules of sfas  business combinations completed after july   but prior to january   were accounted for in accordance with sfas  and consequently  goodwill balances from the picturetel and aspi acquisitions have never been amortized 
in june  we completed the transitional goodwill impairment test outlined under sfas which required the assessment of goodwill for impairment as of january  and in october  we completed our annual impairment test 
both of these tests were conducted by determining and comparing the fair value of our reporting units  as defined in sfas  to the reporting unit s carrying value as of that date 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our goodwill assets were not impaired as of january  or during we plan to conduct our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of every year  unless impairment indicators exist sooner 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill impairment tests 
restructure costs in the third and fourth quarters of  we approved restructuring actions in response to the continued global economic downturn and to improve our overall cost structure by prioritizing resources in strategic areas of the business and reducing operating expenses 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in as a result of these actions 
this charge consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately six percent of our employees worldwide 
as of december   we had paid approximately million of the million charge 
a liability has been recorded in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for the remaining amount which is to be paid through fiscal we expect that  due to these restructuring actions  operating expenses will grow at a much smaller rate than what otherwise would have been  as the headcount affected by the restructuring will be added back over time as our operations expand in connection with the growth of our business 
if the current economic downturn and uncertainty in technology spending continues  we may take additional restructuring actions to reduce our operating expenses  while simultaneously implementing additional cost containment measures and expense control programs 
such restructuring actions are subject to significant risks  including delays in implementing expense control programs or workforce reductions and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or a decrease in employee morale  all of which would impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions 
if we do not achieve the anticipated cost reductions our business could be harmed 
grant repayment in the fourth quarter of  accord incurred a charge of million relating to the repayment of all outstanding grants from the office of the chief scientist in israel  or ocs  and the israel us binational industrial research and development foundation  or bird 
the payments to ocs and bird were derived directly from the commercial success of accord products resulting from research and development funding received from those organizations 
litigation settlement we reached a favorable settlement with a former picturetel customer during the first quarter of the dispute involved certain services provided by picturetel in and amounts owed to us for providing these services 
the amount received was approximately million  net of legal fees incurred to litigate and settle the case 
on november   a patent infringement claim was filed against accord s us subsidiary  accord networks  inc  in the united states district court  district of massachusetts  alleging that the us subsidiary had and was willfully and deliberately infringing on one of ezenia s patents 
the complaint was later amended to allege that the us subsidiary also had and was willfully and deliberately infringing on other patents 
on june   accord was added as a defendant in the lawsuit 
on june   accord and its us subsidiary entered into a written settlement agreement  and the court entered an order dismissing the case 
the lawsuit settlement cost of million  which final payment was made on december   represents a one time charge resulting from this settlement and was reported under litigation settlement in the consolidated statement of operations in june litigation reserve release on september   vtel corporation  or vtel  filed a lawsuit in the state district court in travis county  texas against viavideo communications  inc and its founders  who were formerly employed by vtel 
on may   following our acquisition of viavideo  vtel amended its suit to add polycom as a defendant 
in the lawsuit  vtel alleged breach of contract  breach of confidential relationship  disclosure of proprietary information and related allegations 
viavideo  its founders and polycom answered the suit  denying in their entirety vtel s allegations 
on march   vtel voluntarily dismissed the allegations against polycom and viavideo with prejudice for no consideration 
as a one time item in the first quarter of  the excess accrual associated with the expenses we estimated we would incur in connection with this lawsuit totaling million was released since no further material expenses were to be incurred 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest income  net interest income  net consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments less bank charges resulting from the use of our bank accounts and imputed interest expense related to the present value of costs associated with closing facilities as part of the picturetel acquisition and related integration plan 
imputed interest expense for and was million and  respectively 
interest income  net of interest expense  was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest income decreased in over the comparable period in the prior year due primarily to the imputed interest expense related to facility closings and interest rate reductions resulting from the monetary policy actions taken by the united states federal reserve board to stimulate economic growth in the united states during and partially offsetting these negative effects was an increase in our average cash and investment balances  which was due primarily to our common stock offering which raised million in the first quarter of the average interest rate return on our cash and cash equivalents was and on our investments was in compared to and  respectively  for the increases in interest income  net  in and are due primarily to changes in average cash and investment balances throughout the year  the most significant of which relates to our common stock offering in and accord s initial public offering which together raised million in the third quarter of interest income  net could fluctuate in due to movement in our cash balances and changes in interest rates in related to monetary policy actions taken by the united states federal reserve board to stimulate economic growth in the united states 
loss on strategic investments for strategic reasons we have made various investments in public and private companies in  and the private company investments are carried at cost less any impairment write downs and are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist and make appropriate reductions in carrying value  if necessary 
these private company investments had no carrying value as of december  and a carrying value of million as of december  these investments have been permanently written down a total of million from original cost  including million  million and million in  and  respectively  which is reflected in loss on strategic investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
our strategic public company investments are recorded at fair value in short term investments and long term investments in our consolidated balance sheets and are marked to market each period through unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of stockholders equity  except our warrants to purchase publicly traded equity securities which are marked to market through the statement of operations 
if these investments are sold at a loss or have permanently declined in value  a charge to operations is recorded 
realized gains and losses on these strategic investments are reflected in loss on strategic investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
during and  the company recorded a loss totaling million and million  respectively  related to the sale of its strategic investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies  impairment of equity securities of publicly traded companies and the write down of its warrants to purchase publicly traded equity securities 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision for income taxes in over was attributable to a decrease in nondeductible acquisition related costs and an increase in foreign earnings subject to relatively lower tax rates 
the decrease in the provision for income taxes in over was attributable to a decrease in us tax and an increase in foreign tax due to an increase in foreign income 
as of december   we had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards  million in tax credit carryovers and million in capital loss carryforwards as well as other deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
short term and long term investments consisted primarily of us government securities  state and local government securities and corporate debt and equity securities of which million was invested in equity securities of publicly traded companies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we have a million line of credit with a bank which was unused at december  we generated cash from operating activities totaling million in  million in and million in the increase in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to larger decreases in trade receivables over the prior period  larger increases in taxes payable and a smaller increase in prepaids and other current assets offset partially by smaller reductions in inventories  increases in deferred taxes and larger decreases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities over the comparable period 
when comparing the increase in cash from operating activities in over  improvements were a result of a net reduction in trade receivables  inventories and deferred taxes in compared to increases for these items in and a smaller increase in prepaid and other current assets compared to  offset by a net reduction in total liabilities such as accounts payable  taxes payable and other liabilities and lower net income before non cash items 
the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended was an increase of million 
the primary uses of cash during this period were million of net purchases of investments  million for purchases of property and equipment and million for repurchases of our common stock 
the primary sources of cash were million from operating activities  million of proceeds from our offering  net of issuance costs and million associated with the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
the positive cash from operating activities was primarily the result of net income before considering non cash expenses  such as depreciation  amortization  the provision for doubtful accounts  loss on strategic investments  the write off of purchased in process research and development and the tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options  lower trade receivables and inventories  offset by a net decrease in total liabilities  including accounts payable  taxes payable and other liabilities  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and deferred taxes 
the positive cash impact due to net trade receivables and inventory reductions may not occur in as it did in in february  we completed a public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock  including an over allotment option of  shares exercised by the underwriters  at a price of per share 
our net proceeds from this offering were approximately million after taking into account underwriting discounts and commissions and our expenses 
we intend to use the net proceeds from this sale primarily for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures  as well as for acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies 
in june  the board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock and as of december   we had repurchased approximately  shares for cash of million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company retired and reclassified these shares of common stock as authorized and unissued 
in  we plan to continue to repurchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
at december   we had open purchase orders related to our contract manufacturers and other contractual obligations of approximately million primarily related to inventory purchases 
we also have material commitments that consist of obligations under our operating leases 
in the event that we decided to cease using a facility and seek to sublease such facility or terminate a lease obligation through a lease buyout or other means  we may incur a material cash outflow at the time of such transaction  which will negatively impact our operating results and overall cash flows 
in addition  if facilities rental rates decrease or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  we could incur a significant further charge to operations and our operating and overall cash flows could be negatively impacted in the period that these changes or events occur 
these commitments and obligations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these requested goods or services 
in addition  our bank has issued letters of credit to secure the leases on some of our offices 
these letters of credit total approximately million and are secured by our credit facilities or cash deposits with our banks 
as of december   the following future minimum lease payments  net of sublease income are due under our current lease obligations 
for example  the company has an approximately  square foot building which is fully subleased to a third party for which the sublease runs concurrent with the company s lease obligation 
as a result the company is not currently showing a lease obligation related to this facility 
in addition to these minimum lease payments  we are contractually obligated under the majority of our operating leases to pay certain operating expenses during the term of the lease such as maintenance  taxes and insurance 
this table excludes leases subject to cancellation within twelve months of december  in thousands minimum lease payments projected annual operating costs year ending december  thereafter   minimum future lease payments   we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  investments  and bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may require or desire additional funds to support our operating expenses and capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions or competitive reasons and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us and would not be dilutive 
our future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the introduction of new products and potential acquisitions of related businesses or technology 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our process used to develop estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and product returns we recognize hardware product revenue using the guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements and statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
we recognize software revenue in accordance with the aicpa statement of position no 
 or sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under these guidelines  we defer revenue recognition on transactions where persuasive evidence of an arrangement does not exist  title has not transferred  product payment is contingent upon performance of installation or service obligations  the price is not fixed or determinable or payment is not reasonably assured 
in addition  we estimate what future product returns may occur based upon actual historical return rates and reduce our revenues by these estimated future returns 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  these estimates could be revised 
in addition  we defer revenue associated with long term customer maintenance contracts 
the value of these contracts is recognized ratably over the length of the customer contract 
channel partner programs and incentives we record estimated reductions to revenues for channel partner programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  trade in credits  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline further  we may take actions to increase channel partner incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of hardware product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revision of the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers or channel partners were to deteriorate  particularly in the current economic environment  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required as was the case with global crossing and worldcom in excess and obsolete inventory we write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred and refundable taxes we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against these tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
at december   we had no valuation allowance established against our deferred tax assets 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase combinations the purchase combinations completed require us to identify and estimate the fair value of the assets acquired  including intangible assets other than goodwill  and liabilities assumed in the combinations 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plan for the entities acquired including planned redundancies  restructuring  use of assets acquired and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of obligations assumed for which no future benefit will be received 
for example  in the picturetel acquisition  we identified vacated or redundant facilities that we intended to sublease or negotiate a lease termination settlement 
for all material acquisitions the allocation period  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises  has been completed 
therefore  if actual costs exceed our estimates these charges would be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
if actual costs are less than our estimates  these charges would continue to be recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
goodwill and purchased intangibles we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other identified intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would typically measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we accounted for the picturetel  aspi and meetu acquisitions  all of which were completed after july   under the new guidance  and on january   we ceased to amortize goodwill arising from the circa acquisition which was completed prior to july  we were required to perform a transitional impairment review of our goodwill prior to june  and an impairment review at least annually thereafter 
in june  we completed our transitional goodwill and purchased intangibles impairment tests outlined under sfas which required the assessment of goodwill and purchased intangibles for impairment as of january  and in october  we completed our annual impairment tests 
these tests were conducted by determining and comparing the fair value of our reporting units  as defined in sfas  to the reporting unit s carrying value as of that date 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our goodwill assets and purchased intangible assets were not impaired as of january  or during we plan to conduct our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of every year  unless impairment indicators exist sooner 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill impairment tests 
non marketable securities we periodically make strategic investments  or have acquired these investments through business acquisitions  in companies whose stock is not currently traded on any stock exchange and for which no quoted price exists 
the cost method of accounting is used to account for these investments as we hold a non material ownership percentage 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate to management that an impairment exists may be a significant decrease in the market value of the company  poor or deteriorating market conditions in the public and private equity capital markets  significant adverse changes in legal factors or within the business climate the company operates  and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or projections and forecasts that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the company s future business plans 
impairment indicators identified during the reporting period could result in a significant write down in the carrying value of the investment if we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
these investments had no carrying value as of december   and have been permanently written down a total of million from original cost in  and recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas amends existing accounting guidance on asset impairment and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
among other provisions  the new rules change the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale 
the standard also broadens the scope of businesses to be disposed of that qualify for reporting as discontinued operations  and changes the timing of recognizing losses on such operations 
we adopted sfas effective january  and do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our results of consolidated operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 sfas rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
among other provisions  sfas rescinds sfas no 
 sfas reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
accordingly  gains or losses from extinguishment of debt shall not be reported as extraordinary items unless the extinguishment qualifies as an extraordinary item under the criteria of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
gains or losses from extinguishment of debt that do not meet the criteria of apb no 
should be reclassified to income from continuing operations in all prior periods presented 
we adopted sfas effective january  and do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our results of consolidated operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 sfas accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas provides guidance related to accounting for costs associated with disposal activities covered by sfas or with exit or restructuring activities previously covered by eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas supercedes eitf issue no 
in its entirety 
sfas requires that costs related to exiting an activity or to a restructuring not be recognized until the liability is incurred 
sfas will be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our results of consolidated operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a rollforward of the entity s product warranty liabilities 
we will apply the recognition provisions of fin prospectively to guarantees issued after december  the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements for fiscal year as is customary in our industry  as provided for in local law in the us and other jurisdictions  our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers  such as defense  settlement  or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products 
from time to time  we indemnify customers against combinations of loss  expense  or liability arising from various trigger events related to the sale and the use of our products and services 
in addition  from time to time we also provide protection to customers against claims related to undiscovered liabilities  additional product liability or environmental obligations 
in our experience  claims made under such indemnifications are rare 
we believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our results of consolidated operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have on our results of consolidated operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 sfas accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the annual disclosure requirements of sfas are included in these notes while the transition disclosure requirements are effective for our fiscal we do not expect sfas to have a material effect on our results of consolidated operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we do not expect fin to have a material effect on our results of consolidated operations  financial condition or cash flows 
other factors affecting future operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business could be harmed by any or all of these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and are not a good indicator of future performance 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future as a result of a number of factors  many of which are out of our control 
these factors include difficult general economic conditions  as has been the case with the current economic downturn and uncertainty in technology industries  and specific economic conditions prevailing in the communications industry and other technology industries  the near and long term impact of terrorist attacks and incidents and any military response or uncertainty regarding any military response to those attacks  or the outbreak of war or other hostilities  changes to our channel partner contracts and channel partner strategy  including a change in the number and mix of channel partners  which will result in a smaller number of channel partners and likely reduce channel partner orders  market acceptance of new product introductions  including those products launched in the first quarter of  and product enhancements by us or our competitors  the prices and performance of our products and those of our competitors  the timing and size of the orders for our products  our distribution channels reducing their inventory levels  slowing sales by our channel partners to their customers which places further pressure on our channel partners to minimize inventory levels and reduce purchases of our products  the level and mix of inventory that we hold to meet future demand  the impact of the unstable political situation in israel and recent military action by the israeli government and other hostilities in the middle east and their impact on our israeli operations  the mix of products we sell  fluctuations in the level of international sales and our exposure to international currency fluctuations  the cost and availability of components  manufacturing costs  the level and cost of warranty claims  the impact of disruptions at the sites of our primary manufacturing partners in thailand and israel for any reason  the impact of seasonality on our various product lines and geographic regions  the level of royalties we must pay to third parties  and adverse outcomes to intellectual property claims 
we experienced sequential quarterly revenue growth from through since that time we have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to these or other factors 
these and other factors could further prevent us from attaining or sustaining sequential quarterly growth or meeting our expectations  and investors should not use our past results to predict future operating margins and results 
for example  we experienced sequential quarterly revenue decreases in the second  third and fourth quarters of  primarily related to declines in our video communications product revenue 
in addition  we incurred a significant net loss in due to charges related to acquisitions completed in that year 
as a result of these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not a good predictor of our future performance 
if our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market securities analysts or investors  our stock price will likely decline 
because a disproportionate amount of our sales occur at the end of a quarter  our operating results are unpredictable 
the timing of our channel partner orders and product shipments can harm our operating results 
our quarterly revenues and operating results depend upon the volume and timing of channel partner orders received during a given quarter and the percentage of each order that we are able to ship and recognize as revenue during each quarter  each of which is extremely difficult to forecast 
moreover  the majority of our orders in a given quarter historically have been shipped in the last month of that quarter and sometimes in the last few weeks of the quarter 
this trend is likely to continue  and any failure or delay in the closing of orders during the last part of a quarter would materially harm our operating results  as occurred in the second and third quarter of furthermore  due to this trend  we may be unable to ship products in the period we receive the order  which would have an adverse impact on our operating results 
in such events  the price of our common stock would decline 
difficulty in estimating channel partner orders can harm our operating results 
we typically ship products within a short time after we receive an order and historically have had no material backlog 
therefore  backlog is not a good indicator of future net revenues 
as a result  net revenues for any particular quarter are extremely difficult to predict 
additionally  orders from our channel partners are based on the level of demand from end users 
the uncertainty of end user demand means that any quarter could be significantly negatively impacted by lower end user orders which could in turn negatively affect orders we receive from our channel partners 
accordingly  our expectations for both short and long term future net revenues are based almost exclusively on our own estimate of future demand and not on firm channel partner orders 
our expense levels are based largely on these estimates 
because we receive a majority of our channel partner orders in the last month of a quarter and often in the last few weeks of the quarter  we are limited in our ability to reduce expenses quickly if for any reason orders and net revenues do not meet our expectations in a particular period 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in demand for our products in relation to our expectations would have an adverse impact on our operating results 
general economic conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our business 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly exposed to adverse changes in general economic conditions which can result in reductions in capital expenditures by end user customers for our products  longer sales cycles  deferral or delay of purchase commitments for our products and increased competition 
these factors adversely impacted our operating results in  where we experienced a sequential revenue decrease in each of the first three quarters 
we also experienced a sequential revenue decreases in the second  third and fourth quarters of due in part to these factors 
all of is subject to similar risks  particularly if the current economic downturn and uncertainty in technology spending continues 
in addition  we also face the risk that some of our channel partners have inventory levels in excess of future anticipated sales growth 
if such sales growth does not occur in the time frame anticipated by these channel partners for any reason  including the continuation of the current economic downturn and uncertainty in technology spending throughout  these channel partners may substantially decrease the amount of product they order from us in subsequent periods  or product returns may exceed historical or predicted levels which would harm our business 
for example  our channel partners reduced their inventory levels during in anticipation of lower end user demand 
also  in  we began to implement a new direct touch strategy in concert with a realignment of our channel partner strategy 
as part of this new channel partner strategy  the channel inventory model is changing to reduce channel inventories to a more optimal level or to a drop shipment method to certain channel partners end user customers 
during the third quarter and fourth quarter of we believe our channel partners video and voice inventory decreased over the second and third quarter of  respectively 
this decrease was due in part to this shift in channel partner strategy resulting in us shipping fewer video and voice units to channel partners in the third and fourth quarter of the decreased channel inventory levels had less impact on sales of ipower units  which are not typically carried in inventory by our channel partners 
our channel partners are likely to further reduce their inventory levels in based on a continuation of this distribution strategy to move to reduce channel inventory levels 
in addition  any softness in end user demand  which is likely in the current economic environment  could cause our channel partners to reduce their inventory levels even further 
we face risks related to our dependence on channel partners to sell our products 
we are subject to risks associated with our channel partners product inventories and product sell through 
we sell a significant amount of our products to channel partners who maintain their own inventory of our products for sale to dealers and end users 
we often provide special cost or early payment incentives for channel partners to purchase the minimum or more than the minimum quantities contemplated under their agreements with us 
if these channel partners are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventory of our products in a given quarter to dealers and end users or if channel partners decide to decrease their inventories for any reason  such as the current economic downturn and uncertainty in technology industries  the volume of our sales to these channel partners and our net revenues would be negatively affected 
for example  the economic downturn negatively affected our business and operating results in and in if these conditions continue in the future  our business and operating results will continue to be negatively affected 
moreover  if we choose to eliminate or reduce stocking incentive programs  quarterly revenues may fail to meet our expectations or be lower than historical levels 
further  we believe that our plans to reduce our channel inventories to a more optimal level may limit revenue growth and may cause a decrease in revenue in the near term 
in addition  we plan to continue to implement changes to our channel partner strategy which will continue to result in a smaller number of channel partners  a change in the mix of our channel partners and a shift to a model with more direct interaction between us and our direct end user customers 
these changes may continue to cause disruptions in our channels and negatively impact revenue growth in the near term 
our revenue estimates are based largely on end user sales reports that our channel partners provide to us on a monthly basis 
to date  we believe this data has been accurate 
to the extent that this sales out and channel inventory data is inaccurate  we may not be able to make revenue estimates for future periods 
we are subject to risks associated with the success of the businesses of our channel partners 
many of our channel partners that carry multiple polycom products  and from whom we derive significant revenues  are undercapitalized 
the failure of these businesses to establish and sustain profitability or obtain financing could have a significant negative effect on our future revenue levels and profitability and our ability to collect our receivables 
further  the current economic downturn and uncertainty in technology spending in the united states and other regions could cause more of our channel partners businesses to suffer or fail  which would harm our business 
our business would also be harmed if our large channel partners were affected by the current economic downturn and uncertainty in technology spending 
for example  we have experienced a decline in revenues from worldcom and global crossing due to their financial troubles 
this drop in the amount of orders we have received from these two channel partners has negatively affected our revenues and profitability 
to avoid confusion among our channel partners regarding our product offerings  we need to devote significant resources to educating and training them 
when we take any significant actions regarding our product offerings  it is important to educate and train our channel partners to avoid any confusion 
for example  when we began shipping the viewstation fx product  the timing of this delivery date likely created confusion in our channel partner customer base and the end user customer market as these groups waited to see if this new viewstation product was more desirable than the existing products 
therefore  the timing of this new product release likely had a negative effect on our sales in to channel partners and sales out to end users 
we cannot assure you that a similar situation will not happen again 
in the first quarter of we launched new products 
this new product launch could cause confusion amongst our channel partners as we educate and train them on  and as they take time to evaluate  these new product offerings 
in addition  we acquired picturetel corporation  or picturetel  in october  and integrating picturetel s product offerings with ours has created confusion among our channel partners 
we will need to continue to devote significant resources to educate and train our channel partners about our combined product offerings 
ongoing confusion may lead to delays in ordering our products which would negatively affect our revenues 
conflicts with our channel partners could hurt sales of our products 
we have various oem agreements with major telecommunications equipment manufacturers  such as avaya  cisco systems and nortel networks  whereby we manufacture our products to work with the equipment of the oem 
these relationships can create conflicts with our other channel partners who directly compete with our oem partners which could adversely affect revenues from these other channel partners 
because many of our channel partners also sell equipment that competes with our products  these channel partners could devote more attention to these other products which could harm our business 
for example  a significant amount of our network systems revenues in were generated from sales to tandberg  sony and vcon  which compete with us in the video communications product market 
we believe that because of this conflict  they significantly reduced their orders of our network systems products in  which has impacted our sales of this product line 
further  other channel conflicts could arise which cause channel partners to devote resources to other non polycom communications equipment which would negatively affect our business or results of operations 
some of our current and future products are directly competitive with the products of our channel and strategic partners 
for example  we have an agreement with cisco systems under which we ship soundstation ip phones for resale by cisco systems 
during the first quarter of  we introduced a voip end point under the polycom brand that incorporates technology we license from cisco systems 
this product competes directly with the voip products sold by cisco systems 
as a consequence of conflicts such as these  competition with our partners in all of the markets in which we operate is likely to increase  potentially resulting in strains on our existing relationships with these companies 
any such strain could limit the potential contribution of our strategic relationships to our business  restrict our ability to form strategic relationships with these companies in the future and create additional competitive pressures on us  any of which could harm our business 
our channel partner contracts are typically short term and early termination of these contracts may harm our results of operations 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our channel partners  and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our channel partners 
when we do enter into a long term contract  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the channel partner 
in the event of an early termination by or loss of one of our major channel partners  it is unlikely that we will be able to rapidly replace that revenue source which would harm our results of operations 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues 
sales of some of our products have experienced seasonal fluctuations which have affected sequential growth rates for these products  particularly in our third and first quarters 
for example  there was a slowdown in the third quarter of for sales of our products in the european region 
in addition  sales of our video communications products have typically declined in the first quarter of the year compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year 
even though our revenues sequentially increased in the first quarter of from the fourth quarter of  seasonal fluctuations could negatively affect our business which could cause our operating results to fall short of anticipated results for such quarters 
difficulties in integrating our acquisitions could adversely impact our business 
our acquisition of picturetel could adversely impact our business 
we completed the acquisition of picturetel in october the picturetel acquisition is the largest acquisition we have completed  and the complex process of integrating picturetel has required significant resources 
we continue to face ongoing business challenges that include principally the geographic dispersion of our operations and generating market demand for an expanded product line that includes pc based systems and collaboration intensive applications 
in addition  we have incurred significant costs and committed significant management time integrating picturetel s operations  technology  development programs  products  information systems  customers and personnel 
although the integration of picturetel is complete  we will continue to incur cash outflows and additional costs in completing the integration process  such as identifying duplicative or redundant resources and facilities  developing plans for resource consolidation and implementing those plans  fees and expenses of professionals and consultants involved in dissolving legal entities no longer being used  settling existing picturetel liabilities  costs associated with vacating  subleasing and closing facilities and terminating leases  employee severance costs  and upgrading our customer service information systems to accommodate picturetel s larger customer service function 
further  we have a significant liability of approximately million at december  related to vacant and redundant facilities in connection with our acquisition of picturetel which is net of estimated sublease income we expect to generate 
our estimate of sublease income is based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets 
if actual sublease income is lower than our estimates for any reason  if it takes us longer than we estimated to sublease these facilities  or if the associated cost of subleasing or terminating our lease obligations for these facilities is greater than we estimated  we would incur additional charges to operations which would harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
for example  the company has an approximately  square foot building which is fully subleased to a third party for which the sublease runs concurrent with the company s lease obligation 
if this tenant is unable to fulfill  for any reason  their contractual obligations under the sublease  we would incur additional charges to operations which would harm our business 
in addition  until our vacated and redundant facilities are subleased or the lease obligations for these facilities are terminated  we will continue to pay the contractual lease and facility operating expense obligations without any sublease income to offset these costs 
further  in the event that we agree to sublease a facility or terminate a lease obligation through a lease buyout or other means  we may incur a material cash outflow up to and potentially exceeding our recorded liability at the time of such transaction  which would harm our operating cash flows 
to the extent that any such cash outflows or additional costs exceed the amount of our recorded liability related to the sublease or termination of these lease obligations  we could incur a charge to operations which would harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations 
difficulties in integrating past or future acquisitions could adversely affect our business 
we have spent and will continue to spend significant resources identifying and acquiring businesses 
the efficient and effective integration of our acquired businesses into our organization is critical to our growth 
in addition to picturetel  we acquired the following businesses in our prior fiscal year accord networks ltd  or accord  in february  circa communications  ltd  or circa  in april and atlanta signal processors  incorporated  or aspi  in november further  we acquired meetu 
com  inc  or meetu  in june these and any future acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of these and any future acquisitions or to successfully integrate the operations of the companies we acquire could also harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will not incur material charges in future quarters to reflect additional costs associated with past acquisitions or any future acquisitions we may make 
difficulties we may encounter managing a substantially larger business could adversely affect our operating results 
we experienced significant growth in our business and operations due to internal expansion and business acquisitions during the last five years  and if we do not appropriately manage this growth and any future growth  our operating results will be negatively affected 
our business has grown in recent years through both internal expansion and business acquisitions  and continued growth may cause a significant strain on our infrastructure  internal systems and managerial resources 
for example  our annual revenues increased from million in to million in  and during the past eight fiscal quarters  we acquired accord  circa  picturetel  aspi and meetu 
further  our headcount increased from employees at december  to employees at december  and to  employees at december  to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to improve and expand our infrastructure  including operating and administrative systems and controls  and continue managing headcount  capital and processes in an efficient manner 
our productivity and the quality of our products may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively and coordinate among our executive  engineering  finance  marketing  sales  operations and customer support organizations  all of which add to the complexity of our organization and increase our operating expenses 
in addition  our revenues may not grow at a sufficient rate to absorb the costs associated with a larger overall headcount 
in addition  because of our acquisition of picturetel  our video communications product development group is now located in multiple locations  and we have limited experience coordinating a large  geographically separated product development group 
our future growth may require significant additional resources 
we cannot assure you that resources will be available when we need them or that we will have sufficient capital to fund these potential resource needs 
also  as we assess our resources following our acquisitions  we will likely determine that redundancy in certain areas will require consolidation of these resources 
any organizational disruptions associated with the consolidation process could require further management attention and financial expenditures 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  if we experience a shortfall in resources or if we must take additional restructuring charges  our results of operations will be harmed 
some of our officers and key personnel have worked together for only a short period of time or have only recently joined us 
some of our officers and key personnel have worked together for only a short period of time 
for example  our senior vice president  worldwide sales and our senior vice president and general manager  video communications joined us within the past three months 
in addition  some of our executive officers have recently assumed significant new responsibilities  and they may require some time to transition into these new roles 
if we fail to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel  our business will be harmed 
our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire  assimilate and retain qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel 
the loss of any key employee  the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees  particularly technical and management  as needed  could harm our business 
in addition  many of our key employees in israel  who are responsible for development of our network systems products  are obligated to perform annual military reserve duty and may be called to active duty at any time under emergency conditions 
the loss of the services of any executive officer or other key technical or management personnel could harm our business 
if we fail to compete successfully  our business and results of operations would be significantly harmed 
we face significant competition in the communications industry which is subject to rapid technological change 
in video communications  our major competitors include tandberg and a number of other companies including aethra  clearone  huawei  nec  panasonic  philips  sony  vcon and vtel  as well as various smaller or new industry entrants 
some of these companies have substantial financial resources and production  marketing  engineering and other capabilities with which to develop  manufacture  market and sell their products 
in addition  with advances in telecommunications standards  connectivity and video processing technology and the increasing market acceptance of video communications  other established or new companies may develop or market products competitive with our video communications products 
we believe we will face increasing competition from alternative video communications solutions that employ new technologies or new combinations of technologies from companies such as com  cisco systems  hewlett packard  dell  microsoft  nortel networks  realnetworks and webex  that enable web based or network based video and collaboration communications 
the market for voice communications equipment  including voice conferencing and desktop equipment  is highly competitive and also subject to rapid technological change  regulatory developments and emerging industry standards 
we expect competition to persist and increase in the future in this area 
in voice communications  our major competitors include aethra  cisco systems  clearone communications  konftel  mitel  soundgear and other companies that have in the past offered lower cost  full duplex speakerphones 
in the voip desktop space  there are several low cost manufacturers in asia and europe that are emerging 
in addition  there are notable pbx and ip call manager manufacturers that compete on the standards based ip space including cisco  mitel and siemens 
furthermore  all major telephony manufacturers produce hands free speakerphone units that are lower cost than our voice communications products 
our network systems business has significant competition from radvision  and a number of other companies  including avaya  cisco systems  first virtual and tandberg 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved performance characteristics 
new product introductions by our competitors could cause a significant decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing products and future products 
we believe that the possible effects from ongoing competition may be the reduction in the prices of our products and our competitors products or the introduction of additional lower priced competitive products 
we expect this increased competitive pressure may lead to intensified price based competition  resulting in lower prices and gross margins which would significantly harm our results of operations 
we face risks related to our international operations and sales 
because of our significant operations in israel  we are subject to risks associated with the military  political and regulatory environment in israel and the middle east region 
the principal research and development and manufacturing facilities of our network systems group and many of that group s suppliers are located in israel 
additionally  our acquisition of meetu further concentrates our research and development activities for our network systems product line in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel and the middle east region directly affect our network systems group s operations 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its geographic neighbors 
current and future armed conflicts or political instability in the region may impair our ability to produce and sell our network systems products and could disrupt research or developmental activities 
a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
the future of peace efforts between israel and its geographic neighbors remains uncertain and there has been a marked increase in civil unrest and hostility and military action between israelis and palestinians 
this hostility could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
further  a war with iraq or other countries in the region perceived as a threat by the united states government could result in additional unrest or cause israel to be attacked which would adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business 
the technology used to develop our current network systems products was developed in part with grants from the israeli office of the chief scientist 
under israeli law  technology developed pursuant to grants from the office of the chief scientist cannot be transferred to any person without the prior written consent of the office of the chief scientist 
the grants also contain restrictions on the ability to manufacture products developed with these grants outside of israel 
approval to manufacture such products outside of israel  if granted  is generally subject to an increase in the total amount to be repaid to the office of the chief scientist of between to of the amount granted  depending on the extent of the manufacturing to be conducted outside of israel 
these restrictions on the ability to transfer certain of our technology to third parties or manufacture products outside israel may adversely affect our operating results and the development of additional network systems products and significantly reduce the value of the technology 
international sales represent an increasing portion of our net revenues and risks inherent in international sales could harm our business 
international sales represent an increasing portion of our net revenues  and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
international sales are subject to certain inherent risks  including the following adverse economic conditions in international markets  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  adverse economic impact of terrorist attacks and incidents and any military response to those attacks  or the outbreak of war or other hostilities  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  potentially adverse tax consequences  and potential foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
international net revenues may fluctuate as a percentage of total net revenues in the future as we introduce new products 
these fluctuations are primarily the result of our practice of introducing new products in north america first and the additional time required for product homologation and regulatory approvals of new products in international markets 
to the extent we are unable to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner  our business could be harmed 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
although  to date  a substantial majority of our international sales has been denominated in us currency  we expect that a growing number of sales could be denominated in non us currencies as more international customers request billing in their currency 
as a result  we expect our business will be significantly more vulnerable to currency fluctuations which could adversely impact our results of operations 
while we do not hedge for speculative purposes  as a result of our increased exposure to currency fluctuations  we from time to time engage in currency hedging activities solely to mitigate temporary currency fluctuation exposure 
however  we have limited experience with these hedging activities  and they may not be successful which could harm our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  significant adverse changes in currency exchange rates  as happened in the european market in and in the asian market in late  could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in revenue or profitability in that country 
we have limited supply sources for some key components of our products  and our operations could be harmed by supply interruptions  component defects or unavailability of these components 
some key components used in our products are currently available from only one source and others are available from only a limited number of sources  including some key integrated circuits and optical elements 
we also obtain certain plastic housings  metal castings and other components from suppliers located in china and other asian countries  and any political or economic instability in that region in the future  or future import restrictions  may cause delays or an inability to obtain these supplies 
further  we have suppliers in israel and a war with iraq or other middle eastern countries perceived as a threat by the united states government may cause delays or an inability to obtain supplies for our network systems products 
we have no raw material supply commitments from our suppliers and generally purchase components on a purchase order basis either directly or through our contract manufacturers 
we have had limited experience purchasing supplies of various components for our products  and some of the components included in our products  such as microprocessors and other integrated circuits  have from time to time been subject to limited allocations by suppliers 
in addition  companies with limited or uncertain financial resources manufacture some of these components 
in the event that we  or our contract manufacturers  are unable to obtain sufficient supplies of components  develop alternative sources as needed  or companies with limited financial resources go out of business  our operating results could be seriously harmed 
moreover  our operating results would be seriously harmed by receipt of a significant number of defective components  an increase in component prices or our inability to obtain lower component prices in response to competitive price reductions 
additionally  our video communications products are designed based on integrated circuits produced by philips semiconductor  or philips  and cameras produced by sony 
if we could no longer obtain integrated circuits or cameras from these suppliers  we would incur substantial expense and take substantial time in redesigning our products to be compatible with components from other manufacturers  and we cannot assure you that we would be successful in obtaining these components from alternative sources in a timely or cost effective manner 
additionally  both sony and philips compete with us in the video communications industry which may adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary components 
the failure to obtain adequate supplies of vital components could prevent or delay product shipments which could harm our business 
we also rely on the introduction schedules of some key components in the development or launch of new products 
any delays in the availability of these key components could harm our business 
manufacturing disruption or capacity constraints would harm our business 
we subcontract the manufacture of our voice and video product lines to celestica  a third party contract manufacturer 
we use celestica s thailand facilities  and should there be any disruption in services due to natural disaster or economic or political difficulties in thailand or asia or any other reason  such disruption would harm our business and results of operations 
also  celestica s thailand facility is currently the sole source manufacturer of these products  and if celestica experiences an interruption in operations or otherwise suffers from capacity constraints  we would experience a delay in shipping these products which would have an immediate negative impact on our revenues 
as a result  we may not be able to meet any demand for our products which could negatively affect revenues in the quarter of the disruption and harm our reputation 
in addition  operating in the international environment exposes us to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and potentially adverse tax consequences  all of which could harm our business and results of operations 
further  our network systems products are manufactured in israel which is currently experiencing internal and external conflicts that include terrorist acts and military action 
also  a war with iraq or other middle eastern countries perceived as a threat by the united states government could cause us to experience a manufacturing disruption due to acts associated with these conflicts which could harm our business 
in addition  certain technology used in our network systems products was developed through grants from the office of the chief scientist in israel 
under israeli law  it is prohibited to transfer technology developed pursuant to these grants to any person without the prior written consent of the office of the chief scientist 
the grants also contain restrictions on the ability to manufacture products developed with these grants outside of israel 
approval to manufacture such products outside of israel  if granted  is generally subject to an increase in the total amount to be repaid to the office of the chief scientist of between to of the amount granted  depending on the extent of the manufacturing to be conducted outside of israel 
these restrictions on the ability to transfer technology to third parties or manufacture products outside israel may adversely affect our operating results and significantly reduce the value of the technology developed under these grants 
we face risks associated with our products and product development 
we may experience delays in product introductions and our products may contain defects which could adversely affect market acceptance for these products and our reputation and seriously harm our results of operations 
from through  our revenue was due in large part to sales of new video communications products 
although we intend to continue to introduce new video and voice products  such as our visual concert products  soundsation vtx  viewstation ec  viewstation ex  mgc  vortex ef  pathnavigator and weboffice products  we cannot assure you that new product releases will be timely or that they will be made at all 
for example  the viewstation fx and viavideo were delayed from their original release dates which we believe negatively affected our net revenues in additionally  any new or existing product introductions may contain defects and may not produce the revenue growth we experienced from through with our acquisition of picturetel  our video communications product development group is now located in massachusetts and texas 
since we do not have significant experience coordinating a large geographically separated product development group  we may experience product delays in the future  due to communications  logistics or other issues 
similarly  our acquisition of aspi may contribute to voice communications product delays  as our voice communications product development group is now dispersed among california  georgia and canada 
in the past  we have experienced other delays in the introduction of certain new products and enhancements  and we believe that such delays may occur in the future 
for instance  we experienced delays in introducing the viewstation mp and webstation from their original expected release dates due to unforeseen technology and manufacturing ramping issues 
similar delays occurred during the introduction of the showstation  showstation ip and soundstation premier which affected the first customer ship dates of these products 
we also had delays in introducing our soundstation ip product which we believe negatively impacted our sales revenue in the first quarter of further  our soundpoint ip product introduction was delayed which we believe negatively impacted our sales in the third and fourth quarters of any similar delays in the future for other new product offerings currently under development could adversely affect market acceptance for these products and our reputation  and seriously harm our results of operations 
we face risks related to the adoption rate of new technologies 
we have invested significant resources developing products that are dependent on the adoption rate of new technologies 
for example  our soundstation ip and soundpoint ip products are dependent on the roll out of voice over ip  or voip  technologies 
the success of our viavideo product depends on the increased use of desktop video collaboration technologies 
the success of our weboffice product is dependent on the increased use and acceptance of web collaboration technologies in concert with audio and video conferencing 
if the use of new technologies that our current and future products are based on does not occur  or occurs more slowly than expected  we may not be able to sell certain of our products in significant volumes and our business may be harmed 
lower than expected market acceptance of our products  price competition and other price decreases would negatively impact our business 
if the market does not accept our products  including the new products launched in the first quarter of  our profitability could be harmed 
our profitability could also be negatively affected in the future as a result of continuing competitive price pressures in the sale of video and voice conferencing equipment and network systems which could cause us to reduce the prices for any of these products 
further  we have reduced prices in the past in order to expand the market for our products  and in the future  we may further reduce prices or introduce new products that carry lower margins in order to expand the market or stimulate demand for our products 
while we cannot assure you that these actions would have the desired result  any of these actions could have an adverse impact on our product margins and profitability 
our success depends on our ability to assimilate new technologies in our products and to properly train our channel partners in the use of those products 
the markets for video and voice communications products and network systems products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the success of our new products depends on several factors  including proper new product definition  product cost  timely completion and introduction of new products  differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 
additionally  properly addressing the complexities associated with compatibility issues  channel partner training  technical and sales support as well as field support are also factors that may affect our success in this market 
further  the shift in communications from circuit switched to ip based technologies over time may require us to add new channel partners and gain new core technological competencies 
we are attempting to address these needs and the need to develop new products through our internal development efforts  joint developments with other companies and through acquisitions 
we may not identify successful new product opportunities and develop and bring products to market in a timely manner 
additionally  we cannot assure you that competing technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
the failure of our new product development efforts and any inability to service or maintain the necessary third party interoperability licenses would harm our business and results of operations 
product obsolescence  excess inventory and other asset impairment can negatively affect our results of operations 
we operate in a high technology industry which is subject to rapid and frequent technology and market demand changes 
these changes can often render existing technologies obsolete 
these obsolescence issues can require write downs in inventory value when it is determined that the recorded value of existing inventory is greater than its fair market value 
for example  this situation occurred in  and again in the first six months of  when we recorded material excess and obsolescence charges associated with our inventory of network access products 
this situation also occurred during the first quarter of for the showstation ip 
also  our viewstation product and ipower products offer certain comparable functionality and may compete with each other for customers 
in addition  we launched several new products in the first quarter of if sales of one of these products have a negative effect on sales of the other product  it could significantly increase the inventory levels of the negatively impacted product 
the potential for new products to render existing products obsolete  cause inventories of existing products to increase or reduce the demand for existing products exists for every one of our products 
we purchased several businesses in and which included goodwill valued at approximately million and other purchased intangible assets valued at approximately million as of december  this represents a significant portion of our recorded assets 
generally accepted accounting principles related to goodwill and other intangibles changed with the issuance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets which we adopted effective january  under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but must be reviewed for impairment at least annually or sooner under certain circumstances 
other intangible assets that are deemed to have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives  but must be reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist  or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  we cannot assure you that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill impairment tests 
if impairment is deemed to exist  we would write down the recorded value of these intangible assets to their fair values which could result in a full write off of their book value 
if these write downs do occur  they could harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  we have made investments in private companies which we classify as other assets in our balance sheet 
the value of these investments is influenced by many factors  including the operating effectiveness of these companies  the overall health of these companies industries  the strength of the private equity markets and general market conditions 
due to these and other factors  we have recorded charges against earnings totaling million from fiscal through associated with the impairment of these investments  which has been reflected in loss on strategic investments in the statements of operations 
these investments have been fully written off as of december  we may make additional investments in private companies which would be subject to similar impairment risks  and which may cause us to write down the recorded value of any such investments 
further  we cannot assure you that future inventory  investment  license  fixed asset or other asset write downs will not happen 
if future write downs do occur  they could harm our business and results of operations 
failure to adequately service and support our products could harm our results of operations 
our recent growth has been due in large part to an expansion into products with more complex technologies  including our network systems products and our ipower products 
this has increased the need for product warranty and service capabilities 
if we cannot develop and train our internal support organization or maintain our relationship with our outside technical support  it could harm our business 
if we have insufficient proprietary rights or if we fail to protect those rights we have  our business would be materially impaired 
we rely on third party license agreements and termination or impairment of these agreements may cause delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments which would harm our business 
we have licensing agreements with various suppliers for software incorporated into our products 
for example  we license video communications source code from adtran  ebsnet  mitsubishi  omnitel  radvision and telesoft  video algorithm protocols from ezenia and real networks  development source code from cisco systems and philips semiconductor  audio algorithms from lucent technologies  nortel networks and texas instruments  communication software from databeam and windows software from microsoft 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the termination or impairment of these licenses could result in delays or reductions in new product introductions or current product shipments until equivalent software could be developed  licensed and integrated  if at all possible which would harm our business and results of operations 
we rely on patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights which may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our proprietary rights 
others may independently develop similar proprietary information and techniques or gain access to our intellectual property rights or disclose such technology 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any patent or registered trademark owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged in the us or foreign countries or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
furthermore  others may develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our patents 
in addition  foreign intellectual property laws may not protect our intellectual property rights 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity of and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could harm our business  and could ultimately be unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property rights 
we face and might in the future face intellectual property infringement claims that might be costly to resolve 
we have from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights covering our products 
for example  on september   a suit captioned collaboration properties  inc v 
polycom  inc 
was filed in the united states court in the northern district of california 
the complaint alleges that our viewstation  viavideo  ipower  weboffice and path navigator products infringe us patents owned by plaintiff 
the complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and exemplary damages for past and present infringement and to permanently enjoin us from infringing on the patents in the future  on november  we filed an answer asserting  among other things  no infringement and that plaintiff s patents are invalid and unenforceable 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses and counterclaims  and intend to vigorously defend this action 
however  litigation involves significant inherent risks and uncertainties  and if an adverse outcome was to occur it could significantly harm our business 
in addition  our industry is characterized by uncertain and conflicting intellectual property claims and vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions which have resulted in significant and protracted and expensive litigation 
in the past  we have been involved in such litigation which adversely affected our operating results 
for example  in november  videoserver  inc  now known as ezenia inc  filed a patent infringement claim against accord s us subsidiary  and accord was subsequently added as a defendant 
in september  accord and its us subsidiary entered into a settlement agreement with ezenia under which the case was dismissed and accord paid million to ezenia 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any such litigation  that intellectual property claims will not be made against us in the future or that we will not be prohibited from using the technologies subject to any such claims or be required to obtain licenses and make corresponding royalty payments 
in addition  the necessary management attention to  and legal costs associated with  litigation can have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
business interruptions could adversely affect our operations 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  national catastrophe  such as the terrorist attacks which occurred on september   an attack on israel and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a fully implemented detailed disaster recovery plan 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur  and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our cash flow could fluctuate due to the potential difficulty of collecting our receivables 
over the past few years  we initiated significant investments in europe and asia to expand our business in these regions 
in europe and asia  as with other international regions  credit terms are typically longer than in the united states 
therefore  as europe  asia and other international regions grow as a percentage of our net revenues  as happened from through  accounts receivable balances will likely increase as compared to previous years 
additionally  sales in the network systems and video communications industries typically have longer payment periods as compared to the voice communications market 
therefore  if network systems and video products constitute a greater percentage of net revenues  accounts receivable balances will likely increase 
these increases would cause our days sales outstanding to increase as compared to prior years and will negatively affect future cash flows 
although we have been able to largely offset the effects of these influences through additional incentives offered to channel partners at the end of each quarter in the form of prepaid discounts  these additional incentives have lowered our profitability and  given the continued downturn in the united states economy and uncertainty in technology spending  many companies are opting to not take advantage of our incentives and instead preserve their liquidity 
in addition  the continued economic downturn in the united states may restrict the availability of capital which may delay our collections from our channel partners beyond our historical experience or may cause companies to file for bankruptcy  which occurred with global crossing and worldcom 
either of these conditions would harm our cash flow and days sales outstanding performance 
although in recent quarters our experience in collecting receivables has been good and we expect this trend to continue  there can be assurance that it will continue 
our stock price fluctuates as a result of the conduct of our business and stock market fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by a variety of factors  including statements or changes in opinions  ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the market in which we do business  including competitors  partners  suppliers or telecommunications industry leaders or relating to us specifically  as has occurred recently  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  technological innovations by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our results of operations  general market conditions or market conditions specific to technology industries  and domestic and international macroeconomic factors 
in addition  the stock market continues to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices for many high technology companies like us 
these fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and bank borrowings 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio which only includes highly liquid  high quality instruments  with the exception of the million invested in equity securities of publicly traded companies 
we may occasionally use forward contracts as a hedge against currency exchange rate fluctuations which may affect the value of trade receivables billed in currencies other than the united states dollar 
as of december   we have no open foreign currency hedging contracts 
the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates the principal amounts reflected above based on the short maturities of these financial instruments 
short term and long term investments consist of us  state and municipal government obligations and foreign and domestic public corporate debt and equity securities  of which a total of million was strategically invested in certain equity securities of publicly traded companies at december  these investments are subject to market price fluctuations which are primarily influenced by changes in interest rates and credit quality and are marked to market each period by recording an unrealized gain or loss in stockholders equity  except for our warrants to purchase publicly traded equity securities which are marked to market through the consolidated statement of operations 
if we sell our short term or long term investments prior to their maturity  we may incur a charge to operations in the period the sale took place 
for  we realized million in losses related to the sale or write down of our strategic investments in certain equity securities of publicly traded companies  which is reflected in loss on strategic investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
the following tables present the hypothetical changes in fair values in the securities  excluding cash and cash equivalents and investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies  held at december  that are sensitive to the changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps and bps over six and twelve month time horizons 
the following table estimates the fair value of the portfolio at a twelve month time horizon in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points issuer current fair market value bps bps bps bps us government securities     state and local governments     corporate debt securities     total      the following table estimates the fair value of the portfolio at a six month time horizon in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points issuer current fair market value bps bps bps bps us government securities     state and local governments     corporate debt securities     total      a substantial majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
only a minor amount of foreign invoices are paid in currencies other than the us dollar and these invoices are funded at the time of payment 
however  in connection with the acquisition of picturetel  we are selling ipower products and related services in some local currencies  primarily euros  british pounds  hong kong dollars  singapore dollars and japanese yen  which have increased our foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk
