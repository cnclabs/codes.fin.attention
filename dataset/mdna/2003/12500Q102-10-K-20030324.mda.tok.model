financial condition maturity structure of assets and liabilities and sensitivity to changes in interest rates securities available for sale the company invests its excess funds in a variety of investment structures  including collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and other asset backed securities  usually with short effective durations 
all securities purchased are investment grade  nonetheless there exists the possibility of loss from time to time resulting from changes in credit risk  as these securities are collateralized with loans made by others  and from substantial changes in interest rate environments during volatile economic periods 
the following tables reflect the company s available for sale securities at december   by fixed and floating rates 
other securities are primarily comprised of collateralized mortgage obligations and asset backed securities as outlined in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
fixed rate securities us government state and other agencies municipal securities weighted weighted weighted amortized average amortized average amortized average cost yield cost yield cost yield dollars in thousands term to maturity one year or less    over one year through five years    over five years  totals    included in fixed rate debt securities are  of cmos  mortgage backed securities  and other debt securities 
these have been distributed based on estimates of their principal cash flows rather than their contractual final maturities 
the balance  largely fixed rate municipal securities  are distributed on the basis of contractual maturity 
floating rate securities us government state and other agencies municipal securities weighted weighted weighted amortized average amortized average amortized average cost yield cost yield cost yield dollars in thousands term to repricing maturity one year or less   over one year through five years over five years totals   at december   gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses on securities available for sale amounted to million and million  respectively 
financial condition the company s investment securities are subject to market risk in the following ways 
of the investment securities owned as of december    are floating rate instruments tied to various indices  primarily libor 
lesser amounts are tied to treasury rates and other indices 
the majority of these floating rate instruments are subject to interest rate caps that range from to 
if interest rates rise enough so that there is a significant possibility that a given security will become subject to its interest rate cap  the market value of that security will be reduced 
this risk is greater to the extent that the remaining life of the investment is longer 
the company s floating rate investments have an average life of about two years 
market risk may also result from the fact that various indices will not always move by the same amount when interest rates increase 
this may cause securities tied to one index to perform less well than securities tied to other indices 
most of the remaining  of securities are fixed rate cmos  mortgage backed securities and other debt securities 
fixed rate investments have market risk because their rate of return does not change at all with the general level of interest rates 
because homeowners are less likely to refinance their mortgages at higher rates  an additional characteristic of cmos and mortgage backed securities is that their principal payments tend to slow when interest rates rise 
if the fixed rate earned on the investment is lower than the new market rate  this can result in a decline in the value of these securities 
almost all of the company s fixed rate cmos have very short average lives and have interest rates above current market levels  which reduces the market risk of these securities 
the average life of the company s fixed rate investments is less than two years 
loans the following tables reflect maturity repricing information for commercial  construction and other loans 
in both the fixed and floating rate loan tables  the category of other loans is primarily comprised of mortgage loans on real estate  including residential  commercial and equity lines of credit  as outlined in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
fixed rate loans commercial construction other loans loans loans in thousands term to maturity one year or less    over one year through five years    over five years   totals    included in fixed rate loans maturing in one year or less are  of customer account overdrafts 
floating rate loans commercial construction other loans loans loans in thousands term to repricing maturity one year or less    over one year through five years   over five years   totals    most residential mortgage loans are adjustable rate mortgages subject to interest rate caps 
financial condition deposits the remaining maturity of time certificates of deposit as of december  was as follows fixed rate certificates of deposit more than  or  less in thousands remaining maturity three months or less   over three months through six months   over six months through months   over one year through five years   over five years totals   other deposits may be withdrawn by the customer without notice or penalty 
the rates paid thereon are reviewed each month and changed at the company s option as often as indicated by changing market conditions 
generally  the company s strategy is to price deposits in relation to rates available in the open market  including other financial institutions  and its liquidity needs based on factors that include loan demand 
interest rates paid are frequently reviewed and are modified to reflect changing conditions 
borrowings the remaining maturity of borrowings from the federal home loan bank as of december  was as follows fixed rate fhlb borrowings in thousands remaining maturity three months or less  over three months through six months  over six months through months  over one year through five years  over five years  totals  rates paid on other short term borrowings change daily 
financial condition loans the following is a summary of loans outstanding as of the dates indicated december  in thousands commercial loans      construction mortgage loans      commercial mortgage loans      industrial revenue bonds     residential mortgage loans      consumer loans      total loans      allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the amount necessary to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance consists of specific  general and unallocated components 
commercial real estate and commercial business loans are evaluated individually for allowance purposes 
other categories of loans are generally evaluated as a group 
the specific component relates to loans that are classified as doubtful  substandard or special mention 
loans classified as doubtful are considered impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 and an allowance is determined using a discounted cash flow calculation 
loss factors for substandard loans are based on a loss migration database  while loss factors for all other categories of loans are based on the company s historical loss experience with similar loans of similar quality as determined by the company s internal rating system 
loss factors are then adjusted for additional points that consider qualitative factors such as current economic trends both local and national  concentrations  growth and performance trends  and the results of risk management assessments 
accordingly  increases or decreases in the amount of each loan category as well as the ratings of the loans within each category are considered in calculating the overall allowance 
the allowance is an estimate  and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates 
as adjustments become necessary  they are reported in earnings of the periods in which they become known 
in addition  the company s allowance for loan losses is periodically reviewed by the occ as part of their examination process 
the occ may require the company to make additions to the allowance based upon judgments different from those of management 
non performing assets and loan loss experience non performing assets as of december were as follows in thousands nonaccrual loans      loans past due days or more and still accruing property from defaulted loans     total non performing assets      restructured troubled debt performing in accordance with amended terms  not included above financial condition accrual of interest income on loans is discontinued when it is questionable whether the borrower will be able to pay principal and interest in full and or when loan payments are days past due unless the loan is fully secured by real estate or other collateral and in the process of collection 
loans are classified substandard when they are not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the debtor or of the collateral 
at december    of loans were included in this category  in addition to loans reported above 
the company s loan classification system also includes a category for loans that are monitored for possible deterioration in credit quality 
at december    of loans were included in this category 
in addition  it is possible that there may be losses on other loans that have not been specifically identified 
the changes in the allowance for loan losses and related charge off recovery ratios for the years ended december were as follows dollars in thousands balance  beginning of year      provision for loan losses charge offs commercial loans construction mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans industrial revenue bonds residential mortgage loans consumer loans total charge offs recoveries on loans previously charged off commercial loans construction mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans industrial revenue bonds residential mortgage loans consumer loans total recoveries  balance  end of year      ratio of net charge offs recoveries to average loans outstanding financial condition the allowance for loan losses  as of december  was allocated as follows in thousands commercial loans      construction mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans      industrial revenue bonds residential mortgage loans      consumer loans  recoveries on loans previously charged off exceeded charge offs therefore management determined that additions to the allowance for loan losses were unnecessary in the allowance represented of total loans at december   of total loans at december   and of total loans at december  although management believes that upon review of loan quality and payment statistics  the allowance is adequate to cover losses likely to result from loans in the current portfolio at december   there can be no assurance that the allowance is adequate or that additional provisions might not become necessary 
liquidity the company normally experiences changes in its liquidity each year as a result of the seasonal nature of the economy in its market area 
liquidity is usually at its high in late summer and early fall and the annual low point is usually in the spring 
substantially all of the amount shown as cash and due from banks at year end is made up of checks and similar items in the process of collection or was needed to satisfy a requirement to maintain a portion of deposits in an account at the federal reserve 
accordingly  it does not represent a source of liquidity 
in general  investment securities could also be sold if necessary to meet liquidity needs 
in that event  a gain or loss would be realized if the market value of the securities sold was not equal to their cost  adjusted for the amortization of premium or accretion of discount 
the bank can also borrow funds using investment securities as collateral  and it has a line of credit of  from the federal home loan bank of boston 
the bank has also established a line of credit of  for the purchase of federal funds from suntrust bank and may borrow from the federal reserve bank if necessary 
distribution of assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  average interest rates and interest spread the average amount outstanding for certain categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest income or expense and the average yields earned or rates paid thereon  are summarized in the following table for the three years ended december  nonaccrual loan balances have been included in their respective loan categories  which reduces the calculated yields 
a portion of the income reported in certain of the asset categories is not subject to federal income tax  making it relatively more valuable 
the computed yields shown have not been adjusted for taxable equivalency 
as an indication of the amount of change in the general level of interest rates between years  the average rate on overnight federal funds traded among banks was  and during  and  respectively

earning assets changes in net interest income due to changes in volume and rate the effect on net interest income from changes in interest rates and in the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is summarized in the following table 
these amounts were calculated directly from the amounts included in the preceding table 
the amount allocated to change in volume was calculated by multiplying the change in volume by the average of the interest rates earned or paid in the two periods 
the amount allocated to change in rate was calculated by multiplying the change in rate by the average volume over the two periods 
in  the negative effect of changes in rate more than offset the positive contribution from changes in volume 
rates on earning assets decreased at a faster pace than the company s ability to lower rates on interest bearing liabilities 
the improvement from changes in volume in was a result of the level of average interest bearing liabilities decreased at a more rapid rate than the decrease in average earning assets 
in  declining rates had a negative impact on net interest income 
however  the growth in earning assets exceeded the growth in interest bearing liabilities resulting in an increase in net interest income when compared to compared to compared to change due to increase decrease change due to increase decrease volume rate net volume rate net in thousands earning assets securities mortgage backed securities   cmos      us government agencies state and municipal obligations other securities     total securities      loans commercial    commercial construction   commercial mortgages      industrial revenue bonds residential mortgages      home equity    consumer total loans      total earning assets      interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits now accounts regular savings money market accounts     certificates of deposit of  or more     other time deposits    total interest bearing deposits       borrowings federal home loan bank       other short term borrowings subordinated debt total borrowings       total interest bearing liabilities       net changes due to volume rate       item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices 
in particular  the market prices of interest earning assets may be affected by changes in interest rates 
since net interest income the difference or spread between the interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings is the company s primary source of revenue  interest rate risk is the most significant non credit related market risk to which the company is exposed 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as fluctuations in the level and duration of the company s assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk is the exposure of net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
in addition to directly impacting net interest income  changes in interest rates can also affect the amount of new loan originations  the ability of borrowers to repay variable rate loans  the volume of loan prepayments and refinancings  the carrying value of investment securities classified as available for sale and the flow and mix of deposits 
the company s asset liability management committee  comprised of several directors with senior management  is responsible for managing interest rate risk in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors regarding acceptable levels of interest rate risk  liquidity and capital 
the committee meets monthly and sets the rates paid on deposits  approves loan pricing and reviews investment transactions 
the company s investment portfolio mix consists primarily of collateralized mortgage obligations  including certain interest only securities  and other debt securities  asset backed securities  collateralized with pools of loans and obligations issued by others 
the company s investment policy provides for purchases to be of investment quality and short duration 
the company s loan portfolio is concentrated in residential and commercial real estate loans from southeastern massachusetts 
both the investment and loan portfolio have performed well during the recent reporting period 
however  the probability exists for losses from both investments and loans during periods of significant interest rate and economic volatility 
the company is subject to interest rate risk in the event that rates either increase or decrease 
in the event that interest rates increase  the value of net assets the liquidation value of stockholders equity would decline 
at december   it is estimated that an increase in interest rates of basis points for example  an increase in the prime rate from to would reduce the value of net assets by  on the other hand  if interest rates were to decrease  the value of net assets would increase 
although the value of net assets is subject to risk if interest rates rise but not if rates fall the opposite is generally true of the company s earnings 
if interest rates were to increase  net interest income would increase because the company has more interest earning assets than it has interest bearing liabilities and because much of this excess amount reprices within a short period of time 
as a result  net interest income is instead generally subject to the risk of a decline in rates 
not only are there fewer interest bearing liabilities to reprice  but many of these liabilities could not reprice much lower because the rates paid on them are already low 
during  the company increased its proportion of short term fixed rate investments to total investments to protect yields 
accordingly  if interest rates were to decrease by basis points for example  a decrease in the prime rate from to it is estimated that net interest income would decrease by  on the other hand  if interest rates were to increase  net interest income would increase 
at december   it was estimated that the value of the net assets of the company would decline by  if interest rates were to increase by basis points and that the company s net interest income would decline by  if interest rates were to decline by basis points 
the year to year change in these estimates is a result of a lengthening of the duration of the net assets of the company
