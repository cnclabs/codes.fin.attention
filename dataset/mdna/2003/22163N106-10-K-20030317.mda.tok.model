outlook cott s ongoing focus is to increase sales  market share and profitability for cott and its customers 
the carbonated soft drink industry continues to experience positive growth  especially in the us facing price competition from heavily promoted global and regional brands  cott s major opportunity for growth depends on management s execution of its strategies and on retailers continued commitment to their retailer brand soft drink programs 
in  cott will continue to strive to expand the business through growth with existing customers  the pursuit of new customers and channels and through new acquisitions and alliances 
cott is not able to accurately predict the success or timing of such efforts 
at this point  sales are expected to grow between and for the majority of this growth is expected to be through existing businesses 
along with sales growth from major customers  management also believes there are significant opportunities for growth in the us market as retailer brand penetration is not currently as high as in other markets 
the canadian division will focus on innovation and entry into new channels 
the uk business is stabilizing and continued efforts are expected to further improve earnings performance 
significant growth opportunities exist in mexico as  with a population of approximately million  it is second only to the united states in per capita consumption of soft drinks 
the cemsa plant is currently being upgraded and is expected to go into full operation in time for the summer season

ebitda is defined as earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and unusual items 
although it is not a recognized measure of performance under us or canadian gaap  ebitda is presented because it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service indebtedness 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income  nor to cash provided by operating activities nor any other indicator of performance or liquidity which have been determined in accordance with us or canadian gaap 
cott s method of calculating ebitda may differ from the methods used by other companies and  accordingly  cott s ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
risks and uncertainties risks and uncertainties include national brand pricing strategies  commitment of major customers to retailer brand programs  stability of procurement costs for items such as sweetener  packaging materials and other ingredients  the successful integration of new acquisitions  ability to protect intellectual property and fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies versus the us dollar 
competitive environment in comparison to the major national brand soft drink manufacturers  cott is a relatively small participant in the industry 
the main risk to cott s sales and operating income is the highly competitive environment in which it operates 
cott faces competition from the national brands in all of its markets and from other retailer brand beverage manufacturers in the us and the uk cott s profitability in may be adversely affected to the extent the national brand manufacturers reduce their selling prices or increase the frequency of their promotional activities in cott s core markets or customers do not allocate adequate shelf space for beverages supplied by cott 
reliance on major customers sales to cott s top customer in accounted for top two customers accounted for of the company s total sales and sales to the top ten customers were of total sales 
the loss of a significant customer  or customers which in the aggregate represent a significant portion of cott s sales  could have a material adverse effect on cott s operating results and cash flows 
stability of procurement costs cott is subject to commodity price risk arising from the price movement for certain commodities included as part of raw materials 
cott has a variety of suppliers for many of its materials  and it maintains long standing relationships with many of its suppliers 
replacing key raw material suppliers may increase or decrease raw material costs 
an increase could have a material adverse effect on cott s results of operations 
cott has long term agreements with respect to key raw materials 
the majority of the contracts allow suppliers to alter the costs they charge based on changes in commodity costs  and in some cases other factors  at certain predetermined times and subject to defined guidelines 
as a result  cott bears the risk of shifts in the market costs of these commodities 
cott does not use derivative instruments to manage this risk 
integration of acquired businesses cott has undertaken several acquisitions in the past three years and its business strategy is to continue to expand its business  in part through acquisitions 
to succeed with this strategy  cott must identify appropriate acquisition or strategic alliance candidates and then manage and integrate the acquisitions or alliances with its existing business 
the anticipated efficiencies and other benefits of the acquisitions or alliances may not be realized if cott is unable to successfully integrate the acquired businesses 
protection of intellectual property cott s success depends  in part  on its intellectual property  including the right to manufacture its concentrate formulas 
if it is unable to protect its intellectual property or competitors independently develop similar intellectual property  cott s competitive position could be weakened 
foreign exchange cott is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
operations outside of the us account for approximately of sales and of sales and are concentrated principally in the uk and canada 
cott does not currently use derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
debt obligations and interest rates cott had a net debt to net debt plus equity ratio of as of december  and is subject to the risks associated with this level of debt 
a significant portion of cash flow will be used to make debt service payments and debt levels could limit cott s financial flexibility and ability to obtain favorable financing for future acquisitions 
cott is exposed to changes in interest rates with of its outstanding long term debt is subject to interest at variable rates 
cott regularly reviews the structure of its indebtedness and considers changes to its proportion of floating versus fixed rate debt through refinancing  interest rate swaps or other measures in response to the changing economic environment 
cott does not currently use derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure 
the information below summarizes cott s market risks associated with debt obligations as of december  the table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by year of maturity 
principal payments on the variable rate term loan are the scheduled payments under the agreement and  for  the required annual payment of of the previous year s excess cash flows 
variable rates disclosed represent the actual weighted average rates at december for the year ended december  there fair in millions after total value debt fixed rate weighted average interest rate variable rate weighted average interest rate legal matters cott  along with other industry participants  is currently not in compliance with the environmental protection act ontario and applicable regulations thereunder collectively the epa 
as the requirements under the epa have not been actively enforced since and the non compliance appears to be industry wide  cott believes that the possibility of enforcement is remote and it does not believe that enforcement proceedings  if initiated  would be instituted without a transition period 
as such  cott does not believe that any enforcement would have an immediate material financial impact on its financial results 
cott has not compiled a detailed analysis of the costs of compliance as enforcement of the epa is considered to be remote and will account for any costs of compliance  which may be significant  if incurred
