overview shoe pavilion is the largest independent off price footwear retailer on the west coast that offers a broad selection of women s  men s and children s designer label and name brand merchandise 
the company operated retail stores  including an internet store  in california  washington and oregon under the trade name shoe pavilion  as of december  the company operated retail stores as of december  in july  the company entered into a licensing agreement to operate the shoe departments of gordmans  inc formerly richman gordman price stores  inc department stores located in the midwest 
pursuant to notification from gordmans on december  the license agreement was scheduled to expire effective june  on june   the license agreement with gordmans department stores was terminated due to gordmans default and the company discontinued operating all of the licensed shoe departments in gordmans department stores 
the company operated shoe departments of gordmans  inc at december  the company opened  net of closures  retail stores in  in and in the company closed licensed shoe departments in  including it had opened in  and opened in and in during  the company intends to open approximately to new stores  primarily in california 
the company s growth in net sales historically has resulted primarily from the opening of new stores 
the company expects that the primary source of future sales growth will continue to be new store openings 
because the company s comparable store sales have fluctuated widely  the company does not expect that comparable store sales will contribute significantly to future growth in net sales 
the company defines comparable stores as those stores that have been open for at least consecutive months 
stores open less than consecutive months are treated as new stores  and stores closed during the period are excluded from comparable store sales 
the company s comparable store net sales decreased in  decreased in and increased in net sales will be negatively impacted as the company no longer operates the licensed shoe departments 
net sales generated from the licensed shoe departments were million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
in addition  these stores generated a store operating contribution before overhead  distribution costs  interest and taxes of approximately 
million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
the company does not allocate overhead  distribution costs  interest or taxes to stores 
the majority of the overhead costs  which consist of costs such as merchandising  accounting  information systems  rent and insurance  are shared expenses of the shoe pavilion stores and the licensed shoe departments 
the company seeks to acquire footwear merchandise on favorable financing terms and in quantities large enough to support future growth 
this strategy causes an increase in inventory levels at various times throughout the year 
as a result  similar to other off price retailers  the company s inventory turnover rates are typically less than full price retailers 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require management to make estimates 
table of contents and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the company s financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from the company s estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
management believes that the company s application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  management has found the company s application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements  located elsewhere in this form k 
the company has identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts on its accounts receivable balances for estimated losses projected to result from its debtors inability to make the required payments 
the estimated allowance is based upon specific indentification 
if the financial condition of the debtor was to deteriorate additional allowances may be required 
merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of average cost or market 
the company makes certain assumptions to adjust inventory based on historical experience and current information in order to assess that inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
these assumptions can have a significant impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
fixed assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of fixed assets  the company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related fixed assets and reduces their carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
the company believes at this time that the fixed assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate

sfas supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue no 
sfas requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
the statement also requires certain financial statement disclosures to be included in the notes to the financial statements that include the period in which an exit or disposal activity is initiated and any subsequent period until the related activity is completed 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no

risks associated with expansion the company s continued growth will depend to a significant degree on its ability to expand its operations through the opening of new stores and to operate these stores on a profitable basis 
the success of the company s planned expansion will be significantly dependent upon the company s ability to locate suitable store sites and negotiate acceptable lease terms 
in addition  several other factors could affect the company s ability to expand  including the adequacy of the company s capital resources  the ability to hire  train and integrate employees and the ability to adapt the company s operational systems 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve its planned expansion or that any such expansion will be profitable 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s expansion within its existing markets will not adversely affect the individual financial performance of the company s existing stores or its overall operating results  or that new stores will achieve net sales and profitability levels consistent with existing stores 
to manage its planned expansion  the company regularly evaluates the adequacy of its existing systems and procedures  including product distribution facilities  store management  financial controls and management information systems 
however  there can be no assurance that 
table of contents the company will anticipate all of the changing demands that expanded operations may impose on such systems 
failure to adapt its internal systems or procedures as required could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company actively monitors individual store performance and has closed underperforming stores in the past 
the company intends to continue to close underperforming stores in the future  and if it were to close a number of stores  it could incur significant closure costs and reductions in net sales 
in certain instances  the company may be unable to close an underperforming store on a timely basis because of lease terms 
a significant increase in closure costs or the inability to close one or more underperforming stores on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

during the coming year the company will continue to focus on replacing the gordmans business by seeking to improve comparable store sales results and opening new stores in carefully targeted markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase comparable store sales or open new stores to an extent sufficient to offset the loss of net sales and operating contribution received under the gordmans license agreement 
failure to successfully implement these plans could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
uncertainty of future operating results  fluctuations in comparable store sales although the company has been profitable  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to remain profitable

the deterioration of the company s relationship with any key vendor or vendors could result in delivery delays  merchandise shortages or less favorable terms than the company currently enjoys 
the company deals with its suppliers on an order by order basis and has no long term purchase contracts or other contractual assurances of continued supply or pricing 
as the company s operations expand  its demand for off price inventory will continue to increase 
the company s footwear purchases typically involve manufacturing over runs  over orders  mid or late season deliveries or last season s stock 
the inability of the company to obtain a sufficient supply of readily salable  high margin inventory  to negotiate favorable discount and payment agreements with its suppliers or to sell large inventory purchases without markdowns could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
