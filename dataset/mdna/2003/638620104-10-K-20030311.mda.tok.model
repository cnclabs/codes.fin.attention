item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview to facilitate your review and understanding of this section of our report and the financial statements that follow  we are providing this overview of what management believes are the most important considerations for understanding our company and its business the key factors that drive our business and the principal associated risks 
the company we are a public equity reit that invests in senior housing and long term care properties 
as such passive investments our investments are passive ie  we do not operate the properties  investor flexibility liquidity investors desiring to invest in this real estate sector can do so with an investment flexibility and liquidity that is not available in most direct investments  and no double taxation our income is not taxed at the corporate level as long as we continue to distribute to our shareholders at least of our taxable income and meet other reit tax requirements 
business purpose our long term corporate goal is clearly defined to provide shareholders with an increasing dividend from a safe  secure asset base 
our business model for achieving this goal is equally straightforward 
we invest passively in geographically diversified senior housing and long term care properties primarily  assisted and independent living facilities and skilled nursing facilities 
in making these investments  we generally give equal weighting to facility attributes and operator quality  drawing on our extensive management expertise and experience in this real estate sector 
we continue to focus on this sector because we continue to believe in its growth potential  as evidenced by the favorable demographics of a rapidly growing elderly population and the corresponding recognized need for additional and improved senior housing and long term care alternatives 
operations we primarily make our investments by acquiring an ownership interest in facilities and leasing them to unaffiliated operators under triple net leases that pass all facility operating costs insurance  property taxes  utilities  maintenance  capital improvements  etc 
through to the tenant operator 
in addition  but intentionally to a much lesser extent because we view the risks of this activity to be greater  we from time to time extend mortgage loans to operators 
currently  about or our revenues are derived from our leases  with the remaining coming from our mortgage loans 
last three years after a decade of annual increases  our annual dividend has remained at per share since while that is not necessarily negative given the extensive financial difficulties experienced by operators of assisted and independent living facilities and skilled nursing facilities our core holdings during that period  which forced many of our competitors focused on the same market sectors to reduce or eliminate their dividend  it is still disappointing to us because it falls short of our long term corporate goal 
over the last two years  our funds from operations ffo  which is defined and described in more detail below and  like most reits  is the key measurement tool that management looks to in running our business decreased almost primarily due to the developments outlined below 
most of this reduction occurred in when the full impact of these developments was realized 
this in turn has increased our ffo dividend payout ie  the percent of our ffo that the dividend represents from in to for although it had improved to for the third and fourth quarter dividends per share 
we generally use the nareit measure of funds from operations 
we define funds from operations as income before extraordinary items adjusted for certain non cash items  primarily real estate depreciation  less gains losses on sales of facilities 
our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other reits 
consequently  our funds from operations may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other reits 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states funds from operations does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and  therefore  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
operator financial problems 
the past three years have been very challenging for many of our tenants as they have had to work through  with varying degrees of success  financial problems largely caused by skilled nursing facility and assisted and independent living facility capital market excesses in the late s and government funding issues 
overly enamored with the sector s long term favorable demographics  a wide range of debt and equity investors flooded this market with large sums of readily available capital that led to excessive levels of operator debt and overbuilding in the late s 
skilled nursing facilities 
we saw unprecedented debt financed merger and acquisition activity with the large  publicly traded skilled nursing facility operators at a time when the federal government was changing the structure and amount of its reimbursement program in a way that did not support the debt incurred 
this led to a number of bankruptcies of these operators including five of the seven largest publicly traded skilled nursing facility operators that depressed this market 
this in turn adversely affected us by reducing our ffo as a result of lost revenues from i negotiated rent reductions  ii lower rentals on re leased facilities acquired through lease terminations in and out of bankruptcy and iii facility closures in a few circumstances  coupled with related bankruptcy and other costs  including substantially increased general and administrative primarily legal expenses 
assisted and independent living facilities 
in our view  investors became irrationally exuberant with the assisted and independent living facility senior housing alternative  especially since unlike skilled nursing facilities  there generally were no requirements to obtain a certificate of need con or other significant governmental barriers for the construction of new facilities 
consequently  the enormous growth in supply rapidly exceeded market demand 
this resulted in newly constructed facilities incurring substantial losses and being unable to pay their rents as they experienced prolonged low occupancy rates 
we were forced either to restructure our leases of these facilities or find new operators  in many cases with rent deferrals or reductions to reflect depressed occupancy levels and market conditions 
our ffo in turn was adversely affected because there were less rental revenues to offset the additional interest expense incurred to finance construction and increased restructuring expenses 
beverly enterprises portfolio restructuring 
in connection with the expiration of the initial term of many of our leases with beverly enterprises  inc beverly  effective january   we restructured our entire leased portfolio of skilled nursing facilities operated by them which accounted for about of our revenues for 
these leases were entered into with beverly in through after we were formed to invest primarily in beverly s facilities 
the leases contained some provisions not found in our leases today  including the ability of beverly to selectively renew the leases by cherry picking the portfolio 
in other words  beverly was able to enter into new leases with us covering the best performing properties and terminate the leases for about under performing properties 
given the generally poorer quality of these properties  we in turn were forced to close some of them and re lease the others for less rent  in several cases to unproven or lower quality operators 
many of these arrangements failed  resulting in further closures and restructurings  and some continue to have problems that may lead to further restructurings although to a much lesser extent 
our ffo has been adversely impacted by the cumulative effect of this beverly restructuring 
capital redeployment from mortgage loan prepayments and purchase option exercises 
we experienced a substantial increase in mortgage loan prepayments and purchase option exercises  especially in and the mortgage prepayments largely resulted from a program we initiated to make our asset base more safe and secure by increasing the relative mix of leased versus mortgaged properties 
unlike leases  in bankruptcy a debtor does not need to determine timely whether to assign  affirm or reject the mortgage in its entirety or to make mortgage payments timely until it makes that determination  but rather can ignore its obligations  challenge the economics of the mortgage and cram down terms including principal amount  interest rate and payment terms to those reflecting typically distressed market levels 
to lower our overall exposure to this scenario  we encouraged prepayments by waiving any prepayment fees 
our ffo was adversely affected by the mortgage loan prepayments and purchase option exercises because we were unable to replace the significant lost revenues from the high yielding leases and loans 
rather  because there were not any desirable new investments available to us at that time in fact  not until  we instead were forced to re deploy the capital to fulfill existing construction commitments for new assisted and independent living facilities that were not yet yielding revenue and otherwise pay down our lower cost debt 
restricted growth 
because of the factors noted above  we have had no net internal growth in revenues from our existing portfolio over the past three years and have seen our ffo decrease 
similarly  we had virtually no external growth in revenues from acquisitions during and in  a number of attractive investment opportunities became available largely as a result of industry wide restructurings 
to supplement our capital sources and take advantage of these opportunities  we formed a joint venture with an institutional investor 
by the end of  we had made a total of about million in new investments  million for our own account and million by our joint venture 
it was primarily the addition of revenues from these acquisitions that enabled us to cover our per share dividend by the end of the third quarter  as noted above 
focus and outlook for our focus for is on maintaining our current dividend and endeavoring to increase our ffo to provide greater dividend coverage 
in that regard  we are cautiously optimistic about our internal growth prospects for we believe that the worst of the restructurings is behind us and  accordingly  that the annual rent increases built into our leases should overcome any reasonably foreseeable further restructurings 
we expect this modest internal growth to be bolstered by rents received from restructured leases and loans that produced little or no revenue for all or most of many of these involve the newly constructed assisted and independent living facilities referred to above that are beginning to see increased occupancies now that further development has substantially moderated 
because maintaining our investment grade rating is of paramount importance to us  we do not desire to increase our debt levels materially until we raise further equity capital 
however  in our view equity capital currently is not available at a reasonable price  so we see little potential for external growth for our own account until that changes 
in management s view  there are two principal near term risks we face in maintaining and then growing our dividend 
the first is more serious operator financial problems leading to more extensive restructurings or tenant disruptions than we currently expect 
this could be unique to a particular operator such as if alterra is unable to emerge from bankruptcy with our leases intact 
on the other hand  it could be more industry wide  such as further federal or state governmental reimbursement reductions in the case of our skilled nursing facilities as governments work through their budget deficits  continuing reduced occupancies or slow lease ups for our assisted and independent living facilities due to general economic and other factors  continuing increases in liability  workers compensation and other insurance premiums and other expenses 
the second principal near term risk is a continued depressed stock price that inhibits our ability to grow externally by taking advantage of what we expect will be the availability of a number of attractive investments in the near term 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that impact our most critical accounting policies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition our rental revenue is accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for leases sfas no 
and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 
among other authoritative pronouncements 
these pronouncements require us to account for the rental income on a straight line basis unless a more appropriate method exists 
we believe that the method most reflective of the use of a healthcare facility is the straight line method 
straight line accounting requires us to calculate the total fixed rent to be paid over the life of the lease and recognize that revenue evenly over that life 
in a situation where a lease calls for fixed rental increases during the life of a lease or there is a period of free rent at the beginning of a lease  rental income recorded in the early years of a lease is higher than the actual cash rent received which creates an asset on the balance sheet called deferred rent receivable 
at some point during the lease  depending on the rent levels and terms  this reverses and the cash rent payments received during the later years of the lease are higher than the rental income recognized  which reduces the deferred rent receivable balance to zero by the end of the lease 
the majority of our leases do not contain fixed increases or provide for free or reduced rent at the beginning of the lease term 
however  certain leases for facilities we have constructed have free rent for the first three to six months and certain leases we have entered into  primarily with regard to facilities returned to us by certain operators discussed below under the caption information regarding certain operators  have reduced or free rent in the early months of the lease or fixed increases in future years 
we record the rent for these facilities on a straight line basis in accordance with sfas no 
however  we also assess the collectibility of the deferred portion of the rent that is to be collected in a future period in accordance with sab no 
this assessment is based on several factors  including the financial strength of the lessee and any guarantors  the historical operations and operating trends of the facility  the historical payment pattern of the facility and whether we intend to continue to lease the facility to the current operator  among others 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates we may not receive the rent payments due in the future  we provide a reserve against the current rental income as an offset to revenue  and depending on the circumstances  we may provide a reserve against the existing deferred rent balance for the portion  up to its full value  that we estimate will not be recovered 
this assessment requires us to determine whether there are factors indicating the future rent payments may not be fully collectible and to estimate the amount of the rent that will not be collected 
if our assumptions or estimates regarding a lease change in the future  we may have to record a reserve to reduce or further reduce the rental revenue recognized and or deferred rent receivable balance 
additional rents are generally computed as a percentage of facility net patient revenues in excess of base amounts or as a percentage of the increase in the consumer price index 
additional rents are generally calculated and payable monthly or quarterly  and most of our leases contain provisions such that total rent cannot decrease from one year to the next 
while the calculations and payments of additional rents contingent upon revenue are generally made on a quarterly basis  sab no 
does not allow for the recognition of such revenue until all possible contingencies have been eliminated 
most of our leases with additional rents contingent upon revenue are structured as quarterly calculations so that all contingencies for revenue recognition have been eliminated at each of our quarterly reporting dates 
depreciation and useful lives of assets we calculate depreciation on our buildings and improvements using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives ranging up to years  generally to years 
a significant portion of the cost of each property is allocated to building generally approximately 
the allocation of the cost between land and building  and the determination of the useful life of a property  are based on management s estimates 
we calculate depreciation and amortization on equipment and lease costs using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of up to five years or the lease term  whichever is appropriate 
we review and adjust useful lives periodically 
if we do not allocate appropriately between land and building or we incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our assets  our computation of depreciation and amortization will not appropriately reflect the usage of the assets over future periods 
asset impairment we review our long lived assets individually on a quarterly basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

indicators may include the tenant s inability to make rent payments  operating losses or negative operating trends at the facility level  notification by the tenant that they will not renew their lease  a decision to dispose of an asset or changes in the market value of the property  among others 
for operating assets  if indicators of impairment exist  we compare the undiscounted cash flows from the expected use of the property to its net book value to determine if impairment exists 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is higher than the current net book value  sfas no 
concludes no impairment exists 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is lower than the current net book value  we recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated fair market value 
to the extent we decide to sell an asset  we recognize an impairment loss if the current net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value less costs to sell 
the above analyses require us to make a determination about whether there are indicators of impairment for individual assets  to estimate the most likely stream of cash flows from operating assets and to determine the fair value of assets that are impaired or held for sale 
if our assumptions  projections or estimates regarding an asset change in the future  we may have to record an impairment charge to reduce or further reduce the net book value of such asset 
collectibility of receivables we evaluate the collectibility of our mortgage and other receivables on a regular basis 
we evaluate the collectibility of the receivables based on factors including payment history  the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors  the value of the underlying collateral  the operations and operating trends of the underlying collateral  if any  and current economic conditions  among others 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates we may not recover the full value of the receivable  we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate will not be recovered 
this analysis requires us to determine whether there are factors indicating a receivable may not be fully collectible and to estimate the amount of the receivable that will not be collected 
if our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectibility of a receivable change in the future  we may have to record a reserve to reduce or further reduce the carrying value of the receivable 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in august  sfas no 
was issued 
this pronouncement supersedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
and a portion of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations  reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb no 
and became effective for us on january  sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
as it relates to assets to be held and used and assets to be sold  but adds provisions for assets to be disposed of other than by sale 
it also changes the accounting for the disposal of a segment under apb no 
by requiring the operations of any assets with their own identifiable cash flows that are disposed of or held for sale to be removed from income from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations 
treating such assets as discontinued operations also requires the reclassification of the operations of any such assets for any prior periods presented 
the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material impact on our financial condition or the results of our operations and does not impact net income  however  it has resulted in a caption for discontinued operations being included on our consolidated statements of operations to report the results of operations of assets sold or classified as held for sale during the current period 
the prior period statements of operations presented have been reclassified to reflect the results of operations for these same facilities as discontinued operations in the prior periods 
operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  rental income decreased  or  in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to reserving straight lined rent on certain facilities discussed below  the disposal of facilities since january and rent reductions on certain facilities that were returned to us and leased to other operators in and the decrease was partially offset by the acquisition of facilities during  the conversion of eight facilities totaling  from mortgage loans receivable to owned real estate properties since january  and rent increases at existing facilities 
interest and other income decreased by  or  in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the payoff at par of mortgage loans receivable totaling approximately  securing ten facilities  the conversion of eight facilities totaling approximately  from mortgage loans receivable to owned real estate properties mentioned above and principal repayment of notes receivable  all since january  income from unconsolidated joint venture of  represents our share of the income generated by the joint venture and our management fee of of the revenues of the unconsolidated joint venture 
please see the caption 
investment in unconsolidated joint venture below for more information regarding the unconsolidated joint venture 
interest and amortization of deferred financing costs increased  or less than  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to the issuance of  of fixed rate medium term notes since january   increases in the balance on our bank line of credit  mortgages totaling  secured by existing buildings since december and the assumption of a  mortgage note on one facility acquired during the second quarter of the increase was partially offset by the payoff of  of fixed rate medium term notes since january and a reduction in the average interest rates on our bank line of credit 
depreciation and amortization increased  or  in as compared to the increase was attributable to increased depreciation on the acquisition of facilities during and the conversion of eight facilities totaling  from mortgage loans receivable to owned real estate properties since january  offset by the disposal of facilities since january general and administrative costs increased  or  in as compared to primarily due to approximately  of expense related to the severance of an executive officer partially offset by a reduction in legal expenses related to the prior bankruptcies of certain operators discussed below under the caption 
information regarding certain operators and reductions in other general corporate expenses 
during  we became aware of facts and circumstances indicating that certain assets may have become impaired 
after analyzing the assets and the facts  we recorded an impairment of assets charge in continuing operations totaling  as a result of lower than expected operating results for the first quarter at the former balanced care corporation bcc facilities discussed below under the caption 
information regarding certain operators and six facilities operated by another operator  we changed our estimate of the recoverability of the deferred rent related to these facilities during we determined that the most appropriate method of recognizing revenues for these facilities  given the recent operating results  is to record revenues only to the extent cash is actually received 
accordingly  we fully reserved the deferred rent balance outstanding and all related notes receivable outstanding  totaling approximately  as part of the impairment of assets charge in continuing operations 
in addition  the impairment of assets charge reported in continuing operations also included a reserve of  against a loan previously made to the operator of a large continuing care retirement community in florida 
the collectibility of that loan became uncertain due to developments at the facility during that we believed might necessitate a change in operators 
during  we entered into an agreement with a new operator to take over the facility effective september  during  we classified ten unoccupied buildings and eight land parcels as assets held for sale 
as required by sfas no 
 the net book values of these assets have been transferred to assets held for sale and the operations of these assets have been included in discontinued operations for the years ended december   and please see the caption 
impact of new accounting pronouncements above for more information regarding this treatment 
the impairment of assets charge in discontinued operations totals  and represents the write down of of these assets to their individual estimated fair values less costs to sell 
discontinued operations reflects a loss of  in versus a loss of  in the loss in is primarily due to the impairment of assets charge of  discussed above  partially offset by net gains on the sale of operating assets and assets held for sale during the year of  the income of  for  excluding the impairment of assets and gains on sale of facilities in discontinued operations  reflects the revenues less the depreciation and amortization and other expenses related to the facilities sold or classified as assets held for sale in the loss in is primarily due to an impairment of assets charge of  related to the write down of three skilled nursing facilities to their fair values less costs to sell in that are now reflected in discontinued operations since the facilities were either sold or classified as assets held for sale during the income of  for  excluding the impairment of assets in discontinued operations  reflects the revenues less the depreciation and amortization and other expenses related to the facilities sold or classified as assets held for sale in the income in discontinued operations  excluding the impairment of assets and gains on sale of facilities  is consistent between the two years as there were no significant changes from to in the revenues and expenses related to the facilities sold or classified as assets held for sale in we expect to receive increased rent and interest at individual facilities because our leases and mortgages generally contain provisions under which rents or interest income increase with increases in facility revenues and or increases in the consumer price index 
if revenues at our facilities and or the consumer price index do not increase  our revenues may not continue to increase 
sales of facilities or repayments of mortgage loans receivable would serve to offset revenue increases  and if sales and repayments exceed additional investments this could actually reduce revenues 
our leases could renew below or above the aggregate existing rent level  so the impact of lease renewals may cause a decrease or an increase in the total rent we receive 
the exercise of purchase options by tenants would also cause a decrease in the total rent we receive 
additional investments in healthcare facilities would increase rental and or interest income  however  at this time we do not expect any significant additional investments during the coming year 
as additional investments in facilities are made  depreciation and or interest expense will also increase 
we expect any such increases to be at least partially offset by rent or interest income associated with the investments 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  rental income increased  or less than  in as compared to the increase was primarily a result of one development completed during  a full year of revenues earned by investments in additional facilities in  the conversion of three facilities from mortgage loans receivable to owned real estate properties and the reclassification of rental income to discontinued operations related to facilities disposed of or classified as assets held for sale in the increase was offset by the disposal of facilities during the year  eleven of which were sold in the fourth quarter and a reduction of the rent at certain facilities related to the settlement with certain operators in bankruptcy proceedings as discussed below 
interest and other income decreased by  or  in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the payoff at par of mortgage loans receivable totaling approximately  secured by five facilities  the conversion of three facilities and four land parcels totaling approximately  from mortgage loans receivable to ownership mentioned above and amortization of notes receivable 
interest and amortization of deferred financing costs decreased  or  in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in overall debt levels accomplished with the funds received from the facility sales and mortgage loan receivable payoffs discussed above  and decreases in the average interest rates on our  bank line of credit 
the decrease was partially offset by a reduction in interest capitalized on construction projects 
depreciation and amortization decreased  or  in as compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to the disposal of facilities during the year and the reclassification of depreciation and amortization to discontinued operations related to facilities disposed of or classified as assets held for sale in  partially offset by three facilities converted from mortgage loans receivable to ownership during and a full year of depreciation related to facilities acquired in general and administrative costs increased  or  in as compared to primarily due to increases in legal fees and other costs related to five operators in bankruptcy discussed below and general cost increases 
during  we recorded an impairment of assets charge of  in continuing operations 
this charge included the provision of a reserve against mortgage loans receivable of  the write off of  of deferred rent related to the facilities returned by bcc discussed below under the caption information regarding certain operators and  of receivable write offs and reserves against other assets which we believed had become impaired 
we recorded a net gain of  in related to the disposal of facilities during the year 
discontinued operations reflected a loss of  in versus income of  in the loss in is primarily due to an impairment of assets charge of  related to the write down of three skilled nursing facilities to their fair values less costs to sell in that are now reflected in discontinued operations because the facilities were either sold or classified as assets held for sale during the income of  for  excluding the impairment of assets in discontinued operations  reflects the revenues less the depreciation and amortization and other expenses related to the facilities sold or classified as assets held for sale in the amount reflects only the revenues less the depreciation and other expenses related to the facilities sold or classified as assets held for sale in the decrease in income in discontinued operations  excluding the impairment of assets  is due to lower revenues and higher costs related to the facilities sold or classified as assets held for sale in as some of these facilities were unoccupied in information regarding certain operators we have now concluded our negotiations with all five of our operators that had filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy laws from to these operators included sun healthcare group  inc sun  mariner health care  inc mariner  integrated health services  inc 
integrated  sv home office inc and certain affiliates sv and assisted living concepts  inc alc 
over leveraging of balance sheets  increased wage and salary costs and changes in reimbursement levels during had an adverse impact on the financial performance of some of the companies that operate skilled nursing facilities we own 
in addition  overbuilding in the assisted and independent living sector resulted in lower than anticipated fill rates and rental rates for some of the companies that operate assisted and independent living facilities owned by us 
during  sun  mariner and alc emerged from bankruptcy 
in march  the bankruptcy court approved our final settlement with sun that included its assumption of five leases and rejection of one lease 
in april  the bankruptcy court approved mariner s second amended joint plan of reorganization that resulted in us obtaining ownership of the facility securing our only mortgage loan with mariner 
also in april  the bankruptcy court approved our final settlement with integrated that resulted in the assumption by integrated of the amended leases on five facilities and the rejection of two leases 
over the course of these proceedings  a sun has returned facilities and agreed to a master lease of the remaining five facilities involved in the bankruptcy  b mariner has returned facilities  given us a deed in lieu of foreclosure for a facility that secured a mortgage loan receivable and assumed leases on six facilities  c integrated has returned two facilities and agreed to a master lease of the remaining five facilities  d sv has agreed to assume the lease on one facility  return one facility and extend for five years its mortgage secured by one facility and we agreed to allow it to sell a second closed facility that previously secured the mortgage  and e alc assumed the leases on two facilities and transferred title to us and signed leases on two facilities that had previously secured mortgage loans receivable from alc 
as of december   we have leased of the facilities returned to us to new operators  as well as the facility for which we received a deed in lieu of foreclosure  sold three facilities and expect to sell the remaining facility 
subsequent to our final settlement  sun  in february  announced that it had begun a restructuring of its lease portfolio 
sun has approached many of its landlords  including us  in hopes of obtaining rent moratoriums  rent concessions or lease terminations for certain of its leased facilities 
while we cannot predict the final outcome of sun s restructuring process  it is possible there may be rent concessions  or  some or all of the five remaining facilities we lease to sun may be returned to us 
we believe we have identified parties interested in leasing any of these facilities that might be returned to us  however  the return of the facilities or rent concessions could result in lower rental rates 
in october  one operator of five of our facilities which were previously leased by beverly  alpha healthcare foundation  inc alpha filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy laws 
under bankruptcy statutes  the tenant must either assume our leases or reject them and return the properties to us 
if the tenant assumes the leases  it is required to assume the leases under the existing terms  the court cannot change the rental amount or other lease provisions that could financially impact us 
the tenant s decision whether to assume leases is usually based primarily on whether the properties it operates are providing positive cash flows 
to date  alpha has rejected the lease on one facility that the state it was located in decided to close 
this facility was classified as held for sale and written down to its fair value less costs to sell as part of the impairment of assets charge in discontinued operations 
three of the four remaining facilities provide adequate cash flows to cover the rent under the lease  but there is a possibility that the tenant may decide to reject the leases on any or all of these properties 
while we believe we have identified parties interested in leasing these facilities  any new leases may be at lower rental rates 
all rent due after the filing date has been paid 
in january  alterra  our largest operator  filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy laws 
alterra operates of our facilities  of which are under a master lease with six other individual leases and one mortgage loan receivable cross defaulted to it  and all of the facilities owned by our joint venture which are under two master leases 
we understand that alterra has been restructuring out of court for over two years with a goal of going into the final bankruptcy phase with a selected portfolio of properties that for the most part is intended to be the core of its restructured business 
based on discussions we have had with alterra  we expect that it will continue to pay the rent on and affirm all of our leases 
the two master leases in the joint venture  our master lease and six of our seven leases cross defaulted with our master lease generate sufficient cash flows to cover the rent due under the leases 
alterra has paid all monthly rent to date on a timely basis 
if alterra decides to reject the leases  we believe we could lease the facilities covered by the leases to a new operator at rates substantially consistent with what we currently receive  however  it is possible that any such new leases may be at lower rental rates 
effective april   we leased ten facilities that had previously been leased by bcc to a new private operator  senior services of america  after bcc defaulted on its leases in december the facilities were constructed and opened during and with an aggregate investment of approximately  the bcc leases were terminated effective as of january  during  we recognized revenues on a straight lined basis related to these buildings in excess of cash received of approximately  as a result of lower than expected operating results in  we fully reserved the deferred rent receivable balance outstanding as discussed above under the caption operating results and are now recognizing revenue from this lease on a cash basis 
investment in unconsolidated joint venture during  we entered into a joint venture with an institutional investor that may invest up to  in health care facilities similar to those already owned by us 
we are a equity partner in the venture 
the financial statements of the joint venture are not consolidated with our financial statements and our investment is accounted for using the equity method 
no investments were made by or into this joint venture prior to in  the joint venture acquired assisted living facilities in states for a total cost of approximately  that are leased to alterra 
the joint venture also incurred deferred financing costs of approximately  and is committed to fund an additional  of capital improvements 
the acquisitions were financed with secured non recourse debt of approximately  a capital contribution from our joint venture partner of approximately  and a capital contribution from us of approximately  in october  the joint venture sold three facilities for  or approximately their book value 
we do not expect to make any additional contributions to the joint venture related to the facilities it acquired during liquidity and capital resources during  we acquired skilled nursing facilities  eleven assisted and independent living facilities and one continuing care retirement community in six separate transactions for an aggregate investment of approximately  including the assumption of approximately  of secured debt on one facility 
additionally  we funded approximately  in capital improvements at certain facilities in accordance with certain existing lease provisions 
such capital improvements generally result in an increase in the minimum rents earned by us on these facilities 
the acquisitions and capital improvements were funded by the issuance of  of fixed rate medium term notes  borrowings on our bank line of credit and cash on hand 
during  we sold eleven buildings and one land parcel in twelve separate transactions for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately  we also recorded receivables totaling approximately  related to three of these sales 
we provided a mortgage loan with a net amount of  related to the sale of one of the skilled nursing facilities 
three buildings were written down to their estimated fair value less costs to sell during and two buildings and the land parcel were written down during the sale of these buildings resulted in an aggregate gain of  that is included in discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of operations 
the proceeds from the sales were used to repay borrowings on our bank line of credit 
during  one mortgage loan receivable with an aggregate net book value of approximately  secured by one skilled nursing facility and one continuing care retirement community was prepaid in full 
in addition  portions of three mortgage loans receivable totaling  secured by two skilled nursing facilities  one assisted and independent living facility and one continuing care retirement community were also prepaid at par 
the proceeds from the repayments were used to repay borrowings on our bank line of credit

we anticipate the potential repayment of certain mortgage loans receivable and the possible sale of certain facilities during in the event that there are mortgage loan receivable repayments or facility sales in excess of new investments  revenues may decrease 
we anticipate using the proceeds from any mortgage loans receivable repayments or facility sales to reduce the outstanding balance on our bank line of credit  to repay other borrowings as they mature or to provide capital for future investments 
any such reduction in debt levels would result in reduced interest expense that we believe would partially offset any decrease in revenues 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity and financing capability to finance anticipated future investments  maintain our current dividend level and repay borrowings at or prior to their maturity  for at least the next twelve months

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our mortgage loans receivable and debt 
we do not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the purpose of the following analyses is to provide a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  readers are cautioned that many of the statements contained in these paragraphs are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading 
statement regarding forward looking disclosure set forth above 
we provide mortgage loans to operators of healthcare facilities as part of our normal operations 
the majority of the loans have fixed rates 
three of our mortgage loans have adjustable rates  however  the rates adjust only once or twice over the term of the loans and the minimum adjusted rates are equal to the then current rates 
therefore  all mortgage loans receivable are treated as fixed rate notes in the table and analysis below 
we utilize debt financing primarily for the purpose of making additional investments in healthcare facilities 
historically  we have made short term borrowings on our variable rate bank line of credit to fund our acquisitions until market conditions were appropriate  based on management s judgment  to issue stock or fixed rate debt to provide long term financing 
a portion of our secured debt is variable rate debt in the form of housing revenue bonds that were assumed in connection with the acquisition of certain healthcare facilities 
pursuant to the associated lease arrangements  increases or decreases in the interest rates on the housing revenue bonds would be substantially offset by increases or decreases in the rent received by us on the properties securing this debt 
therefore  there is substantially no market risk associated with this variable rate secured debt 
we have  of secured debt at a floating rate with a floor of that has been at the floor since it was issued in we do not believe there is any significant market risk related to this debt as it matures in for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect the future earnings and cash flows 
we generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
holding the variable rate debt balance constant  and including the bank borrowings as variable rate debt due to its nature  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  the table below details the principal amounts and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt for each category based on the final maturity dates 
certain of the mortgage loans receivable and certain items in the various categories of debt require periodic principal payments prior to the final maturity date 
the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity 
maturity date thereafter total fair value dollars in thousands assets mortgage loans receivable average interest rate liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate bank borrowings average interest rate decreases in interest rates during resulted in a decrease in interest expense related to our bank line of credit 
these interest rate decreases have made it less expensive for us to borrow on our bank line of credit 
any future interest rate increases will increase the cost of borrowings on our bank line of credit and any borrowings to refinance long term debt as it matures or finance future acquisitions
