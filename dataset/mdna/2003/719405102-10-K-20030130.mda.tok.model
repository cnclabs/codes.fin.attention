item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the years ended november   october  and overview in  the company completed the acquisition of a majority equity interest approximately in pkl ltd 
pkl  a leading korean photomask supplier  for million 
in april  the company acquired an additional of pkl in exchange for  shares of photronics common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly goodwill in the aggregate of million was recorded 
the operating results of pkl have been included in the company s consolidated statements of operations since august  in june  the company completed its merger with align rite international  inc align rite  an independent publicly traded manufacturer of photomasks in the united states and europe 
under the terms of the merger agreement  each of the  shares of common stock of align rite issued and outstanding as of june  was converted into shares of common stock of photronics 
cash was paid in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares of photronics that would otherwise have been issued 
any stock options to acquire align rite common stock that had not been exercised as of june  became fully vested options to acquire photronics common stock in accordance with the merger agreement 
the company recorded expenses of million in fiscal relating to costs incurred in connection with this transaction 
such costs consisted primarily of fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants  financial printing and other related charges 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements  the accompanying notes and this management s discussion and analysis have been restated to reflect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows as if align rite was a consolidated  wholly owned subsidiary of the company for all periods presented 
in june  the company acquired a majority share of precision semiconductor mask corporation psmc  a photomask manufacturer based in taiwan  for approximately million in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
the operating results of psmc have been included in the company s consolidated statement of operations from june  the company s growth in recent years has also been affected by the rapid technological changes taking place in the semiconductor industry resulting in a greater mix of high end photomask requirements for more complex integrated circuit designs 
during the latter half of and continuing throughout  the company was impacted by the downturn in the semiconductor industry which resulted in decreased demand and increased competitive pricing pressures 
the company cannot predict the duration of such cyclical industry conditions or their impact on its future operating results 
both revenues and costs have been affected by the increased demand for high end technology photomasks that require more advanced manufacturing capabilities but generally command higher average selling prices 
to meet the technological demands of its customers and position the company for future growth  the company continues to make substantial investments in high end manufacturing capability both at existing and new facilities 
the company s capital expenditures for new facilities and equipment to support its customers requirements for high technology products was approximately million for the three fiscal years ended november   resulting in significant increases in operating expenses 
based on the anticipated technological changes in the industry  the company expects these trends to continue 
the company believes that changes in photomask demand reflect changes in semiconductor design activity and are only indirectly affected by changes in semiconductor sales volumes 
in the past  increased design activity has been stimulated by both the rapid development of new generation semiconductor designs and the proliferation of application specific integrated circuits 
while design activity has continued  the company was impacted by the reductions in design releases for production during the latter half of as a result of the depressed semiconductor industry 
results of operations the following table represents selected operating information expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended november  october  october  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses consolidation  restructuring and related charges operating income net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended november  increased to million  compared to million in primarily as a result of increased growth in asia as a result of inclusion of our majority held subsidiary in korea for the increase  however  was partially mitigated by decreased sales in north america  as certain north american customers moved their semiconductor manufacturing to foundries located in asia

other factors contributing to the increased sales in include an improved sales mix of high end technology products  which have design rules of micron and below and increased unit volume associated with increased design releases 
the increased design releases were primarily experienced during the first six months of the year 
sales decreased during the second half of due to a slow down in new design releases for mature and high end technology products  due in part  to the decreased end user demand  both consumer and corporate  for devices utilizing semiconductors and continued increased competitive pricing pressures for mature products 
as a result of the continued downturn in the global semiconductor industry  the company continues to see weaknesses in selling prices for mature technologies but has benefited from its investments in high end manufacturing capability and increased global presence 
net sales for the fiscal year ended october  increased to million  compared to million in  as a result of the company s continued global expansion  and an improved sales mix of high end technology products  which have higher average selling prices and increased unit volume associated with increased design releases

application of critical accounting procedures the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations 
consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of photronics  inc and its majority owned subsidiaries photronics or the company  in which the company exercises control 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in them 
actual results may differ from such estimates 
derivative investments and hedging activities the company records derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are reported in the consolidated statement of operations or as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity  depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items during the term of the hedge 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
repairs and maintenance as well as renewals and replacements of a routine nature are charged to operations as incurred  while those which improve or extend the lives of existing assets are capitalized 
upon sale or other disposition  the cost of the asset and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income 
for financial reporting purposes  depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years  machinery and equipment over to years and furniture  fixtures and office equipment over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement  whichever is less 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is computed on the basis of consolidated financial statement income 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
foreign currency translation the company s foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounts in their respective local currencies 
assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries are translated to us dollars at year end exchange rates 
income and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
foreign currency translation adjustments are accumulated and reported as other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the effects of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency transactions are included in income 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of goods to customers

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company records derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are reported in the statement of operations or as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity  depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items during the term of the hedge 
in general  the types of risks hedged are those relating to the variability of future cash flows caused by movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of and during the term of each hedge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company entered into an interest rate swap contract the contract  which effectively converted million of its fixed rate convertible notes to a variable rate 
contract payments are made on a libor based variable rate at november  and are received at the fixed rate 
the contract is used to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to fixed interest rates 
this contract is considered to be a hedge against changes in the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt obligation 
accordingly  the contract has been reflected at fair value in the company s consolidated balance sheet and the related portion of fixed rate debt being hedged is reflected at an amount equal to the sum of its carrying value plus an adjustment representing the change in fair value of the debt obligation attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged 
in addition  changes during any accounting period in the fair value of the contract  as well as offsetting changes in the adjusted carrying value of the related portion of fixed rate debt being hedged  are recognized as adjustments to interest expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the net effect of this accounting on the company s operations results is that the interest expense portion of fixed rate debt being hedged is generally recorded based on variable rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in several major international currencies through its worldwide operations and is subject to changes in foreign exchange rates of such currencies 
changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company s sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital  there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company s worldwide operations 
the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
the company does not believe that a change in exchange rates would have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk the majority of the company s borrowings are in the form of its convertible subordinated notes  which bear interest rates ranging from to and certain foreign secured and unsecured notes payable which bear interest between approximately and 
in addition  the interest rate swap contract discussed above subjects the company to market risk as interest rates fluctuate and impact the interest payments due on the million notional amount of the contract 
the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly 
the company does not believe that a change in interest rates would have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
