item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the discussion in this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
additional information relating to forward looking statements is included in this report under the caption special note regarding forward looking statements 
overview we source and deliver the most critical component of industry human capital 
as a leading talent source  we provide specialized professionals on a short term contract and permanent basis 
we deliver it professionals to vendors and users of leading edge technologies  and to vertical markets including government services  banking and finance  medical technology and energy services 
on august   we acquired substantially all the assets of onstaff  a privately held group of companies that provides short term corporate contract and permanent employees in the real estate  finance and healthcare industries 
with the acquisition of onstaff  we expanded our service offerings  increased our offices  and added online recruiting and placement websites 
the results of operations for fiscal include the operations of onstaff from the beginning of august our contract professional staffing group provides specialized professionals on a short term contract basis and accounted for of our net revenues in  in  and in our permanent placement services group provides specialized professionals on a permanent basis and accounted for of our net revenues in  in  and in our net revenues are derived principally from the hourly billings of our professionals on contract assignments and from fees received for permanent placements 
contract services assignments typically last two to six months  and revenues are recognized as services are provided 
we derive contract services revenues when our consultants are working  and therefore our operating results may be adversely affected when client facilities are closed due to holidays or inclement weather 
as a result  we typically experience relatively lower net revenues in our first and fourth fiscal quarters 
we derive permanent placement revenues upon permanent placement of each professional candidate 
the fee is typically structured as a percentage of the placed professional s first year annual compensation 
permanent placement revenues are recognized when a professional commences employment or  in the case of retained searches  upon completion of our contractual obligations 
revenue from online recruiting and placement web sites is recognized over the term of membership 
while no one customer represents greater than of our total revenue during the year  we do have a number of larger customers  some of which have issued earnings warnings and delayed a number of their projects 
as a result of the continuing general economic slowdown  we reported a decrease in revenue and gross profit in as compared to the prior year and recorded a million charge for impairment of goodwill see note to consolidated financial statements 
during  we closed several offices  reduced our workforce  and restructured the organizational management and operations 
we continued to decrease  through restructuring or attrition  the number of sales  sales support and administrative employees in to individuals as of december  from individuals as of december   representing a decrease in headcount 
the number of revenue producing sales and sales support employees included in the overall headcount decreased to as of december  from as of december   representing a decrease 
our contract professional employee headcount increased to  at december  from as of december   an increase of  principally in the corporate professional division as a result of the acquisition of onstaff  offset by a decrease in it professionals 
on march  we announced the restructuring of the technology professional division  resulting in the closure of offices and elimination of jobs 
the number of sales  sales support and administrative employees after the terminations announced in march was expected to be  which is fewer than the number on december  and fewer than december  operating costs in were lower than as a result of the restructuring of operations in and the impact of restructuring on operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses were reduced in over although results include a charge of million for impairment of goodwill  the results included impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets totaling million 
however  if the economic conditions in the united states do not improve or if a wider or global economic slowdown occurs  we may continue to experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
critical accounting policies allowances for doubtful accounts receivable we establish allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments based on the aging of our accounts receivable  analysis of specific delinquent accounts  and our historical write off experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  we reported a direct accounts receivable write off of million resulting from bankruptcies  company closures and delinquent accounts 
as of december   accounts receivable were million  net of allowances of million 
valuation of net deferred tax assets as of december   deferred tax assets  net  were million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
the net deferred tax asset consists primarily of net operating loss carryforwards of million and temporary differences of million 
realization of the loss carry forwards is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions prior to expiration of the loss carry forwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that such loss carry forwards will be realized 
the amount of the loss carryforwards that is considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets as of december   goodwill was million and other identifiable intangible assets were million 
the recoverability of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets is based on assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these assumptions and estimates change in the future  additional expense may be recorded to reflect impairment of these assets

the decrease in net revenues was due primarily to the continued softening of the technology sector of the economy and slack demand  which resulted in a significant decrease in the number of new it assignments 
partially offsetting this decline was the acquisition of the onstaff business  and the increase in real estate related assignments in the corporate professional division fueled by low interest rates and the strong demand for mortgage financing and refinancings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the bank line of credit at an interest rate of 
the credit facility was amended on march  to increase the interest to the lender s prime rate plus as of march   to increase to prime plus beginning june   and to increase to prime plus beginning september  the interest rate will increase or decrease as economic conditions change 
an immediate change in interest rates would be immaterial to our financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the united kingdom pound is the functional currency of our subsidiary in the united kingdom and the japanese yen is the functional currency in our branch office in japan 
we do not currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
however  we do maintain cash balances denominated in the united kingdom pound and japanese yen 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by percent from the exchange rates at december   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by an immaterial amount
