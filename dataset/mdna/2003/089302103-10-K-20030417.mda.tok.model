critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has certain critical accounting policies and accounting estimates  which are described below 
merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis  primarily on the retail method 
certain assumptions are made to properly record inventory at the lower of cost or market  and these assumptions are based on historical experience and current information 
the company s assumptions include significant judgments and estimates made by management including merchandise markup  markdowns  shrinkage  and the aging of inventories  each of which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
due to the nature of the company s purchasing practices for closeout and deeply discounted merchandise  vendors and merchandise suppliers generally do not offer the company incentives such as slotting fees  cooperative advertising allowances  buydown agreements  or other forms of rebates that would materially reduce its cost of sales 
property and equipment 
depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
service lives are principally forty years for buildings and from three to fifteen years for other property and equipment 
impairment 
the company has long lived assets that consist primarily of property and equipment 
the company estimates useful lives on buildings and equipment using assumptions based on historical data and industry trends 
where there is an indication of impairment  the company evaluates the fair value and future benefits of the related long lived asset  and the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows from the related asset is calculated and compared to the carrying value on the company s books 
the company s assumptions related to estimates of future cash flows are based on historical results of cash flows adjusted for management projections for future periods taking into account known conditions and planned future activities 
the company s assumptions regarding the fair value of its long lived assets are based on the discounted future cash flows 
page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued insurance reserves 
the company is self insured for certain losses relating to general liability  workers compensation  and employee medical benefit claims  and the company has purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit significant exposure in these areas 
accrued insurance liabilities are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
such amounts are determined by applying actuarially based calculations taking into account known trends and projections of future results 
actual claims experience can impact these calculations and  to the extent that subsequent claim costs vary from estimates  future earnings could be impacted and the impact could be material 
income taxes 
the company has generated deferred tax assets or liabilities due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the company has established a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company records liabilities relating to income taxes utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
pension liabilities 
pension and other retirement benefits  including all relevant assumptions required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  are evaluated each year 
due to the technical nature of retirement accounting  outside actuaries are used to provide assistance in calculating the estimated future obligations 
since there are many estimates and assumptions involved in retirement benefits  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to pension expenses and obligations 
such assumptions include the discount rate  rate of increase in compensation levels  and the expected long term rate of return on the related assets 
legal obligations 
in the normal course of business  the company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities  which requires the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process  however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be materially different from management s estimates and adjustments to income could be required 
the assumptions that are used by management are based on the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the company will record a liability related to legal obligations when it has determined that it is probable that the company will be obligated to pay and the related amount can be reasonably estimated  and it will disclose the related facts in the footnotes to its financial statements  if material 
if the company determines that either an obligation is probable or reasonably possible  the company will  if material  disclose the nature of the loss contingency and the estimated range of possible loss  or include a statement that no estimate of loss can be made 
the company makes these determinations in consultation with its outside legal advisors 
cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise including related inbound freight  markdowns and inventory shortage  as well as cash discounts and rebates 
the company classifies purchasing and receiving costs  inspection costs  warehousing costs  internal transfer costs  and the other distribution network costs as selling and administrative expenses 
due to this classification  the company s gross margins may not be comparable to those of other retailers that include costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales 
selling and administrative expenses 
the company includes store expenses such as payroll and occupancy costs  warehousing and distribution costs  advertising  buying  depreciation  insurance  and overhead costs in selling and administrative expenses
