for example  in january  the company s largest customer in the component products segment informed the company that it no longer required the company s products because the customer could satisfy its needs internally 
this customer accounted for approximately million in annual revenues in results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  the percentage of revenues represented by the items as shown in the company s consolidated statements of operations net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charge operating income loss total other expenses  net loss income before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net loss income compared to the company s net sales decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in component products segment sales decreased to million primarily due to a decline in sales associated with the phase out of the woodbridge automotive program in georgia 
this decline was partially offset by new automotive programs launched in late as well as during packaging sales increased slightly to million from million in primarily as a result of the acquisition of excel foams in alabama partially offset by the impact on sales of plant closures as well as softer demand within the electronics industry 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended december  from in the increase is primarily due to lower fixed operating costs resulting from plant consolidations completed in early selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased to million in the year ended december   from million in as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased to in from in the decrease in sg a is primarily attributable to company wide cost control efforts  and the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which ceased goodwill amortization on january  goodwill amortization for the year ended december  was approximately interest expense decreased to  in  from  in  primarily as a result of lower interest rates 
the company had a tax benefit of of its pre tax loss in the tax benefit reflects the expected utilization of a net operating loss generated during the year 
in  the company had an effective tax benefit of approximately of pre tax losses 
the company has recorded a deferred net tax asset of million  of which million relates to the expected benefit of net operating losses 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  the company believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the company has considered both positive and negative available evidence in its determination that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
while current economic conditions  including a current year book loss  provide evidence that the deferred tax assets may not be fully realized  the cyclical nature of the industry sector and recent historical experience of income provide objective positive evidence that the deferred tax assets are recoverable 
the company believes that its efforts to right size the business in fiscal will be an important factor in achieving future profitability 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
compared to the company s net sales decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in specialty segment sales decreased to million  primarily due to a decline in automotive sales because of the loss of a million annual program as well as a general business decline in packaging segment sales declined to million  primarily due to declined demand in the electronics components industry 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended december   from in the decrease is primarily due to fixed overhead costs measured against lower sales as well as the cost of plant moves in california and michigan 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased to million in the year ended december   from million in as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to in from in the decrease in sg a dollars is primarily attributable to cost control efforts 
the increase in sg a as a percentage of sales reflects the sharp decline in sales  in relation to the fixed nature of the expenses 
interest decreased to  in  from  in  primarily as a result of lower interest rates 
the company had a tax benefit of of its pre tax loss in the tax benefit reflects the expected utilization of a net operating loss generated during the year  a portion of which will be carried back to prior years through amended tax returns 
in  the company had an effective tax rate of approximately 
restructuring on december   the company s board of directors approved a formal plan of restructure in response to the downturn in the packaging industry 
to that effect  the company recorded restructuring charges of  in the th quarter of of this amount   remains on the balance sheet  primarily reflecting lease payments to be made on vacated properties after december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company funds its operating expenses  capital requirements and growth plan through internally generated cash  bank credit facilities and long term capital leases 
as of december  and  working capital was  and  respectively 
the increase in working capital is primarily attributable to the impact on the current portion of long term debt of refinancing the company s credit facility in february  cash provided from operations was  and  for and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in was million and was used primarily for the acquisition of new manufacturing equipment 
including amounts due under the revolving credit facility and capital lease obligations  the company had total debt outstanding of  and  at december  and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the excess of cash generated from operations over amounts used to acquire manufacturing equipment  partially offset by amounts used to acquire excel packaging in january as of december  the company had a  revolving bank line expiring on april   of which  was outstanding 
at december   the company had two additional loans outstanding 
the first is a  term loan with a five year straight line amortization that is secured by the company s machinery and equipment and had an outstanding balance of  at december  the second is a five year first mortgage for  with a fifteen year amortization and is collateralized by the company s real estate in georgetown  massachusetts and had a balance of  at december  on february  the company obtained a new credit facility 
the facility includes a revolving credit facility of million collateralized by the company s accounts receivable and inventory  a term loan collateralized by the company s property  plant and equipment of million with a six year amortization and a term loan collateralized by a mortgage on the company s real estate located in georgetown  massachusetts of million with a year amortization 
the company s new million revolving credit facility is due february   and the term loan and mortgage are due february  extensions of credit under this facility are subject to available collateral based upon accounts receivable and inventory levels 
therefore  the entire million may not be available to the company 
for example  as of february   based upon borrowings outstanding of million and collateral levels  the company had availability of million of additional credit under this facility 
the amount of availability can fluctuate significantly 
the credit facility calls for interest of prime or libor plus on the revolving credit facility and prime plus or libor plus on the term debt 
both components allow for reduction in rates based upon the company s operating performance 
under this new credit facility  the company is subject to certain financial covenants  including certain minimum ebitda  fixed charge coverage and tangible net worth covenants 
in connection with a recently awarded automotive program  the company has committed to purchase a new forming line for approximately million in  and a second similar forming line for approximately million in the company expects to enter into capital leases to finance the purchase of both machines however  there can be no assurances that such financing will be available at favorable terms  if at all 
as of december   the company has made a progress payment of approximately  on the first forming line 
the company has no additional significant capital commitments in  but plans on adding additional machinery to increase capacity or to enhance operating efficiencies in its manufacturing plants 
additionally  the company may consider the acquisition of companies  technologies or products in  which are complementary to its business 
the company believes that its existing resources  including its revolving loan facility  together with cash generated from operations and funds expected to be available to it through any necessary equipment financing and additional bank borrowings  will be sufficient to fund its cash flow requirements through at least the end of however  there can be no assurances that such financing will be available at favorable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its cash flow in future periods payments due in operating leases capital leases term loan mortgage total thereafter the company requires cash to pay its operating expenses  purchase capital equipment  and to service the obligations listed above 
the company s principal sources of funds are its operations and its revolving credit facility 
although the company generated cash from operations in the year ended december   it cannot guarantee that its operations will generate cash in future periods 
other a significant portion of the company s packaging sales of molded fiber products are to manufacturers of computer peripherals and other consumer products 
as a result  the company believes that its sales are somewhat seasonal  with increased sales in the second half of the year 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations in the last three years 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  including current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions both in general and specifically in relation to the packaging industry  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company has reviewed these policies with its audit committee revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time of shipment which is typically when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance of its obligation is complete  its price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and the company is reasonably assured of collecting 
if a loss is anticipated on any contract  a provision for the entire loss is made immediately 
revenue recognition involves judgments and assessments of expected returns  and the likelihood of nonpayment due to insolvent customers 
the company analyzes various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 
long lived assets and intangible assets the company reviews long lived assets and all intangible assets  including goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is also reviewed at least annually for impairment 
recoverability of long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate  to the carrying amount 
if the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets  then long lived assets are written down to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending upon the nature of the assets 
recoverability of goodwill is determined under a two step process as described in sfas the fair value of reporting units determined under step one is also based on a discounted cash flow model 
at december   no impairment has been identified 
forecasted cash flows are based upon numerous assumptions used by management  such as revenue growth  margins and asset management 
for purposes of this analysis  the company reviews its internal forecasts and external data 
the external data consist of data available from customer and competitor commentary  as well as industry forecasts of future revenue growth 
the estimates of expected cash flows require the company to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of the company s control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or economic conditions were to further deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  with a resulting charge to results of operations 
inventory the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
the company fully reserves for inventories deemed obsolete 
the company performs periodic reviews of all inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand  based upon sales and marketing inputs through its planning systems 
if estimates of demand diminish further or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required with a resulting charge to operations 
deferred income taxes the company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of the company s market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and equity prices 
at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents consisted of bank accounts in us dollars  and their valuation would not be affected by market risk 
the company has three debt instruments where interest is based upon the prime rate and or libor and  therefore  future operations could be affected by interest rate changes  however  the company believes that the market risk of the debt is minimal
