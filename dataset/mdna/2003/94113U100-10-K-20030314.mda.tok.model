item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  included herein 
for periods prior to the spin off from ati  the financial statements include the businesses described below on a combined basis 
some of the statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  some of which are described below

overview of business water pik technologies is a leader in designing  manufacturing and marketing a broad range of well recognized personal health care products  swimming pool products and water heating systems 
we operate in two business segments the personal health care segment and the pool products and heating systems segment 
the personal health care segment designs  manufactures and markets personal health care products including showerheads  consumer and professional oral health products  water filtration products and personal stress relief products 
the pool products and heating systems segment designs  manufactures and markets swimming pool and spa heaters  electronic controls  valves  pumps  filters  water features and residential and commercial water heating systems 
in december  we formalized a plan to dispose of our ozone product line  a component of the personal health care segment 
the ozone product line includes the aquia home sanitizing product introduced in september we have decided that the promotional investment necessary to create the market for consumer products based on this technology is significantly greater than the available resources 
we expect that disposition through the sale of the ozone product line will be completed by december the operating results of the discontinued product line have been reported separately as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and the assets and liabilities have been reclassified to other assets and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
all discussions and amounts herein for all years presented relate to continuing operations only unless otherwise noted 
as such  some discussions related to prior years have been modified to reflect information on continuing operations only 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses water pik technologies consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the buyer s price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including promotions  cooperative advertising programs and other volume based incentives 
should the costs under these customer programs and incentive offerings exceed those estimated  additional reductions to revenue may be required 
we also allow credit for products returned within our policy terms 
we record an allowance for estimated returns  based on historical experience  at the time of sale 
should the actual returns exceed those estimated  additional reductions to revenue and cost of sales may be required 
accounts receivable we market our products to a diverse customer base  principally throughout the united states and canada 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers 
additionally  we offer extended payment terms to pool products customers to encourage them to purchase products generally during the fourth quarter to better enable utilization of manufacturing capacity 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined through review of their current credit information 
we also insure selected high risk receivables from time to time to reduce our risk of credit loss 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for water pik technologies  inc estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified 
if the financial condition of our customers  including scp pool corporation  which accounts for approximately percent and percent of accounts receivable at december  and  respectively  were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and related bad debt expense may be required 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory last in  first out lifo and first in first out fifo cost methods or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
this can occur if there is a decline in demand for our existing products or if the market does not accept our new or enhanced products 
market acceptance of new products is regularly evaluated after product launch 
generally  following introduction of a new product  we allow months  depending on the product category  before writing down the inventory as obsolete or unmarketable 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranties we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties  based on historical experience and any identified product quality issues  at the time revenue is recognized 
while we have comprehensive product quality programs and processes  including extensive testing during the new product development process and active monitoring and evaluation of our component suppliers  the warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability and an increase in warranty expense may be required 
deferred income taxes we have not recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets as we believe that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are determined using a combination of accelerated and straight line methods over the estimated useful lives of the various asset classes 
we estimate the useful lives of property  plant and equipment based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
should the actual useful lives be less than those estimated  additional depreciation expense may be required 
long lived assets impairment we currently evaluate long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors  including the discount rate used  to calculate the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
insurance reserves and legal contingencies we record loss accruals to cover the portion of general liability  product liability and workers compensation  both asserted claims and incurred but not reported claims  not covered by insurance policies 
such accruals are estimated based on information provided by our insurance company  claims adjusters and insurance broker  taking into account prior experience  numbers of claims  discussions with legal counsel and other relevant factors 
should the number of claims or the actual outcome of any claim result in losses in excess of amounts accrued  an adjustment to the loss accruals and increase in expense may be required

gross profit decreased  to  in from  in due to lower sales volume 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was percent for compared with percent for the improvement in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to a mix shift to more profitable personal health care products

gross profit increased  to  for from  in due to the increase in sales 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to percent in from percent in due primarily to the impact of lower than expected sales volume resulting in fixed manufacturing costs increasing as a percentage of sales  higher costs associated with the launch of new products and to costs related to a workforce reduction in fourth quarter the segment experienced increases in fixed manufacturing costs related to new product introductions 
the weak us economy and slower retail distribution rollout of new products resulted in lower than expected sales 
in response to lower than anticipated demand resulting from the weak us economy  we implemented cost savings initiatives throughout  including a workforce reduction 
the segment incurred  in severance and related costs in fourth quarter in conjunction with the workforce reduction 
other new product related cost increases included warranty provisions and in bound freight incurred to expedite initial orders of sourced products 
operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to percent in from percent in the decrease in gross profit  as described above  and increased advertising and other selling expenses related primarily to new product launches were partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses

gross profit decreased  to  in from  in due primarily to the decrease in sales volume and to the increase in sales incentives as discussed above 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to percent in from percent in the decrease in gross profit percentage is primarily due to the lower sales volume and to higher sales incentives 
the gross profit percentage was also negatively impacted by increased warranty costs in as compared to operating profit decreased  to  in from  in primarily due to the sales decline described above and to increased selling and research and development expenses related to new product development activities partially offset by a  decrease in goodwill amortization 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales in the pool products and heating systems segment were  in  a decrease of  or percent from sales in the first half decreased  or percent primarily due to the challenging us economic environment compounded by high customer inventory levels resulting from aggressive customer purchasing during the fourth quarter  unusually wet weather patterns in the sunbelt states and a prolonged winter in the northern states in compared to as is customary with industry practice  the pool products and heating systems segment offers incentive programs and extended payment terms to encourage pool products customers to purchase products generally during the fourth quarter to enable better utilization of manufacturing capacity

we anticipate that our operating cash flow  together with available borrowings under the credit facilities described below  will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  fund capital expenditures and make scheduled principal and interest payments on its debt obligations for at least the next months 
however  a decrease in demand for our products due to risk factors discussed in part i of this report or deterioration in our financial ratios under our credit facilities could adversely affect our liquidity 
cash increased  to  at december  from  at december  cash provided by operating activities of  related to continuing water pik technologies  inc operations and proceeds of  from the issuance of promissory notes under our equipment financing facility were used to fund capital expenditures of  to repay borrowings under revolving credit facilities of  and to make scheduled payments on promissory notes of  net cash provided by operations in results primarily from income from continuing operations of  adjusted for non cash items including depreciation and amortization expense and to an increase in accrued liabilities 
this was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory and a decrease in accrued income taxes 
the increase in accrued liabilities is primarily due to customers achieving higher volume rebate levels in and to increased warranty accruals 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to increases at both segments 
pool products and heating systems segment accounts receivable increased due to higher fourth quarter sales in as compared to including sales under seasonal selling programs with extended payment terms 
personal health care segment accounts receivable increased primarily due to a shift in sales to specialty stores and hardware stores with longer terms than sales to mass merchandisers and to sales related to new store openings which generally have longer payment terms 
the increase in inventory is primarily due to the addition of new product inventory at the personal health care segment and to lower than expected sales 
accrued income taxes decreased primarily due to lower taxable income in as compared to in  cash provided by financing activities of  and cash provided by operating activities of  related to continuing operations were used to fund capital expenditures of  and to fund operations and capital expenditures related to the discontinued ozone product line 
working capital increased to  at december  from  at december  the current ratio increased to at december  from at december  the increase in working capital is primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories as discussed above 
we have general liability  product liability and workers compensation insurance programs 
insurance coverage under these programs is subject to policy deductibles for which we are at risk for losses 
the actual settlements or other resolution of claims under these insurance programs may differ from estimated reserves  but the possible range of loss in excess of those accrued is not reasonably estimable 
based upon currently available information  we do not believe that resolution of any pending insurance claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period and ultimately could affect our insurance premiums or our ability to obtain insurance coverage 
in connection with the spin off  ati received a tax ruling from the irs stating that the spin off would be tax free to ati and to ati s stockholders 
the tax sharing and indemnification agreement between the company and ati provides that we will indemnify ati and its directors  officers  agents and representatives for any taxes imposed on  and other amounts paid by  them or ati s stockholders if we take actions or fail to take actions  that result in the spin off not qualifying as a tax free distribution 
the significant restrictions imposed by the tax sharing and indemnification agreement expired on november  and the remaining restrictions expired on january  if any of the taxes or other amounts were to become payable by us  the payment could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financials condition and cash flow 
we have a  revolving bank credit facility that expires in november borrowings under the facility are limited to borrowing base calculations based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances 
the credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to the borrowing base less the outstanding line of credit  not to exceed  at december   there were  in borrowings and  in letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility with  of borrowing availability remaining under borrowing base limitations of the credit facility 
our canadian subsidiary has a cdn 
 revolving bank line of credit facility  increasing by cdn 
 for certain months of the year  a forward exchange contract facility of up to cdn

on october   we entered into a real estate financing agreement with a bank and mortgaged our four us manufacturing facilities to secure four promissory notes totaling  the notes bear interest at libor london interbank offered rate plus to basis points per annum 
the notes require monthly payments of approximately  plus accrued interest through august with a final principal payment of  and accrued interest due on september  the balance outstanding at december  was  water pik technologies  inc on december   we entered into a  equipment financing agreement with a bank 
initial borrowings under the agreement of  were funded on december  and are evidenced by two term notes secured by specific machinery and equipment located at our manufacturing facilities 
the notes require quarterly payments of  plus accrued interest beginning on april  with all unpaid principal balances and accrued interest due on january  in january  we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert the variable rate interest on the  promissory notes payable to a fixed rate of percent 
the interest rate swap expires on january  interest differentials to be paid or received because of the swap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the related period that the debt is outstanding 
on september   we borrowed an additional  under the equipment financing agreement evidenced by two term notes secured by specific machinery and equipment located at our manufacturing facilities and at certain vendors facilities 
the notes require quarterly payments of  beginning on december  with all unpaid principal balances and accrued interest due on september  the balance outstanding under this agreement at december  was  no additional amounts can be borrowed under this agreement 
our revolving credit facilities and mortgage notes require us or our subsidiaries to comply with various financial covenants and restrictions  including covenants and restrictions relating to indebtedness  liens  investments  dividend payments  consolidated net worth  interest coverage  fixed charge coverage  capital expenditures and the relationship of our total consolidated indebtedness to its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
a security interest in substantially all of our assets was granted as collateral to the lenders under the credit agreements 
to the extent that we are not able to comply with the financial covenants  we may be unable to borrow additional amounts and outstanding amounts may become due on an accelerated basis  which would adversely affect our liquidity 
due to the seasonality of our pool products business  the extended payment term receivables offered during the winter months are collected during the spring and summer 
this creates a seasonal peak in borrowing levels during the spring months 
we currently anticipate that no cash dividends will be paid on our common stock in order to conserve cash to fund our future operations and growth 
in addition  the terms of our credit facilities prohibit us from paying dividends

 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets apart from goodwill 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized but will be tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the goodwill test for impairment consists of a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step of the test is a screen for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
sfas no 
requires an entity to complete the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test within six months of adopting the statement 
we adopted sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 we identified two reporting units  the personal health care segment and the pool products and heating systems segment  which constitute components of our business that water pik technologies  inc include goodwill 
we completed the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test as of january  and the annual impairment test in fourth quarter and have determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded the reporting unit s carrying amount  and no impairment was indicated 
had the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
been adopted for all periods presented  our net income and net income per share for and would have increased  and  and  and  respectively

inflation inflation has not been a significant factor in the markets in which we operate and has not had a material impact upon our results of operations for the periods discussed above 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business  principally risk associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk operating in international markets sometimes involves exposure to volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on us is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales and related expenses  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
these changes  if material  may cause us to adjust its financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of international operations  primarily in canadian dollars and japanese yen  into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
such translation resulted in an unrealized gain of  in and unrealized losses of  in and  in we do not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
we do not enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings because we do not believe it is justified by the exposure or the cost 
the change in currency exchange rates for the canadian dollar would have the largest impact on translating future international operating profit 
we estimate that a percent change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on reported operating profit 
we believe that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  we do not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or financing and operating strategies 
interest rate risk we have borrowings outstanding of  at december   which bear interest at variable rates and  therefore  changes in interest rates affect interest expense incurred thereon 
the variable rate borrowings include our domestic and canadian lines of credit  the mortgages on its domestic facilities and the promissory notes issued under its equipment financing facility 
our domestic line of credit bears interest at prime plus to basis points  or at libor london interbank offered rate plus to basis points per annum 
our canadian line of credit bears interest at canadian or us prime rate plus basis points 
the mortgage notes bear interest at libor plus to basis points 
the promissory notes under the equipment financing facility bear interest at libor plus basis points 
in order to mitigate a portion of the market risk on its variable rate debt  we entered into interest rate swap contracts with a financial institution on january  under terms of these separate contracts we receive a libor based variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate of percent on the contracts on notional amounts totaling  at december  that mature in january we estimate that a percent change in interest rates would not have a material impact on reported operating profit
