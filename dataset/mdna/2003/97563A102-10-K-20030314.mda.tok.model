under the reit modernization act the rma  which became effective january   the company is permitted to lease its hotels to wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries  provided that the subsidiary lessees engage a third party management company to manage the hotels 
simultaneous with acquiring the leasehold interests  barclay entered into new management contracts with interstate for of the hotels covered by the leases 
these five year contracts are terminable by barclay after june   subject to certain conditions and limitations 
the company sold two of the hotels during the third and fourth quarters of and signed new management contracts for another two  one with sage client  llc  an affiliate of sage hospitality resources  llc sage and one with noble investment group  ltd  noble 
as of december   interstate managed of the company s hotels  interstate management and investment corporation imic headquartered in columbia  south carolina unrelated to and unaffiliated with interstate managed six hotels  concord hospitality enterprises company concord managed two hotels  and promus hotels  inc  an affiliate of hilton hotels corporation hilton  sage  and noble each managed one hotel

two of these hotels are leased to bristol w 
tenant company  a wholly owned subsidiary of six continents hotels  inc six continents  the las vegas  nv hampton inn and the windsor  ct hilton garden inn  and one is leased to secaucus holding corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of prime hospitality corp

under the terms of the leases  the lessees are obligated to pay the company the greater of base rent or percentage rent 
the leases are designed to allow the company to participate in the growth in revenues at the hotels by requiring that a portion of each hotel s room revenues in excess of specified amounts be paid to the company as percentage rent 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts and notes receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers  mezzanine loan borrowers  and other borrowers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of its customers  mezzanine loan borrowers  or other borrowers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
accounting for joint ventures the company has a ownership interest in three joint venture hotels and a ownership interest in two joint venture hotels 
the company has determined that it does not have a controlling interest in any of the joint ventures and therefore uses the equity method to recognize its share of net income or loss from the joint ventures and adjusts the carrying value of the investment accordingly 
the joint ventures assets  liabilities  and equity are not recorded on the company s balance sheet 
the company receives current financial information from the joint ventures and performs an analysis to determine its share of income 
this analysis includes the review of operational data  significant assets and liabilities  and results of operations to ensure that the company s interests are realizable 
the company considers  among other criteria  the operating trends and expectations for the foreseeable future 
the company believes that these joint venture operations presently support the carrying value of the investments in joint ventures 
if the operations of the joint ventures do not support such carrying values in the future  the company may have to write down its investment in joint ventures accordingly 
accounting for long lived assets the company evaluates the potential impairment of individual long lived assets  principally the hotel properties 
the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment in hotels has been impaired  such that future undiscounted cash flows  together with an anticipated liquidation amount  would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the hotel property 
the company considers many factors and makes certain assumptions when making this assessment  including but not limited to general market and economic conditions  operating results over the past several years  the performance of similar properties in the same market and expected future operating results based on a variety of assumptions 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in addition  if the company s assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and anticipated liquidation amounts are incorrect  a future impairment charge may be required 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance have been considered  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should our estimate of future taxable income be less than expected  or our tax planning strategy not be carried out as planned  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset in the period such determination was made 
results of operations due to the acquisition of the leasehold interests from interstate  the results of operations for the year ended december  versus the results of operations for the year ended december  does not result in a meaningful comparison 
this is due primarily to recording the operating results of the hotels  for which the leasehold interests were acquired  on the company s statements of operations beginning in the third quarter of the table below outlines the company s wholly owned hotel properties owned as of december   and the company made no acquisitions of hotels  other than through joint ventures  during the periods presented 
december  december  december  hotels sold properties hotels sold properties hotels sold properties during the owned at during the owned at during the owned at year year end year year end year year end type of hotel limited service hotels extended stay hotels full service hotels total the company adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
sab on january  sab requires that a lessor not recognize contingent rental income until the lessee has achieved annual specified hurdles 
sab effectively defers percentage lease revenue from the first and second quarters to the third and fourth quarters 
due to the acquisition of the leasehold interests from interstate  effective july   percentage lease payments made by barclay to the company for of the hotels which are wholly owned  are eliminated in consolidation 
therefore  during the third quarter of the company recognized deferred revenue totaling  which had accrued through june  for of the hotels that were wholly owned 
three of these hotels have since been sold 
the company continues to defer recognition of percentage lease revenue for the two wholly owned hotels  the las vegas  nv hampton inn and the secaucus  nj holiday inn  that continue to be operated under long term leases with six continents and prime  respectively 
sab will have no impact on the company s funds from operations ffo  or its interim or annual cash flow from its third party lessees  and therefore  on its ability to pay dividends 
the acquisition of the leasehold interests from interstate entitles barclay to retain the operating profits or losses from the related hotels  which previously accrued to interstate under the leases and gives the company i more control over the operations of these hotels  ii the benefits from any operating margin improvements and risk of any operating margin deterioration at these hotels  and iii more flexibility  in that these hotels are no longer encumbered by long term leases that are difficult to amend and expensive to terminate 
all of the hotels continue to operate under the same franchise affiliations as prior to the acquisition of the leasehold interests 
actual year ended december  versus actual year ended december  revenue rooms  food and beverage and other operating departments revenue the increase in hotel revenues is a result of the acquisition of the leasehold interests from interstate 
the operating results of the hotels  for which the leasehold interests were acquired  are reflected on the company s consolidated statements of operations beginning july  percentage lease revenue percentage lease revenue declined for the quarter and year to date 
this decline is primarily due to the acquisition of the leasehold interests from interstate for hotels 
upon acquisition of the leases  the company recognized  of deferred percentage lease revenue  which represented the deferred revenue accrued through june  for the wholly owned hotels 
effective july   the percentage lease revenue for these wholly owned hotels was received from barclay and eliminated in consolidation 
beginning july   this percentage lease revenue reflected only the percentage lease revenue for the two wholly owned hotels that remain under long term leases with third parties  including the secaucus  nj holiday inn and the las vegas  nv hampton inn 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased from  in to  in the decline is primarily due to a decrease of in third party development and purchasing fees 
expenses rooms  food and beverage  other operating departments expenses the increase in these hotel expenses is a result of the acquisition of the leasehold interests from interstate 
the operating results of the hotels  for which the leasehold interests were acquired  are reflected on the company s consolidated statements of operations beginning july  property operating costs  franchise costs  maintenance and repair costs and management fees the increase in these hotel expenses is a result of the acquisition of the leasehold interests from interstate 
the operating results of the hotels  for which the leasehold interests were acquired  are reflected on the company s consolidated statements of operations beginning july  real estate taxes and property and casualty insurance real estate taxes and property insurance costs decreased from  in to  in this decline is primarily due to a decrease in ground rent expense of as a result of lower room revenues at the corresponding hotel 
insurance expense increased as a result of higher premiums in real estate taxes remained fairly constant from year to year 
percentage lease expense beginning july   this expense represents the lease expense barclay  as lessee  pays to third party owners of two joint venture hotels  including the evanston  il hilton garden inn and the ponte vedra  fl hampton inn 
general and administrative general and administrative expense decreased from  in to  in the decrease was primarily attributable to lower expenses associated with mezzanine financing  acquisition and development activities in depreciation and amortization depreciation expense declined primarily due to the sale of four hotels during and one hotel during amortization expense remained relatively consistent with the prior year 
interest interest expense decreased from  in to  in this decrease was due to both a decline in weighted average interest rates  from in to in  as well as a decline in the weighted average outstanding debt balance from  to  the weighted average outstanding debt balance decreased primarily due to the sale of million shares of common stock in march and april  and the use of the net cash proceeds totaling  to reduce the then outstanding debt balance 
loss on sale of property the loss on sale of property in represents the loss experienced on the sale of the raleigh  nc comfort inn in june the net loss on sales of property in is reported as loss on sale of discontinued operations see discontinued operations below and note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
income tax benefit the income tax benefit is primarily a result of the cost of acquiring the leases from interstate which was expensed for financial reporting purposes and will be amortized over the lives of the leases for tax purposes 
the income tax benefit is also a result of the net loss experienced by barclay during equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries equity in income loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries increased from in to  in primarily due to the evanston hilton garden inn hotel being open for the entire year during and from july through december in discontinued operations the company sold the clearwater  fl comfort inn in may  the southern pines  nc hampton inn in august  the augusta  ga comfort inn in november and the chester  va hampton inn in december the net loss on these sales and the operating results of these properties are shown as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
lease acquisition as discussed above  effective july   the company  through barclay  acquired the leasehold interests for of its hotels from interstate 
the total consideration of approximately  as determined by the leasehold acquisition agreement  was based upon a  purchase price for the leasehold interests  adjusted in part for accrued interest and related expenses totaling  and approximately  of working capital 
the cost of the acquisition of the leasehold interests  including accrued interest and related expenses  but excluding the working capital acquired  totaled  this cost represents the cancellation of an executory contract and was expensed on june  in addition  a deferred tax benefit of  was recognized on june  resulting from the timing difference of the  payment for financial reporting purposes versus tax purposes 
the net effect of this transaction is a reduction in net income of  the primary reason for the reduction in net income from to due to the acquisition of the leasehold interests from interstate  the results of operations for the year ended december  versus the results of operations for the year ended december  does not result in a meaningful comparison 
this is due primarily to recording the operating results of the hotels  for which the leasehold interests were acquired  on the company s statements of operations beginning in the third quarter of therefore  in an effort to make a more meaningful comparison between periods  in addition to the comparison of actual results of operations for the year ended december  and  shown below is selected pro forma financial information for the years ended december  and  as if the acquisition of the leasehold interests from interstate occurred on january  this information is also shown as if the sales of hotel properties  which occurred during and  occurred on january  as well 
therefore  the selected pro forma financial information below is based on both the company s and interstate s historical results of operations  after giving effect to certain pro forma adjustments  for the wholly owned hotels as of december  the pro forma adjustments include the elimination of the transaction to acquire the leasehold interests from interstate and the percentage lease revenue applicable to the wholly owned hotels for which the leasehold interests were acquired  as well as adjustments to undistributed property operating expenses to remove management company corporate costs  to make adjustments to management fees to reflect the fee structure per the new management agreements  and to make resulting adjustments to the allocation of earnings to minority interests 
the unaudited pro forma financial information does not purport to be indicative of what the actual results of operations of the company would have been had the transaction occurred on the basis assumed above nor are they indicative of results of future operations 
the unaudited pro forma financial information is based upon available information and upon assumptions and estimates that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
selected unaudited pro forma financial information year ended december  versus year ended december  in thousands pro forma year ended december  revenue rooms other hotel revenue hotel operating expenses rooms and other operating expenses undistributed property operating expenses pro forma revenue room revenue room revenue decreased  to  for the year ended december  versus  for the year ended december  we believe this is attributable to a weak economy  which resulted in revenue per available room revpar decreasing from in to in average daily rate for the year declined from in to in  while occupancy rates increased slightly from to 
the decrease in revpar was partially offset by an increase of  in room revenue from the evanston  il hilton garden hotel that opened in july other hotel revenue other hotel revenue consists of food and beverage revenue and other operating departments revenue 
other hotel revenue declined from  in to  in this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in long distance telephone revenue as a result of the increased use of cellular phones by guests 
pro forma expenses as a percentage of total hotel revenue  hotel operating expenses increased for the year from in to in rooms and other operating expenses rooms and other operating expense increased  from  in to  in  primarily due to an increase in payroll costs  guest room supplies costs and complimentary food and beverage costs 
undistributed property operating expenses undistributed property operating expenses consist of general and administrative  sales and marketing  energy  repairs and maintenance  franchise fees  management fees and other costs 
undistributed property operating expenses increased  from  in to  in these increases are primarily due to increases in sales and marketing expenses  including additional personnel and higher dues and subscriptions and e commerce costs  as well as increases in repairs and maintenance expenses  including personnel and small equipment and tool costs 
these higher expenses were offset  in part  by a decrease of in franchise fees on a year to date basis due to lower room revenue 
year ended december  versus year ended december  the company had revenues of  in  consisting of  of percentage lease revenues and  of interest and other income 
percentage lease revenues decreased  in from  in this decrease was due primarily to a sharp decline in revpar during the last four months of as a result of a weakening economy accelerated by the terrorist attacks that occurred on september  in  revpar decreased from january through august  as occupancy declined  offset by an increase in the average daily rate of 
however  revpar decreased from september through december  including a revpar decline of in september 
during the last four months of  occupancy declined and the average daily rate declined 
percentage lease revenue also decreased due to the sale of two hotels during and one hotel during interest and other income increased to  in from  in this increase is due primarily to an increase in development and purchasing fees of and an increase of in interest income from mezzanine loans 
real estate taxes and property and casualty insurance expenses remained fairly constant  at  in as compared to  in real estate taxes increased due to increased rates and property values in while property insurance expense decreased due primarily to a lower number of claims made in in addition  ground lease expense decreased in as a result of lower room revenues at the corresponding hotel 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in this increase is due primarily to site acquisition expenses of  costs related to efforts to purchase the leasehold interests for of its hotels from meristar totaling  a decrease in capitalized costs totaling  and loan costs totaling the loan costs were expensed due to the inability to finalize a collateralized mortgage backed securities debt instrument as a result of the instability in the marketplace caused by the terrorist attacks on september  depreciation expense decreased to  in from  in  due primarily to the sale of two hotels during and one hotel during amortization expense increased slightly to in from in interest expense decreased  to  in from  in  due primarily to a decrease in the annual weighted average interest rate of from in to in and a decrease in weighted average borrowings from  in to  in equity in income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures increased from to as a result of the opening of two joint venture hotels late in and the opening of a third joint venture hotel in july liquidity and capital resources the company finances its operations from operating cash flow  which  during  was principally derived from percentage lease payments from the hotels for the period january  through june   and principally derived from the net operating cash flows from the operations of the hotels from july  through december  for the year ended december  and  cash flow provided by operating activities was  and  respectively  and ffo was  and  respectively 
the decline in cash flow provided by operations is primarily due to the total paid of approximately  to acquire the leasehold interests for hotels from interstate effective july  funds from operations ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  is net income loss determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures which are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
the company further adjusts ffo by subtracting preferred share distributions and income tax benefit  and adding lease acquisition expense and the change in deferred revenue during the period to eliminate the impact of staff accounting bulletin no 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity and as such the presentation of ffo by the company may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reporting companies 
ffo is not intended to represent cash flows for the period 
ffo has not been presented as an alternative to operating income  but as an indicator of operating performance  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
ffo is a supplemental industry wide measure of reit operating performance  the definition of which was first proposed by nareit in and clarified in  and in response to perceived drawbacks associated with net income under gaap as applied to reits 
since the introduction of the definition by nareit  the term has come to be widely used by reits 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  most industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical gaap cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
accordingly  the company believes ffo combined with the company s primary gaap presentations required by the securities and exchange commission helps improve our equity holders ability to understand our operating performance 
under federal income tax law provisions applicable to reits  the company is required to distribute at least of its taxable income to maintain its tax status as a reit

the company intends to fund cash distributions to shareholders out of cash flow from operating activities 
the company may incur  or cause the partnership to incur  indebtedness to meet its dividend policy or the distribution requirements imposed on the company under the internal revenue code including the requirement that a reit distribute to its shareholders annually at least of its taxable income to the extent that available capital and cash flow from the company s investments are insufficient to make such distributions 
in march and april  the company completed the sale of million shares of its common stock pursuant to an underwritten public offering led by raymond james associates  inc with bb t capital markets  a division of scott stringfellow  inc  the co manager of the offer

in addition  at the company s option  it has the right to acquire regent s interest in either joint venture at any time after months following the date the applicable hotel commenced operations or if regent fails to sell the applicable hotel following the company s rejection of an offer by regent to sell the company its interest in that joint venture 
during  the company received cash distributions from its joint ventures totaling  under the terms of the joint ventures  the company has provided property development and purchasing services and will continue to provide ongoing asset management services for additional fee income

such income earned during and totaled and  respectively 
under the terms of the operating agreement for each joint venture  the company must approve all major decisions  including refinancing or selling the respective hotels  making loans  changes in partners interests  entering into material contracts  and acquiring assets 
the company  however  does not have a controlling interest in any of its joint ventures 
as of december   the total assets of the joint ventures were  total liabilities were   of which represented long term debt  and total equity was  the company s share of the total assets  liabilities  long term debt and equity equated to    and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  the total revenue of the joint ventures was  and  and total expenses were  and  resulting in net income of  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   the unaudited financial statements of the joint ventures reflected aggregate cash flow provided by operating activities of  cash used in investing activities of  principally for hotel additions  and cash provided by financing activities of  principally in the form of loan proceeds and capital contributions less distributions to joint venture partners 
during  the company spent  or of the lessees room revenue  in connection with the renovation of its hotels and plans to spend approximately  during in connection with the company s acquisition of the leasehold interests for of its hotels from interstate on july   barclay became the franchisee under the franchise licenses for the respective hotels 
as a result of this change  the company has elected to incur additional capital expenditures during consistent with certain franchisor requirements  which accounts for most of the projected increase in these capital expenditures are funded from operating cash flow  and possibly from borrowings under the company s  line of credit the line  sources that are expected to be adequate to fund such capital requirements 
these capital expenditures are in addition to amounts spent on normal repairs and maintenance  which were approximately and of room revenues in and  respectively  and are paid by the lessees 
the company s net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december  totaled  this net use of cash was primarily due to the payments made to decrease the outstanding debt balance of the line by  payments of distributions to shareholders totaling  and the payments of distributions to the partnership s minority interest totaling this amount also includes principal payments totaling  related to the company s  fixed rate note 
these cash outflows were offset by cash received from the issuance of million common shares for net cash proceeds totaling  during each quarter in  the company paid cash dividends per common and preferred share of and  respectively  equating to and  respectively  on an annual basis 
in addition  on an annual basis  the company expects to have adequate cash flow from operations to fund its expected debt service  capital expenditures  and dividend obligations during on december   the company amended and restated its previous  line of credit with the same group of banks  led by wachovia bank  na fees paid in connection with the new financing facility totaled  the new  three year line of credit the line bears interest at rates from libor plus to  based on the company s consolidated debt leverage ratio 
the line is collateralized with of the company s hotels  with a net book value of  as of december  the company used the proceeds from the line to pay off the outstanding balances under the previous  line of credit 
during  the company reduced the outstanding balance under its line of credit by  from  to  the company s articles of incorporation limit its debt to of the cost of its investment in hotel properties 
the company s availability under the line totaled approximately  as of december  availability is calculated each quarter on a trailing twelve month basis based upon certain valuation criteria contained within the line 
the line requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios including maximum leverage  minimum interest coverage and minimum fixed charge coverage  as well as certain levels of unsecured and secured debt and tangible net worth  all of which the company was in compliance with as of december  the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our line of credit 
furthermore  our line of credit provides that any default under  or acceleration of  any of our other debt  any debt of winn limited partnership or any debt of our subsidiaries  including any default by our financing subsidiary under its fixed rate loan or otherwise  will constitute a default under the line of credit 
any of these defaults  if not waived  could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness under our line of credit 
if this occurs  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it  in which case we would not be able to make distributions to our shareholders 
the company had  in debt at december  that was subject to a fixed interest rate and fixed monthly payments with ge capital corporation 
this debt  a ten year loan with a year amortization period  carries an interest rate of 
all unpaid principal and interest are due on december  the ge capital loan is collateralized with of the company s current hotels with a net book value of  as of december  all of the company s wholly owned hotels have been pledged as collateral for the company s debt securities  against the outstanding balance under the line and against the outstanding balance under the ge capital loan 
on december   the company completed an interest rate swap on  of its outstanding variable rate debt under the line 
this transaction effectively replaced the company s variable interest rate based on day libor on  of outstanding debt under the line with a fixed interest rate of until december   at which time the swap matured 
on january   the company completed an interest rate swap on  of its outstanding variable rate debt under the line 
this swap begins on march  and matures on february  this transaction effectively replaces the company s variable interest rate based on day libor on  of the line with a fixed interest rate of 
the line s interest rate spread is currently  equaling a fixed rate of on  from march  through february  in august  the company announced that its board of directors authorized the company to purchase up to  shares of its common stock 
in making the determination of whether or not to buy shares of common stock  management thoroughly analyzes the yield on such a buyback versus the yield from alternative uses of capital 
management also considers that when borrowing under the line to purchase common stock  the company s availability under the line is permanently reduced by the cost of the common stock purchased 
to date  the company has determined that a common stock buyback is not in the best interest of its shareholders 
as of december   the company s contractual obligations and commitments excluding obligations and commitments pursuant to the company s joint ventures were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years after years long term debt corporate office lease total contractual obligations other commercial commitments total year years years after years line of credit the company intends to continue to seek additional mezzanine loan opportunities  as well as other loan opportunities in general  and to acquire and develop additional hotel properties that meet its investment criteria 
the company is continually evaluating such opportunities  as well as other investment opportunities including  but not limited to  the acquisition of assets that require substantial renovation and repositioning within a particular market 
it is expected that future mezzanine loans and hotel acquisitions will be financed  in whole or in part  from additional follow on offerings  from borrowings under the line  from joint venture agreements  from the net sale proceeds of hotel properties and or from the issuance of other debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurances that the company will make any further mezzanine loans or any investment in additional hotel properties  or that any hotel development will be undertaken  or if commenced  that it will be completed on schedule or on budget 
furthermore  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to obtain any additional financing

it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee

fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
arb no 
 was issued in january this interpretation clarifies the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin also addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  which have one or both of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity 
the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest a 
the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  b 
the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  which makes it possible for the entity to finance its activities  or c 
the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur  which is the compensation for the risk of absorbing the expected losses 
this interpretation is intended to achieve more consistent application of consolidation policies to variable interest entities and  thus  to improve comparability between enterprises engaged in similar activities even if some of those activities are conducted through variable interest entities 
including the assets  liabilities  and results of activities of variable interest entities in the consolidated financial statements of their primary beneficiaries will provide more complete information about the resources  obligations  risks  and opportunities of the consolidated enterprise 
disclosures about variable interest entities in which an enterprise has a significant variable interest but does not consolidate will help financial statement users assess the enterprise s risks 
this interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the company is in the process of evaluating the provisions of fin and its effect on the joint ventures as disclosed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality the hotels operations historically have been seasonal in nature  reflecting higher occupancy during the second and third quarters 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating profits 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenue  the company expects to utilize cash on hand or borrowings under the line of credit to make distributions to the equity holders 
forward looking statements this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
you can identify these statements by use of words like guidance  project  target  may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  believes  continue or similar expressions 
these statements represent the company s judgment and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual operating results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements  including but not limited to the following risks changes in general economic conditions  properties held for sale will not sell  financing risks including the inability to obtain financing on favorable terms  if at all  development risks including the risks of construction delays and cost overruns  lower than expected occupancy and average daily rates  non issuance or delay of issuance of governmental permits  zoning restrictions  the increase of development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion  non payment of mezzanine loans  the failure to make additional mezzanine debt investments and investments in distressed hotel assets  failure to attract joint venture opportunities and other risk factors described below under the heading risk factors 
risk factors risks relating to our business our ability to make distributions to our shareholders depends upon the ability of our hotel managers and lessees to operate our hotels effectively 
in order to qualify as a reit  we cannot operate any hotel  or directly participate in the decisions affecting the daily operations of any hotel 
either our third party managers under management agreements  or our third party lessees  have direct control of the daily operations of our hotels 
under the reit modernization act of the rma  which became effective january   reits are permitted to lease their hotels to wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries of the reits trs lessees 
even under the rma  trs lessees may not operate the leased hotels and must enter into management agreements with eligible independent contractors that will manage the hotels 
we do not have the authority to directly control any particular aspect of the daily operations of any hotel eg  setting room rates 
thus  even if we believe our hotels are being operated in an inefficient or sub optimal manner  we may not be able to require a change to the method of operation 
our only alternative for changing the operation of our hotels may be to replace the third party manager of one or more hotels in situations where the applicable management agreement permits us to terminate the existing manager 
as a result of the company s acquisition through its trs lessee of the leasehold interests for of its hotels  effective july   the operating income loss of these hotels was recorded on the company s financial statements 
our income primarily depends upon the net operating income of our hotels 
our ability to make distributions to our shareholders depends on the ability of our hotel managers to generate sufficient revenues from our hotels in excess of operating expenses 
our managers will be affected by factors beyond their control  such as changes in the level of demand for rooms and related services of our hotels  their ability to maintain and increase gross revenues and operating margins at our hotels  and other factors 
as of december   of our hotels were managed by interstate 
therefore  any operating difficulties or other factors specifically affecting interstate s ability to maintain and increase gross revenues and operating margins at our hotels could significantly adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our growth strategy contemplates additional hotel acquisitions that meet our investment criteria and selective development of hotels as market conditions warrant 
our ability to grow depends  in part  upon the ability of our third party managers to manage our current and future hotels effectively 
if the third party managers are not able to operate additional hotels at current staffing levels and office locations  they may need to hire additional personnel  engage additional third party managers and or operate in new geographic locations 
if the third party managers fail to operate the hotels effectively  our ability to generate income from the hotels could be adversely affected 
the events of september   as well as the weak us economic recovery  have adversely impacted the hotel industry generally  and we have experienced an adverse effect on our results of operations 
prior to september   our hotels had begun experiencing declining revenue per available room  or revpar  as a result of the slowing us economy 
the terrorist attacks of september  and more recent concerns about possible additional terrorist attacks  combined with the effects of the resulting recession and weak economic recovery  have led to a substantial reduction in business and leisure travel throughout the united states  and industry revpar generally  and revpar at our hotels specifically  has declined substantially since september while revpar at our hotels has improved from the depressed levels in the weeks immediately following the events of september  revpar at our hotels remains below pre september levels and may remain at such depressed levels 
we cannot predict the extent to which the events of september  subsequent concerns about possible additional terrorist attacks  and the weak economic recovery will continue to directly or indirectly impact the hotel industry or our operating results in the future 
continued depressed revpar at our hotels which we expect in the near term could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  including our ability to remain in compliance with the covenants contained in our debt instruments  our ability to fund capital improvements and renovations at our hotels and our ability to make dividend payments necessary to maintain our reit tax status 
additional terrorist attacks could have further material adverse effects on the hotel industry and our operations 
we may not have access to financing for acquiring or developing additional hotels 
our ability to pursue our growth strategy depends  in part  on our ability to finance additional hotel acquisitions and development 
we may not be able to fund growth solely from cash provided from operating activities because we must distribute at least of our taxable income each year to maintain our tax status as a reit and normally distribute in order to avoid paying corporate income tax and excise tax on undistributed income 
consequently  we rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund hotel acquisitions and improvements 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting sufficient debt or equity financing at an acceptable cost to fund future growth 
we are subject to restrictions that may limit our ability to take advantage of expansion opportunities that we believe are attractive 
our existing million line of credit limits our borrowing availability to a percentage of the value of the hotels provided as collateral  with the value determined in part by the cash flow generated by those hotels 
as a result  as of december   we had approximately million available for borrowing under our line of credit  of which million was outstanding 
if we need to borrow funds under the line of credit in excess of our current borrowing availability  we must provide additional collateral  which may not be available  to increase our borrowing availability to the total amount of debt we need  up to a maximum amount million 
as of december  all wholly owned hotels had been pledged as collateral for our debt facilities  against the line of credit and against the ge capital cmbs loan 
in addition  our articles of incorporation limit our debt to of the cost of our investment in hotel properties  or approximately million as of december  our ability to raise additional equity capital will depend on market conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise funds through a public or private offering at a time when we need access to funds 
we may seek alternative methods of funding expansion  such as joint venture development  however  we cannot assure you that such opportunities will be available when we need them or on acceptable terms 
we have a significant level of debt that may limit our ability to take certain actions 
we currently have a significant amount of debt 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our line of credit and winston spe  llc  a special purpose financing subsidiary of winn limited partnership a partnership of which we are the sole general partner  had million outstanding under a fixed rate loan 
as of december   the total liabilities of our joint ventures were million million of which represented long term debt 
our proportionate share of such total liabilities and long term debt equated to million and million  respectively 
our level of debt could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could impair our ability to obtain additional financing  if needed  for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes in the future  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing our funds available for operations  future business opportunities and other purposes  place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt  restrict our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions  and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic  industry and business conditions 
if we or our financing subsidiary do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt at maturity  it may be necessary for us to refinance our debt through additional debt financing  private or public offerings of debt securities or additional equity offerings 
if  at the time of any refinancing  prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on refinancings  increases in interest expense could adversely affect our cash flow and  consequently  cash available for distribution to shareholders 
if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms  we or our financing subsidiary may be forced to dispose of hotels or other assets on disadvantageous terms  potentially resulting in losses and adverse effects on cash flow from operating activities 
if we are unable to make required payments of principal and interest on debt secured by our hotels  one or more of those properties could be foreclosed upon by the lender with a consequent loss of revenue and asset value 
the covenants governing our debt impose significant restrictions on us 
the terms of our line of credit impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and require us to meet certain financial tests  including leverage ratios  maximum unsecured and secured debt ratios  interest and fixed charge coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth requirements 
these restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions  including incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness  paying dividends in excess of of our funds from operations over the most recent four quarters  making capital expenditures and other investments  creating liens on our assets  and engaging in mergers  consolidations or the sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets 
the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our line of credit 
furthermore  our line of credit provides that any default under  or acceleration of  any of our other debt  any debt of winn limited partnership or any debt of our subsidiaries  including any default by our financing subsidiary under its fixed rate loan or otherwise  will constitute a default under the line of credit 
any of these defaults  if not waived  could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness under our line of credit 
if this occurs  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it  in which case we would not be able to make distributions to our shareholders 
even if new financing were available  it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
if our cash flow decreases  we may be required to provide additional collateral under our line of credit or take other actions that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we have pledged hotel properties as collateral to secure the line of credit and our financing subsidiary has pledged hotel properties to secure the fixed rate loan  which accounts for all of the company s wholly owned hotels 
both loan agreements prohibit pledging any hotel pledged as collateral under that facility to secure other debt 
our line of credit limits our borrowing availability to a percentage of value of the hotels provided as collateral  with the value determined in part by the cash flow generated by those hotels 
our current cash flow from the hotels securing the line of credit limits our borrowing availability under the line of credit  which as of december   was million 
if we need to borrow funds under the line of credit in excess of our borrowing availability  we must provide additional collateral to increase our borrowing availability to the total amount of debt we need  but not to exceed million 
if our cash flow decreases to such a level that our borrowing availability is less than the amount outstanding under the line of credit  we must either repay the excess of the amounts outstanding over our borrowing availability or with the unanimous consent of the lenders  provide additional collateral to increase our borrowing availability 
if we were unable to repay the excess debt over our borrowing availability or provide additional collateral  the resulting payment default would entitle our lenders to exercise one or more remedies  including foreclosing on one or more of the properties pledged as collateral 
rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow 
our borrowings under our line of credit bear interest at a variable rate 
our line of credit requires that we maintain at least of our total debt at a fixed rate of interest 
although we have entered into agreements that limit our interest rate exposure on a portion of the outstanding debt under our line of credit  outstanding debt of up to million under our line of credit remains subject to variable interest rates 
we may incur debt in the future that bears interest at a variable rate or we may be required to refinance our existing debt at higher interest rates 
accordingly  increases in interest rates could increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow 
we may not be able to complete development of new hotels on time or within budget 
we intend to develop additional hotel properties as suitable opportunities arise 
new project development is subject to a number of risks that could cause increased costs or delays in our ability to generate revenue from any development hotel  reducing our cash available for distribution to shareholders 
these risks include construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs  competition for suitable development sites  receipt of zoning  land use  building  construction  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations  and substantial development costs in connection with projects that are not completed 
we may not be able to complete the development of any projects we begin and  if completed  our development and construction activities may not be completed in a timely manner or within budget 
we also intend to rehabilitate hotels that we believe are underperforming 
these rehabilitation projects will be subject to the same risks as development projects 
hotels that we develop have no operating history and may not achieve levels of occupancy that result in levels of operating income that provide us with an attractive return on our investment 
the new hotels that we develop have no operating history 
these hotels may not achieve anticipated levels of occupancy  average daily room rates  or gross operating margins 
similarly  during the start up period  room revenues may be less than required to result in the operating income levels that provide us with an attractive return on our investment 
property ownership through joint ventures and partnerships could limit our control of those investments 
joint ventures or partnerships other than winn limited partnership involve risks not otherwise present for investments we make on our own 
it is possible that our co venturers or partners may have different interests or goals than we do at any time and that they may take actions contrary to our requests  policies or objectives  including our policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a reit 
other risks of joint venture investment include impasses on decisions  because no single co venturer or partner has full control over the joint venture or partnership 
each of our venture partners for our existing joint venture properties has the right  after the first twelve months of the hotel s operation  to sell the hotel developed by the joint venture to us  or  if we elect not to purchase  to sell such hotel to a third party 
in addition  future joint ventures may include other restrictions on us  including requirements that we provide the joint venture with the right of first offer or right of first refusal to acquire any new property we consider acquiring directly 
our business could be disrupted if we need to find a new manager upon termination of an existing management agreement 
if our managers fail to materially comply with the terms of their management agreements  we have the right to terminate such management agreements 
upon termination  we would have to find another manager to manage the property 
we cannot operate the hotels directly due to federal income tax restrictions 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to find another manager or that  if another manager were found  we would be able to enter into new management agreements favorable to us 
there would be disruption during any change of hotel management that could adversely affect our operating results 
if we decide to sell hotels  we may not be able to sell those hotels on favorable terms and may be required to pay termination fees to the lessees of those hotels 
we have sold five hotels during the past two years  one in and four in although none of our other hotels is currently under contract to sell  we may decide to sell additional hotels in the future 
we may not be able to sell such hotels on favorable terms  and such hotels may be sold at a loss 
as with acquisitions  we face competition for buyers of our hotel properties 
other sellers of hotels may have the financial resources to dispose of their hotels on unfavorable terms that we would be unable to accept 
if we cannot find buyers for any properties that are designated for sale  we will not be able to implement our divestiture strategy 
in the event that we cannot fully execute our divestiture strategy or realize the benefits therefrom  we will not be able to fully execute our growth strategy 
furthermore  under management agreements for six of our hotels  and under our three leases with third party lessees  two of which are for wholly owned hotels and one of which is for a joint venture hotel upon the occurrence of certain events  we must either pay a termination fee or offer another suitable property for management or lease  as the case may be 
the amount of the termination fee depends upon certain calculations 
alternatively  we may negotiate to waive the provision and arrange for the manager or lessee to continue to manage the property for the buyer or lease the property from the buyer  as the case may be 
if we were not able to successfully negotiate such a continuation  we would be required to pay a termination fee  substitute another suitable property or abandon the sale transaction 
we may face conflicts of interest relating to sales of hotels acquired from affiliates 
we have acquired hotels in the past from related parties of our affiliates  which include robert winston  our chief executive officer  and charles winston  our chairman of the board 
the limited partners of winn limited partnership  including robert winston and charles winston  may have unrealized gain associated with their interests in these hotels 
our sale of any of those hotels may cause adverse tax consequences to the limited partners 
therefore  our interests could conflict with the interests of the limited partners in connection with the disposition of one or more of those hotels  including limited partners who may be board members or otherwise in a position to exert influence over other board members who will determine whether we sell these hotels 
we depend on key personnel 
we depend on the efforts and expertise of our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief accounting officer and executive vice president of development to drive our day to day operations and strategic business direction 
the loss of any of their services could have an adverse effect on our operations 
our ability to replace key individuals may be difficult because of the limited number of individuals with the breadth of skills and experience needed to excel in the hotel industry 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to hire  train  retain or motivate such individuals 
our borrowers may fail to repay all or a portion of the mezzanine loans owed to us 
we face special risks in connection with our mezzanine loans to borrowers for the purpose of building and owning hotels 
we are subject to risks of borrower defaults  bankruptcies  fraud and losses and special hazard losses that are not covered by standard hazard insurance 
we expect that each mezzanine loan will be made to a single purpose entity whose sole asset would be a hotel being built or renovated 
our present mezzanine loans are not  and we do not expect that any of our future mezzanine loans will be  collateralized by the hotel being built by the single purpose entity 
mezzanine loans will be subordinate to any debt collateralized by the hotel being built and maybe any other debt of the single purpose entity 
mezzanine loans involve a higher degree of risk than long term senior mortgage lending that is secured by income producing real property for a variety of reasons including  among other things  dependency on the success of a project which a third party controls and that a foreclosure by the holder of the senior loan could result in a mezzanine loan becoming uncollectible 
additionally  mezzanine loans may have higher loan to value ratios than conventional term loans 
the borrowers may not be able to repay their obligations under their senior loans or our mezzanine loans  in which case we could suffer a total or partial loss on our mezzanine loans 
in  we wrote off as uncollectible our participation interest in a  mezzanine loan to the owner of a room resort hotel in orlando  fl  and other existing or future borrowers may become in default on our mezzanine loans 
mezzanine lending risks 
a mezzanine lender has some of the same risks as a traditional real estate lender  such as lender liability for improperly exercising control over the borrower and environmental risks as a potentially responsible party liable for environmental damage in connection with the property owned by the borrower 
a mezzanine lender may enhance these risks by pursuing remedies on default that afford greater control over the operations of the borrower  especially if the mezzanine lender exercises its authority as a managing or co managing member 
courts have discretion to decline to enforce loan features which purport to limit or modify a mortgagor s right to redeem real estate after a mortgage default and before foreclosure by paying off the loan  and thus some remedies specified in our mezzanine loans may be unavailable to us 
in addition a borrower may allege that being in the position to control the borrowing entity creates duties by the lender to the borrower  including fiduciary like duties that may conflict with the lender s actions to exercise its remedies 
finally  to be able to protect its mezzanine loan  a mezzanine lender may have to advance additional funds to cure defaults on senior loans 
if third parties for whom we develop hotels default on their loans  we may be required to complete the development of those hotels at our own expense 
in certain cases where we are offering third party hotel development services in exchange for fees  we may elect to provide the hotel owner developer with a construction completion guaranty on the particular hotel under development 
in those cases  if the owner developer were in default under the terms and conditions of its senior loans  its senior lenders might seek to compel us to complete the development of the particular hotel with our own funds  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to our industry our performance and the value of our stock are subject to risks associated with the hotel industry 
our hotels are subject to operating risks of the hotel industry that could reduce our revenue and ability to make distributions to shareholders 
our hotels are subject to all operating risks common to the hotel industry 
these factors could adversely affect the ability of our hotels to generate operating income and therefore affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
these risks include  but are not limited to competition for guests from other hotels  many of which have substantial marketing and financial resources  faster growth in room supply than in room demand growth in our markets  increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors which may not be offset in the future by increased room rates  seasonality  with higher hotel revenues occurring in the second and third calendar quarters  increases in energy costs  airline fares and other expenses related to travel  which may deter traveling  terrorist incidents  which may also deter traveling  adverse effects of general and local economic conditions  a general inability to control costs  thereby resulting in lower gross operating profit  and risks generally associated with the ownership of hotels and real estate  as discussed below 
our entire business is concentrated in particular segments of a single industry 
our entire business is hotel related 
our investment strategy is to acquire additional hotels  or ownership interests in hotels  with strong national franchise affiliations in the mid scale without food and beverage  upscale  and full service market segments  or hotel properties with the potential to obtain such franchise affiliations 
therefore  a downturn in the hotel industry  in general  and the segments in which we operate  in particular  will have a material adverse effect on our income and the amounts available for distribution to our equity holders 
large scale military deployments may adversely impact the occupancy rates and revenues from our two hotels located in communities that have a large military population 
currently  we own two hotels located in communities with a large military presence  one near fort bragg in fayetteville  north carolina and one near camp lejeune in jacksonville  north carolina 
during the persian gulf war in the early s  a large number of military personnel deployed to the persian gulf and  additionally  their respective families departed those communities for the duration of the military member s deployment 
the two local communities suffered economic loss as a result 
if a large number of military personnel were deployed away from their permanent duty stations for an extended period  we expect that occupancy rates and revpar at those two hotels would be adversely affected 
we may incur higher costs as a result of the proximity of our hotels to the coast 
several of our hotels are located near the atlantic ocean and are exposed to more severe weather than hotels located inland 
these hotels are also exposed to salt water and humidity  which can increase or accelerate wear on the hotels weatherproofing and mechanical  electrical and other systems 
as a result  we may incur additional expenditures for capital improvements 
our hotel concentration in the southeastern united states subjects us to operating risks 
at december   out of our wholly owned hotels were located in the five eastern seaboard states ranging from virginia to florida  including hotels located in north carolina 
adverse events in these areas  such as economic recessions  hurricanes or other natural disasters  could cause a loss of revenues from these hotels  which could have a greater adverse effect on us as a result of our concentration of assets in this area 
our geographic concentration also exposes us to risks of oversupply and competition in our principal markets 
each of our hotels competes with other hotels in its market area 
a number of additional hotel rooms will continue to be built in the markets in which our hotels are located  which could result in too many hotel rooms in those regions 
significant increases in the supply of hotel rooms without corresponding increases in demand can have a severe adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
conditions of franchise agreements could adversely affect us 
all of our hotels are operated pursuant to franchise agreements with nationally recognized hotel brands 
in addition  hotels in which we subsequently invest may be operated pursuant to franchise agreements 
a hotel s failure to adhere to the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement could result in the loss or cancellation of its franchise license 
we rely on our managers and third party lessees to conform to such franchisor standards 
the franchise agreements generally contain specific standards for  and restrictions and limitations on  the operation and maintenance of a hotel in order to maintain uniformity within the franchisor s system 
these standards are subject to change over time  in some cases at the discretion of the franchisor  and may restrict our ability to make improvements or modifications to a hotel without the consent of the franchisor 
in addition  compliance with these standards could require us to incur significant expenses or capital expenditures 
our cash available for distribution could be adversely affected if we or our lessees must incur substantial costs to maintain a franchise license 
if a franchise license terminates due to our lessee s failure to make required improvements or to otherwise comply with its terms  our lessee may be liable to the franchisor for a termination payment 
these termination payments would vary by franchise agreement and by hotel 
the loss of a substantial number of franchise licenses and the related termination payments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   of the hotels franchise licenses  including four joint venture hotels  eight expire in the next five years  two in  two in  and four in in connection with termination of a franchise license or changing the franchise affiliation of a hotel  we may have to incur significant expenses or capital expenditures 
moreover  the loss of a franchise license  in the event that it could not be renewed or is otherwise lost  could have a material adverse effect on the operations or the underlying value of the hotel covered by the franchise because of the loss of association  name recognition  marketing support and centralized reservation system provided by the franchisor 
any of these events could have a negative effect on our ability to make distributions to shareholders 
the franchise agreements covering the hotels expire or terminate  without special renewal rights  at various times and have different remaining terms 
operating costs and capital expenditures could adversely affect our cash flow 
hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements  particularly in older structures  including periodic replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
under the terms of our leases  we are obligated to pay the cost of certain capital expenditures at the hotels and to pay for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
franchisors also may require periodic capital improvements to our hotels as a condition of retaining the franchise licenses 
in addition  we intend to invest selectively in hotels that require significant renovation 
renovation of hotels involves certain risks  including the possibility of environmental problems  construction cost overruns and delays  uncertainties as to market demand or deterioration in market demand after commencement of renovation  and the emergence of unanticipated competition from other hotels  and displacement of room revenues due to rooms being out of order 
if any of these costs exceed our estimates  the additional costs could have an adverse effect on our cash available for distribution 
we must compete with larger entities for acquisition and franchising opportunities 
we compete for acquisition opportunities with entities that have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
these entities generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage  including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a hotel operator or the geographic proximity of its investments  and may have better relations with franchisors 
competition may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us and increase the bargaining power of sellers 
in addition  other potential buyers who do not need to use a lessee or a third party operator to operate the hotel may be able to offer a higher price for a property than we are able to pay 
our performance and value are subject to the condition of the real estate industry 
we may not be able to sell hotels when appropriate 
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly 
we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic and other conditions 
because we are a reit  federal income tax laws limit our ability to sell properties in some situations when it may be economically advantageous to do so 
as a result  returns to our shareholders could be adversely affected 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the market value of any of our hotels will not decrease in the future  and therefore we may not be able to sell our hotels on favorable terms 
liability for environmental matters could adversely affect our financial condition 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of investigation and removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under  originating at or in the property  including fixtures  structures and other improvements located on the property 
these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or should have known of  or caused  the presence of contaminants 
although phase i environmental site assessments esas were obtained on all of the hotels  the phase i esas did not include invasive procedures  such as soil sampling or ground water analysis 
while the phase i esa reports have not revealed any environmental condition  liability or compliance concern that the company believes would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  assets or results of operations  it is possible that these reports do not reveal all environmental conditions  liabilities or compliance concerns or that there are material environmental conditions  liabilities or compliance concerns that arose at a hotel after the related phase i esa report was completed of which the company is unaware 
the costs to clean up a contaminated property  to defend against a claim  or to comply with environmental laws could be material and could affect the funds available for distributions to equity holders 
clean up costs and the owner s or operator s liability generally are not limited under these laws and could exceed the value of the property and or the aggregate assets of the owner or operator 
in addition  the presence of  or failure to properly remediate  contaminants may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent the property or borrow using the real property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the clean up costs of the substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not the facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person 
environmental  health and safety laws and common law principles also govern the presence  effects  maintenance and removal of hazardous substances  including asbestos containing materials  or acms 
asbestos has been found in two of our hotels and asbestos or other hazardous substances may be found in other hotels we own or acquire in the future 
many such laws permit third parties  including employees and independent contractors  to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances  including acms 
in connection with the ownership of the hotels  we may be considered an owner or operator and therefore may be potentially liable for any such costs  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
black mold claims could adversely affect our financial condition 
recent publicity regarding families abandoning their homes because of the presence of stachyhotrys chartarum black mold has raised public consciousness regarding black mold 
black mold is a greenish black fungus found worldwide that grows in such places as dry wall  carpet  wall paper  fiber board  ceiling tiles  and thermal insulation when the relative humidity is above 
while the scientific community lacks consensus on the health threat  if any  posed by exposure to black mold  if black mold is detected in any of our hotels  we may be subject to adverse publicity  which could adversely affect our operations and financial results from that hotel 
such claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or pay significant damages 
in addition  we may be required to close all or portions of the affected hotel during mold remediation operations  generally consisting of a thorough cleaning with chlorine bleach and water 
under certain conditions  black mold may be difficult to eradicate and require us to remove and replace moldy materials in the hotel 
in extreme cases  it may be necessary to perform extensive facility repairs 
the presence of black mold in any hotel also could adversely impact the carrying value of that hotel 
during  the company invested in the beachwood  oh courtyard by marriott hotel  which is currently owned by wcc project company llc 
the company s current ownership interest in this hotel is 
prior to making its initial investment  the company knew that black mold existed at the hotel and engaged consultants with expertise in black mold remediation and performed extensive research to satisfy itself that the black mold condition could be eradicated through renovation and repair procedures 
following the completion of such remediation procedures  the company believes that all of the black mold has been removed from this hotel  which is expected to open for business in april because black mold is a naturally occurring fungus  the spores of which can be transported by outside air currents  there can be no assurances that black mold will not again enter and grow in this hotel or that it will not be found in the company s other hotel properties 
liability for uninsured and underinsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in the event of a substantial loss  our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment 
certain types of losses  such as mold  terrorist acts  earthquakes  floods  hurricanes  and other acts of god  may be uninsurable or not economically insurable 
in addition  we may not be able to use insurance proceeds to replace a damaged or destroyed property as a result of changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations or other factors 
in these circumstances  any insurance proceeds we receive might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to the damaged or destroyed property and we would be required to seek separate financing for repair and replacement costs  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all  or face a loss on our investment 
the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and other changes in governmental rules and regulations could adversely affect our cash flow 
under the americans with disabilities act of  or the ada  all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
a determination that we are not in compliance with the ada could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
in addition  other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the use and operation of the hotels could change  including changes to building codes and fire and life safety codes 
if we are required to spend money to comply with the ada or other changes in governmental rules and regulations  our ability to make distributions to shareholders could be adversely affected 
increases in property taxes could adversely affect our cash flow 
real and personal property taxes on our current and future hotel properties may increase as property tax rates change and as the properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities 
an increase in property taxes could have an adverse effect on our ability to make distributions to shareholders 
risks relating to capital stock the price of our securities may be affected by changes in market interest rates 
one of the factors that may influence the price of our common stock or preferred stock in public trading markets is the annual yield from distributions on our common stock or preferred stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments 
thus  an increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or preferred stock 
shareholder approval is required to change certain policies  limiting the ability of our board of directors to take certain actions in response to changing conditions 
we cannot change our policy of limiting consolidated debt to of the cost of our investment in hotel properties without shareholder approval 
in addition  the approval of the holders of two thirds of our shares of common stock entitled to vote is necessary to change our policy of seeking to maintain qualification as a reit 
as a result  our board of directors could not change either of these policies without first receiving shareholder approval at an annual or special meeting  even if the change in policy would be advantageous to us 
the ability of our shareholders to effect a change in control is limited 
stock ownership limitations could inhibit changes in control 
our articles of incorporation provide that no shareholder may own  directly or indirectly  more than of any class of our outstanding stock 
this limitation may have the effect of precluding an acquisition of control by a third party without the approval of our board of directors even if a change in control were in your best interest 
our ability to issue preferred stock could inhibit changes in control 
our articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares of preferred stock issued 
currently  there are  shares of preferred stock outstanding 
issuing additional preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control even if a change in control were in our shareholders interest 
risks relating to reit status we are subject to tax risks as a result of our reit status 
we have operated and intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
our continued qualification as a reit will depend on our continuing ability to meet various requirements concerning the ownership of our outstanding stock  the nature of our assets  the sources of our income  and the amount of distributions to our shareholders 
in order to qualify as a reit  we generally are required each year to distribute to our shareholders at least of our taxable income  other than any net capital gain and any taxable income of our trs lessees 
to the extent that we meet the distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be required to pay income tax on our undistributed income 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount we pay out to our shareholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the federal tax laws 
any taxable income of our trs lessees will incur corporate income tax  but will not be subject to any distribution requirement 
the requirement to distribute a substantial portion of our net taxable income could cause us to distribute amounts that otherwise would be spent on future acquisitions  unanticipated capital expenditures or repayment of debt  which would require us to borrow funds or to sell assets to fund the costs of such items 
we have made  and intend to continue to make  distributions to our shareholders to comply with the current distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
our income consists of our share of the income of winn limited partnership  and our cash available for distribution consists of our share of cash distributions from winn limited partnership  less capital expenditures and principal debt payments 
differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the receipt of cash available for distribution due to the seasonality of the hotel industry could require us to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the distribution requirement and to avoid income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
if we were to fail to qualify as a reit for any taxable year  we would not be allowed to deduct our distributions to our shareholders in computing our taxable income 
furthermore  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
unless we are entitled to relief under the federal income tax laws  we also would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost our qualification 
as a result  our cash available for distribution would be reduced for each of the years involved 
although we currently operate and intend to continue to operate in a manner designed to qualify as a reit  it is possible that future economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may cause our board of directors  with the consent of shareholders holding at least two thirds of the common stock entitled to vote  to revoke the reit election 
at any time  the federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended 
any of those new laws or interpretations thereof may take effect retroactively and could adversely affect the company or its shareholders 
on january   the bush administration released a proposal that would exclude corporate dividends from an individual s taxable income  to the extent that corporate income tax has been paid on the earnings from which the dividends are paid 
reit dividends would not be exempt from income tax in the hands of an individual shareholder because reits income generally is not subject to corporate level tax 
this proposal could cause stock in non reit corporations to be a more attractive investment to individual investors than stock in reits 
there can be no assurance regarding the form in which this proposal ultimately will be enacted or whether it will in fact be enacted

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in thousands as of december   the company s exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates related solely to debt outstanding under the line

the definitive extent of the company s interest rate risk under the line is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
if interest rates increased by basis points  the company s annual interest expense would have increased by approximately  based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding and exposed to fluctuations in the market rate of interest at december  the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes
