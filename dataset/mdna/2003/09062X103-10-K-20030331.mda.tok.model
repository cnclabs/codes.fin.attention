the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are primarily engaged in the research  development  manufacture and commercialization of targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
in february  zevalin became the first radioimmunotherapy approved by the fda for the treatment of certain b cell nhls 
we have retained all united states marketing and distribution rights to zevalin and have granted marketing and distribution rights outside the united states to schering ag 
in january  the emea accepted for filing the zevalin maa  submitted by schering ag in the european union 
in march  the summary of product characteristics was approved by the european cpmp for the treatment of adult patients with rituximab relapsed or refractory cd follicular b cell nhl 
in july  we announced that marketing approval in europe and european launch of zevalin would be delayed 
the cpmp s final approval is pending approval of our manufacturing facilities and fill finish provider by the emea 
our other product  rituxan  is being copromoted in the united states under a joint business arrangement with genentech  where we receive a share of the pretax copromotion profits 
under the copromotion arrangement  we share responsibility with genentech for selling and continued development of rituxan in the united states 
continued development of rituxan includes conducting supportive research on rituxan  post approval clinical studies and obtaining approval of rituxan for potential additional indications 
genentech provides the support functions for the commercialization of rituxan in the united states including marketing  customer service  order entry  distribution  shipping and billing 
since september  genentech has been responsible for all worldwide manufacturing of rituxan 
under the terms of separate agreements with genentech  commercialization of rituxan outside the united states is the responsibility of roche  except in japan where it copromotes rituxan in collaboration with zenyaku 
we receive royalties on rituxan sales outside the united states 
our revenues include revenues from product sales of zevalin  revenues from unconsolidated joint business arrangement and corporate partner revenues 
since the commercialization of rituxan in november  our revenues have depended primarily upon the sale of rituxan 
we have incurred increasing annual operating expenses and  with the commercialization of rituxan and zevalin  we expect these trends to continue 
since our inception in  through  we incurred annual operating losses 
our ongoing profitability will be dependent upon the continued commercial success of rituxan  the commercial success of zevalin  product development and revenues from the achievement of product development objectives and licensing transactions 
as of december   we had retained earnings of million 
critical accounting principles and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and related allowances  inventory allowances  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  valuation of long lived assets and investments  and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most subjective judgments 
we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition and related allowances revenues from sales of zevalin are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer 
we record allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable  product returns and medicaid rebates at the time of sale 
our estimates for uncollectible accounts receivable  product returns and medicaid rebates are based primarily on our experience with zevalin to date  historical experience with rituxan and other factors  updated for changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
if actual results vary  we may need to adjust our estimates  which could have an impact on earnings in the period of adjustment 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business arrangement consist of our share of the pretax copromotion profits generated from our copromotion arrangement with genentech  reimbursement from genentech of our rituxan related sales force and development expenses and royalty revenue from sales of rituximab outside the united states by roche and zenyaku 
under the copromotion arrangement  all us sales of rituxan and associated costs and expenses are recognized by genentech and we record our share of the pretax copromotion profits on a quarterly basis  as defined in our collaborative agreement with genentech 
pretax copromotion profits under the copromotion arrangement are derived by taking us net sales of rituxan to third party customers less cost of sales  third party royalty expenses  distribution  selling and marketing expenses and joint development expenses incurred by genentech and us 
our profit sharing formula with genentech has two tiers  we earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profits at the upper tier once a fixed pretax copromotion profit level is met 
the profit sharing formula resets annually at the beginning of each year to the lower tier 
we record our royalty revenue with a one quarter lag 
corporate partner revenues  which consist of contract revenues and license fees  are recognized in accordance with the provisions of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab no 
revenue is not recognized unless collectibility is reasonably assured and the earnings process is complete 
we believe our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with sab no 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in performing this assessment  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
our estimates of future taxable income are derived from  among other items  our estimates of future deductions related to stock options 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined by the first in  first out method  or market 
if inventory costs were to exceed expected market value due to excess  obsolescence or unmarketability  we would record allowances for the difference between the cost and the market value 
we have not recorded any such allowances as of december  included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of clinical products which are recorded to research and development expense when consumed 
pre launch production of zevalin antibodies manufactured prior to fda approval in february were recognized as research and development expenses 
results of operations product sales product sales consist solely of sales of zevalin  our radioimmunotherapy product which was approved by the fda for the treatment of certain b cell nhls in february cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was and primarily consists of contractual royalties owed on zevalin sales 
pre launch production of zevalin antibodies manufactured prior to fda approval in february were recognized as research and development expenses 
zevalin sales to date have solely consisted of zevalin antibodies produced prior to fda approval in february had pre launch production of zevalin antibodies been recorded as inventory  cost of sales as a percentage of product sales would have been approximately 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business arrangement revenues from unconsolidated joint business arrangement for the years ended december   and  consist of the following table in thousands copromotion profits    bulk rituxan sales  reimbursement of selling and development expenses   royalty revenue on sales of rituximab outside the us  including royalties received directly from roche    under our agreement with genentech  our pretax copromotion profit sharing formula has two tiers 
we earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profits at the upper tier once a fixed pretax copromotion profit level is met 
the profit sharing formula resets annually at the beginning of each year to the lower tier 
we began recording our profit share at the higher percentage during the first quarter of both and compared to the beginning of the second quarter of rituxan net sales to third party customers in the united states recorded by genentech for amounted to billion compared to million in and million in the increase in and was primarily due to increased market penetration in treatments of b cell nhls and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and increases in the wholesale price of rituxan effective march  march and may our royalty revenue on sales of rituximab outside the us is based on roche and zenyaku s end user sales and is recorded with a one quarter lag 
the increase in royalty revenues in is due to higher sales of rituxan outside the us resulting from increased penetration of foreign markets  including initial sales of rituxan in canada and japan 
corporate partner revenues corporate partner revenues totaled million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in corporate partner revenues in is primarily due to decreased research and development funding in under our collaborations with taisho  resulting from the termination of our collaboration with taisho in  and mitsubishi  partially offset by increased research and development funding under our collaboration with seikagaku 
additionally  in  we recognized a million payment received from schering ag when the emea accepted for filing the submission of a maa for approval of zevalin in europe and million of revenues resulting from the implementation of sab no 
the decrease in corporate partner revenues in resulted primarily from decreased research and development funding under our collaborations with schering ag and taisho  partially offset by increased research and development funding under our collaboration with mitsubishi and a million milestone payment received under our collaboration with eisai 
contract revenues and license fees are  in part  dependent upon the achievement of certain research and development and commercialization objectives and  accordingly  may vary from year to year 
manufacturing costs manufacturing costs recorded in are related to the production of bulk rituxan sold to genentech and were recognized when genentech accepted the bulk rituxan inventory 
no manufacturing costs were recorded in and due to the transfer of all worldwide manufacturing responsibilities for bulk rituxan to genentech in september the final lots of bulk rituxan manufactured by us during the third quarter of were accepted by genentech during the first quarter of since the transfer of all worldwide manufacturing responsibilities for bulk rituxan to genentech  and prior to receiving fda approval for zevalin in february  we used our manufacturing capacity for production of specification setting lots and commercial inventory of zevalin antibodies and production of other proteins for clinical trials 
those manufacturing expenses were recorded as research and development expenses 
research and development expenses research and development expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in research and development expenses in is primarily due to upfront fees incurred under new collaborations  one time license fees incurred for technology rights related to our products  increased personnel expenses and expansion of our facilities to support our ongoing basic research and clinical development programs  partially offset by capitalization of manufacturing costs for the production of commercial inventory of zevalin antibodies and decreased clinical testing and development costs for zevalin as a result of the fda s approval of zevalin 
the increase in research and development expenses in is primarily due to increased clinical testing of our various products under development  development costs for zevalin  personnel expenses and expansion of our facilities 
our zevalin bulk inventory levels at december  are expected to be adequate to support zevalin sales in as such  we do not anticipate manufacturing zevalin bulk inventory in in  our manufacturing facilities will be primarily used to support products in development which will cause the majority of the costs of our manufacturing operations to be recorded as research and development expense in such costs were capitalized into inventory in to the extent they related to the manufacture of zevalin 
in the future we expect to continue incurring substantial additional research and development expenses due to preclinical and clinical testing of our various products under development  the expansion or addition of research and development programs  technology in licensing  regulatory related expenses  the expansion of clinical manufacturing capabilities  and facilities expansion 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in selling  general and administrative expenses in increased primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses related to the commercial launch of zevalin  sales expenses to support the commercialization of rituxan  increased legal fees to protect our intellectual property rights for zevalin and increases in general and administrative expenses to support overall organizational growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to increased marketing and administrative expenses related to the commercialization of zevalin  sales expenses to support rituxan  legal expenses to defend zevalin patent issues and general increases in general and administrative expenses to support overall organizational growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the foreseeable future to support the following marketing and administration related to the commercialization of zevalin  manufacturing capacity expansion  clinical trials  research and development  and protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights for zevalin and our product candidates 
interest income expense interest income totaled million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in interest income in is primarily due to significantly lower interest rates earned on our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale  partially offset by higher cash balances from the issuance of our senior convertible promissory notes due  or senior notes  in april and may the increase in interest income in is primarily due to higher average balances in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale resulting from the sale of million shares of our common stock in november  cash provided by operations and cash provided from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and purchase plans 
the average yields earned on our investments in decreased from the average yields earned on our investments in as a result of declining market interest rates 
interest income levels to be achieved in the future are  in part  dependent upon market conditions 
interest expense totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in interest expense in is due to noncash interest expense from our senior notes issued in april and may  partially offset by the capitalization of million of interest costs related to the development of our corporate headquarters and research and development campus in san diego  california and our large scale manufacturing facility in oceanside  california 
the increase in interest expense in is primarily due to noncash interest from our subordinated convertible promissory notes due  or subordinated notes  issued in february income tax provision our effective tax rate in was approximately compared to percent in and in our effective tax rates for and were less than a normal statutory rate due primarily to the generation of tax credits by our research and development activities 
we have net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes available to offset future taxable income 
the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation under the internal revenue code due to a cumulative change of ownership of more than in prior years 
however  we anticipate this annual limitation to result only in a slight deferral in the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
during  we decreased our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to zero as  based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates of future taxable income or we adjust our estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we expect that our effective tax rate in the future will be slightly higher than levels achieved in but continue to be lower than a normal statutory rate as a result of our continued research and development efforts which we expect to generate tax credits 
cumulative effect of accounting change in the fourth quarter of  we implemented sab no 
 which became effective as of january  sab no 
provides that nonrefundable up front fees received under collaborative agreements be recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as revenue over future periods 
prior to the implementation of sab no 
 we recognized certain nonrefundable up front fees as revenue upon receipt 
the cumulative effect of this accounting change on years prior to resulted in a charge of million  net of a million income tax effect  of which million and million was recognized as license fee revenue in and  respectively 
this accounting change was directly related to the million up front license fee received from schering ag that was initially recognized as license fee revenue in  prior to the implementation of sab no 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operating and capital expenditures since inception principally through sales of equity securities  profits from our joint business arrangement related to the sale of rituxan  corporate partner revenues  lease financing transactions  debt financing transactions and interest income 
we expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through cash on hand  which includes the proceeds from the april and may issuance of our senior notes  funds from our joint business arrangement  funds from commercial sales of zevalin and funds from existing collaborative agreements and contracts 
we believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
existing collaborative research agreements and contracts  however  could be canceled by the contracting parties 
in addition  we may  from time to time  seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements  strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources 
additional funds may not be obtainable through these sources on acceptable terms if at all 
if adequate funds are not obtainable from our joint business arrangement  commercial sales of zevalin  operations or additional sources of financing  our business could be harmed 
our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the continued commercial success of rituxan  the commercial success of zevalin  timing and expense of obtaining regulatory approvals  funding and timing of payments related to several material capital projects  including the development of our large scale manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters and research and development campus  the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing  fluctuating or increasing manufacturing requirements and research and development programs  levels of resources that we devote to the development of manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities  including resources devoted to the marketing of zevalin  technological advances  status of competitors  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other organizations  and working capital required to satisfy the put options related to our senior notes 
until required for operations  we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  corporate notes  foreign and united states government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy 
at december   we had billion in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale compared to million at december  sources of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale during the year ended december  included million from the issuance of our senior notes in april and may  million provided by operations and million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock option and purchase plans 
uses of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale during the year ended december  included million used to fund construction projects and purchase property and capital equipment and million used for the repurchase of common stock for treasury 
in april and may  we raised through the issuance of our senior notes  approximately million  net of underwriting commissions and expenses of million 
simultaneously with the issuance of the senior notes  we used a portion of the proceeds to fund the repurchase of million of our outstanding common stock 
the senior notes are zero coupon and were priced with a yield to maturity of annually 
we will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of these senior notes during any nine month period commencing on or after april  if the average market price of the senior notes for a five trading day measurement period preceding such nine month period equals or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such senior note 
the contingent interest payable per senior note in respect of any quarterly period within such nine month period where contingent interest is determined to be payable will equal the greater of the amount of regular cash dividends paid by us per share on our common stock during that quarterly period multiplied by the then applicable conversion rate or of the average market price of a senior note for the five trading day measurement period preceding such nine month period  provided that if we do not pay regular cash dividends during a semiannual period  we will pay contingent interest semiannually at a rate of of the average market price of a senior note for the five trading day measurement period immediately preceding such nine month period 
upon maturity  the senior notes will have an aggregate principal face value of billion 
each  aggregate principal face value senior note is convertible at the holder s option at any time through maturity into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of 
in addition  holders of the senior notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the senior notes on april    and at a price equal to the issue price plus the accrued original issue discount to the date of purchase  payable at our option in cash  our common stock or a combination thereof 
in addition  if a change in control in our company occurs on or before april   holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their senior notes for cash 
we have the right to redeem all or a portion of the senior notes for cash at any time on or after april  at set prices 
we have an agreement with mds canada for the development and supply of the radioisotope yttrium used with our zevalin product 
under the terms of our agreement with mds canada  we are obligated to make periodic payments into an escrow account 
these funds secure certain obligations we have under the agreement regarding minimum annual purchases of yttrium and mds canada s establishment of a new facility to supply us with yttrium as of december   we have paid million into this escrow fund 
in september  we purchased approximately acres of land in san diego  california for approximately million in cash where we are building a corporate headquarters and research and development campus 
the first phase of construction is expected to be completed in mid at an estimated total cost of million which will be funded from our working capital 
as of december   we have invested approximately million in the construction of this campus 
in april  we purchased a building in oceanside  california to be used potentially for the manufacture of zevalin bulk antibody  drug supply for certain of our clinical trials and drug supply for any potential product launches prior to refurbishment of this facility was completed in the fourth quarter of at a total cost of approximately million which was funded with our working capital 
we are currently performing validation activities in this facility 
in september  we purchased a acre site in oceanside  california for approximately million in cash 
in december  we purchased an additional acres of land at the oceanside site for million in cash 
we are building a large scale manufacturing facility at this location  which we anticipate using to commercialize our products currently in clinical trials if they are approved by the fda 
this facility will allow us to better control the manufacture of our products  reducing our reliance on contract manufacturers  as well as reducing commercial supply risk 
we anticipate the first phase of the new facility to be mechanically completed in  followed by commissioning and validation in and total costs of this facility upon completion are estimated to be million which will be funded from our working capital 
as of december   we have invested approximately million in the construction of this large scale manufacturing facility 
in february  we raised through the issuance of our subordinated notes  approximately million  net of underwriting commissions and expenses of million 
the subordinated notes are zero coupon and were priced with a yield to maturity of annually 
upon maturity  the subordinated notes will have an aggregate principal face value of million 
each  aggregate principal face value subordinated note is convertible at the holders option at any time through maturity into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of 
we are required under the terms of the subordinated notes  following a change in control occurring on or before february   to purchase any subordinated note at the option of its holder at a price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of purchase 
additionally  the holders of the subordinated notes may require us to purchase the subordinated notes on february   or at a price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of purchase with us having the option to repay the subordinated notes plus accrued original issue discount in cash  our common stock or a combination thereof 
we have the right to redeem the subordinated notes on or after february  in connection with our research and development efforts  we have entered into various collaborative arrangements under which we may be obligated to pay royalties or milestone payments if product development is successful 
it is not anticipated that the aggregate of any royalty or milestone obligations under these arrangements will be material to our operations 
in january  we entered into a collaboration agreement with biogen  under which we will collaborate on the development of three oncology therapeutics from biogen s pipeline of early stage product candidates  including idec under the terms of this agreement  we will initially be responsible for the development costs of the product candidates  until that time  if any  when biogen exercises opt in rights with respect to each specific product candidate 
if biogen exercises its opt in rights for a specific product  we will share equally all subsequent costs and economic benefit related to that specific product with biogen 
if biogen chooses not to exercise its opt in rights  we will pay royalties to biogen for future sales  if any  of the specific products 
contractual obligations we had future minimum lease payment obligations under our operating leases totaling million as of december  other historically  we have not utilized off balance sheet arrangements or derivative financial instruments in our operating  investing and financing activities 
our transactions with our related parties  genentech  roche and zenyaku  are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or statement no 
statement no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
statement no 
requires that the initial measurement of a liability be at fair value 
the provisions of statement no 
generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  we cannot determine the potential effect that the adoption of statement no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements in the future 
in november  the eitf released issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
issue no 
addresses how to determine whether a revenue arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting for the purposes of revenue recognition and how the revenue arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 
issue no 
applies to all revenue arrangements that we enter into after june  the adoption of this statement is not currently anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
 or fin no 
fin no 
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of certain guarantees 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin no 
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin no 
are effective for interim or annual periods ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure provisions of fin no 
as of december  in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 or fin no 
fin no 
requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risk will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
fin no 
also requires enhanced disclosure requirements related to variable interest entities 
fin no 
applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we do not believe that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and the cost of our debt 
at december   we maintained a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
we also maintained an investment portfolio containing financial instruments in which the majority have maturities at purchase of greater than three months but less than months 
these financial instruments  principally comprised of corporate obligations and us government obligations  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates during the year ended december   would have resulted in approximately a million change in pretax income 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our long term debt totaled million at december  and was comprised solely of our senior notes which bear interest at a rate of and our subordinated notes which bear interest at a rate of 
these long term debt obligations bear interest at a weighed average interest rate of 
due to the fixed rate nature of our convertible promissory notes  an immediate ten percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we are also exposed to market risk in that an increase in our stock price or an increase in interest rates may make conversion of the convertible promissory notes to common stock beneficial to the convertible promissory notes holder 
conversion of the convertible promissory notes would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share and book value per common share
