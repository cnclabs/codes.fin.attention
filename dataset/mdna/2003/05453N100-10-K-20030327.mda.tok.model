item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  certain line items from our consolidated statements of operations stated as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  revenue product sales contract revenue royalties total revenue costs and expenses cost of product sales cost of contract revenue research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total costs and expenses income loss from operations interest income income loss before benefit from provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle benefit from provision for income taxes income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss product sales product sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware products and compression software 
hardware products primarily include adsl test and development systems  modules  and modems 
compression software consists of standard off the shelf software products that are sold to oem customers that integrate our software into their equipment based products 
product sales increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  product sales increased from in to in the dollar increase was primarily due to higher unit volume sales of modules and compression software  which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from the sale of test and development systems 
module sales were higher primarily due to sales to a customer that is using them in adsl test equipment 
compression software revenue increased primarily due to higher demand for our electronic identification products 
test and development system revenue decreased primarily due to lower demand from our semiconductor and equipment customers  which was the result of continued difficult economic conditions in the semiconductor and telecommunications industries 
product sales decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  product sales increased from in to in the dollar decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from the sale of test and development systems  which was partially offset by an increase in revenue from the sale of compression software 
test and development system revenue decreased primarily because our semiconductor and equipment customers curtailed product development activities beginning in as a result of difficult economic conditions in the semiconductor and telecommunications industries 
compression software revenue was higher due to a large sale of our electronic identification products in the first quarter of contract revenue contract revenue consists primarily of license and engineering service fees that we receive under agreements with our customers to develop adsl chipsets 
contract revenue decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  contract revenue increased from in to in contract revenue decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  contract revenue increased from in to in the dollar decreases in contract revenue in and were primarily due to a difficult environment for licensing intellectual property for communications integrated circuits 
both existing and prospective adsl chipset licensees were reluctant to begin new development projects given i generally weak worldwide economic conditions  ii a difficult and uncertain environment in the semiconductor and telecommunications industries  and iii intense adsl chipset competition and falling chipset prices 
during the last two years  customers and potential customers cautiously evaluated new chipset projects or delayed or cancelled projects in the face of such conditions 
we are uncertain when the economic and market conditions we faced in and will improve 
royalties royalties consist of royalty payments that we receive under licensing agreements 
we receive royalties from customers for the right to use our technology in their chipsets or solutions 
royalties decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  royalties decreased from in to in the decrease in royalties was primarily due to a decrease in adsl chipset sales by our largest customer  adi 
we believe that adi s chipset sales declined primarily due to falling adsl chipset pricing and a potential loss of market share 
despite strong growth of worldwide adsl subscribers in  the availability of adsl chipsets from a number of suppliers and intense competition among those suppliers has caused chipset prices to drop sharply over the last two years 
additionally  deployments of adsl service in geographic areas where chipsets based upon our technology have been sold  leveled off or declined in we are uncertain when adsl chipset pricing will improve  whether adi will be able to grow its presence or whether our other licensees will contribute meaningful royalty revenue 
royalties decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  royalties decreased from in to in the decrease in royalties was primarily due to a decrease in adsl chipset sales by adi  our largest customer 
we believe there were two principal factors behind the decline in adi s chipset sales in first  while end user demand for adsl service remains strong  particularly outside of the united states  more adsl chipsets were sold in than were required by new subscribers 
resulting equipment overcapacity at telephone companies central offices  and excess chipset inventory at adsl equipment manufacturers slowed industry wide chipset sales 
second  the glut of adsl chipsets and central office equipment capacity caused chipset selling prices to drop sharply 
cost of product sales since the cost of compression software license sales is minimal  cost of product sales consists primarily of adsl equipment sales 
cost of product sales increased from million in to million in as a percentage of product sales  cost of product sales increased from in to in the increase in cost of product sales was primarily due to a greater proportion of module sales in the sales mix 
modules have higher cost of sales than the other products that comprise our product revenue 
cost of product sales decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of product sales  cost of product sales decreased from in to in in terms of dollars  the decrease in cost of product sales was primarily due to lower sales of adsl test and development systems 
the improvement in product margins was primarily due to a greater proportion of compression software sales in the product sales revenue mix 
cost of contract revenue cost of contract revenue consists primarily of salaries for engineers and expenses for consultants  recruiting  supplies  equipment  depreciation and facilities associated with customer development projects 
our total engineering costs are allocated between cost of contract revenue and research and development expense 
in a given period  the allocation of engineering costs between cost of contract revenue and research and development is a function of the level of effort expended on each 
cost of contract revenue decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of contract revenue  cost of contract revenue decreased from in to in cost of contract revenue decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of contract revenue  cost of contract revenue increased from in to in the dollar decrease in cost of contract revenue in and was primarily due to fewer customer contracts 
since our cost of contract revenue is based on the level of effort we expend on customer projects and the number of customer projects declined in and  cost of contract revenue declined as well 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of salaries for engineers and expenses for consultants  recruiting  supplies  equipment  depreciation and facilities related to engineering projects to enhance and extend our broadband intellectual property offerings  and our compression software technology 
research and development expense increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expense increased from in to in the dollar increase in research and development spending was primarily due to the following factors i spending in includes the full year effect of a number of new engineers hired in spending in only reflects that portion of the year that these employees were employed by us  ii as the number of customer projects decreased over the past year  we shifted engineers who were working on these projects to internal research and development projects  and iii we incurred additional research and development spending in to design and manufacture an adsl adsl chip that we have named stratiphy 
our research and development spending is principally focused on projects related to core adsl technology  including our stratiphy chip  as well as for dr 
dsl  g 
shdsl  wireless local area network communications  and other development projects 
in october  we terminated employees to reduce our operating costs 
of the employees who were terminated  were engineers 
the cost of severance and other employee benefits for terminated employees was approximately  the cost was recorded in the fourth quarter of  and it approximates our historical quarterly costs for these employees as if they were active employees 
therefore  the reduction in force had a minimal effect on research and development spending in as of december   accrued severance costs were approximately  and are expected to be paid in the first half of in connection with the october reduction in force  we informed remaining employees that effective january  their salaries would be reduced by and that senior management s salaries would be reduced by 
we anticipate that the reduction in force and salary reductions will lower total engineering expenses by approximately million annually  and will lower total company expenses by million annually 
total engineering expenses include cost of contract revenue and research and development expense 
research and development expense increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expense increased from in to in the dollar increase was primarily due to increased spending on internal research and development projects  including improvements to our core adsl technology offering  projects such as vedsl  dr 
dsl  g 
shdsl  wireless local area network communications  powerline communications  as well as other development projects 
selling and marketing expense selling and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries for sales and marketing personnel  travel  advertising and promotion  recruiting  and facilities expense 
sales and marketing expense increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  sales and marketing expense increased from in to in the dollar increase was primarily due to increased spending on sales staff and higher commissions for product sales  which was partially offset by lower advertising and tradeshow expenses 
sales and marketing expense increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  sales and marketing expense increased from in to in the dollar increase was primarily due to the addition of sales and marketing staff during general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries for administrative personnel  facilities costs  and public company  bad debt  legal  and audit expenses 
general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expense increased from in to in the dollar increase was primarily due to higher provisions for bad debts 
in the fourth quarter of  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by million for an accounts receivable balance that we considered uncollectible 
general and administrative expense decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expense increased from in to in the dollar decrease was primarily due to lower provisions for bad debts  which was partially offset by increased spending on salaries 
interest income interest income decreased from million in to million in the dollar decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our cash balances and lower cash balances 
interest income decreased from million in to million in the dollar decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our cash balances 
income taxes we evaluate  on a quarterly basis  the positive and negative evidence affecting the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in  we determined that due to our continuing operating losses in and as well as the uncertainty of the timing of profitability in future periods  we should fully reserve our deferred tax assets 
as a result  we recorded a tax provision of million in to reserve for our remaining deferred tax assets 
we made no provision for income taxes in because we had a net loss 
in  we determined that based on our expected future profitability at that time  it was more likely than not that we would realize a portion of our tax assets 
accordingly  we recorded a deferred tax asset of million at december   which consisted of an income statement tax benefit of million for tax loss carryforwards and research and development credits  and an adjustment to additional paid in capital of million for stock option related deductions 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which begin to expire in  and federal research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million  which begin to expire in at december   we also had available state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which begin to expire in  and state research and development and investment tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  which begin to expire in of the total net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards for which a valuation allowance was recorded  approximately million is attributable to the exercise of stock options and the tax benefit will be credited to additional paid in capital  if realized in the future 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective january  we changed our method of revenue recognition in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
previously  we recognized contract revenue under multiple element agreements upon completion of contract milestones or upon transfer of intellectual property 
under the accounting method we adopted retroactive to january   we now recognize contract revenue under multiple element agreements by recording total license and engineering fees for the entire contract on a straight line basis over the estimated contract performance period  subject to the limitation that cumulative revenue through the end of any period may not exceed cumulative contract payments through that same period 
the cumulative effect of the change on prior years resulted in a charge to income of million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in revenue  respectively  that was included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of january  liquidity and capital resources since our inception in march  we have financed our activities primarily through the sale of stock 
in the years ended december   and  we received net proceeds from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans of million  million and million  respectively 
our operating activities used net cash of million in cash used in our operating activities was primarily the result of operating losses and working capital requirements 
operating activities provided net cash of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided by operations during was primarily due to the collection of accounts receivables  which was partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue 
cash provided by operations during was primarily due to our profitability in that year 
in the years ended december    and  we made capital expenditures of million  million  and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in all three years primarily consisted of spending on computer hardware and software  laboratory equipment  and furniture used principally in engineering activities 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and investments of million 
while we can not assure you that we will not require additional financing  or that such financing will be available to us  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  income taxes and the allowance for doubtful accounts to be critical policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from three sources i product revenue  which includes revenue from the sale of adsl equipment and compression software products  ii contract revenue  which includes license and engineering service fees that we receive under customer agreements  and iii royalties that we receive under customer contracts 
as prescribed by securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
we also apply the principles set forth in aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  when recognizing compression software revenue 
our revenue recognition policies are described more fully in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as described below  we make significant judgments and estimates during the process of determining revenue for any particular accounting period 
in determining revenue recognition  we assess whether fees associated with revenue transactions are fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we make a judgment whether fees are fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with that transaction 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
in addition to these general revenue recognition judgments  we make specific judgments and estimates with respect to the recognition of contract revenue 
we categorize customer contracts as either single element licensing agreements or multiple element licensing agreements 
contract revenue under single element licensing agreements is recognized when technology transfers have been delivered or when engineering services have been completed in accordance with defined milestones 
revenue recognized under single element agreements requires us to make judgments regarding the completeness of complex technology or service deliverables 
while our customer agreements generally do not contain customer acceptance provisions  we must make judgments that our deliverables have been made in accordance with the terms of underlying agreements 
contract revenue under multiple element licensing agreements is recognized by recording total license and engineering fees for the entire contract on a straight line basis over the estimated contract performance period  subject to the limitation that cumulative revenue through the end of any period may not exceed cumulative contract payments through that same period 
revenue recognized under multiple element agreements requires us to make estimates of contract performance periods 
the estimate of this period is subject to revision as the product is being developed under a contract  and a revision may result in an increase or decrease to the quarterly revenue for that contract 
revenue recognized under multiple element agreements also involves judgments regarding the completeness of contract milestones as described in the previous paragraph 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our actual current tax expense 
we must also estimate temporary and permanent differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense with the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets relate to net operating losses and research and development tax credits that we are carrying forward into future tax periods 
as of december   we had a total of million of deferred tax assets for which we had recorded a full valuation allowance 
of the total valuation allowance  approximately million relates to net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards that are attributable to the exercise of stock options and the tax benefit will be credited to additional paid in capital  if realized in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
if the judgments we make to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts do not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be required 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supercedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
eitf allowed for an exit cost liability to be recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also requires that liabilities recorded in connection with exit plans be initially measured at fair value 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early adoption encouraged 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for those companies who voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition and annual disclosure provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have not adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  and will continue to apply apb for our stock based compensation plans 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas in this form k  which is included in the summary of significant accounting policies footnote of our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
this interpretation also incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superseded 
the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for interim and annual periods ending after december  recognition and measurement provisions of fin become effective for guarantees issued or modified on or after january  we are currently assessing the impact of adopting the recognition and initial measurement provisions of this new interpretation 
in november  the eitf issued no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf issue no 
establishes three principles revenue should be recognized separately for separate units of accounting  revenue for a separate unit of accounting should be recognized only when the arrangement consideration is reliably measurable and the earnings process is substantially complete  and consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting in an arrangement based on their relative fair values 
eitf issue no 
is effective for all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently determining the impact  if any  eitf issue no 
will have on our financial position and results of operations 
factors that may affect future results some of the information in this form k contains forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  believe  estimate  continue and similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future operating results or financial condition  or state other forward looking information 
however  we may not be able to predict future events accurately 
the risk factors listed in this section  as well as any cautionary language in this form k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this form k could materially and adversely affect our business 
we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
our quarterly results are unpredictable and may fluctuate significantly 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
because our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict  and our expenses are largely independent of revenues in any particular period  it is difficult for us to accurately forecast revenues and profitability 
we generally recognize contract revenues ratably over the period during which we expect to provide engineering services 
while this means that contract revenues from current licenses are generally predictable  changes can be introduced by a reevaluation of the length of the development period  or by the termination of a contract 
the initial estimate of this period is subject to revision as the product being developed under a contract nears completion  and a revision may result in an increase or decrease to the quarterly revenue for that contract 
in addition  accurate prediction of revenues from new licensees is difficult because the development of a business relationship with a potential licensee is a lengthy process  frequently spanning a year or more  and the fiscal period in which a new license agreement will be entered into  if at all  and the financial terms of such an agreement are difficult to predict 
contract revenues also include fees for engineering services  which are dependent upon the varying level of assistance desired by licensees and  therefore  the revenue from these services is also difficult to predict 
it is also difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of royalty revenues 
royalties are recognized in the quarter in which we receive a report from a licensee regarding the shipment of licensed integrated circuits in the prior quarter  and are dependent upon fluctuating sales volumes and or prices of chips containing our technology  all of which are beyond our ability to control or assess in advance 
our business is subject to a variety of additional risks  which could materially adversely affect quarterly and annual operating results  including x market acceptance of our broadband technologies by semiconductor companies  x the extent and timing of new license transactions with semiconductor companies  x changes in our and our licensees development schedules and levels of expenditure on research and development  x the loss of a strategic relationship with a licensee  x equipment companies acceptance of integrated circuits produced by our licensees  x the loss by a licensee of a strategic relationship with an equipment company customer  x announcements or introductions of new technologies or products by us or our competitors  x delays or problems in the introduction or performance of enhancements or of future generations of our technology  x delays in the adoption of new industry standards or changes in market perception of the value of new or existing standards  x competitive pressures resulting in lower contract revenues or royalty rates  x personnel changes  particularly those involving engineering and technical personnel  x costs associated with protecting our intellectual property  x the potential that licensees could fail to make payments under their current contracts  x adsl market related issues  including o lower adsl chipset unit demand brought on by excess channel inventory  and o lower average selling prices for adsl chipsets as a result of market surpluses 
x regulatory developments  and x general economic trends and other factors 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenue levels and operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on our quarterly revenue and operating results to predict our future performance 
we have experienced net losses 
we had net losses in and we expect that we will have a net loss during the first quarter of we may continue to experience losses in the future if x the semiconductor and telecommunications markets do not recover from the downturn that began in  x our existing customers do not increase their revenues from sales of chipsets with our technology  or x new and existing customers do not choose to license our intellectual property for new chipset products 
we have a unique business model 
the success of our business model depends upon our ability to license our technology to semiconductor and equipment companies  and our customers willingness and ability to sell products that incorporate our technology so that we may receive significant royalties that are consistent with our plans and expectations 
we face numerous risks in successfully obtaining suitable licensees on terms consistent with our business model  including  among others x we must typically undergo a lengthy and expensive process of building a relationship with a potential licensee before there is any assurance of a license agreement with such party  x we must persuade semiconductor and equipment manufacturers with significant resources to rely on us for critical technology on an ongoing basis rather than trying to develop similar technology internally  x we must persuade potential licensees to bear development costs associated with our technology applications and to make the necessary investment to successfully produce chipsets and products using our technology  and x we must successfully transfer technical know how to licensees 
moreover  the success of our business model also depends on the receipt of royalties from licensees 
royalties from our licensees are often based on the selling prices of our licensees chipsets and products  over which we have little or no control 
we also have little or no control over our licensees promotional and marketing efforts 
our licensees are not required to pay us royalties unless they use our technology 
they are not prohibited from competing against us 
our business could be seriously harmed if x we cannot obtain suitable licensees  x our licensees fail to achieve significant sales of chipsets or products incorporating our technology  or x we otherwise fail to implement our business strategy successfully 
there has been and may continue to be an oversupply of adsl chipsets  which has caused our royalty revenue to decline 
the royalties we receive are influenced by many of the risks faced by the adsl market in general  including reduced average selling prices asps for adsl chipsets during periods of surplus 
since late  the adsl industry has experienced an oversupply of adsl chipsets and central office equipment 
excessive inventory levels led to soft chipset demand  which in turn led to declining asps 
as a result of the soft demand and declining asps for adsl chipsets  our royalty revenue has decreased substantially from the levels we achieved in price decreases for adsl chipsets  and the corresponding decreases in per unit royalties received by us  can be sudden and dramatic 
pricing pressures may continue during the first quarter of and beyond 
our royalty revenue may continue to decline 
we depend substantially upon a limited number of licensees 
there is a relatively limited number of semiconductor and equipment companies to which we can license our broadband technology in a manner consistent with our business model 
if we fail to maintain relationships with our current licensees or fail to establish a sufficient number of new licensee relationships  our business could be seriously harmed 
we are less certain than we have been in the past that one of our large customers  intel  will field adsl products based upon licensed technology from aware 
over the course of  our confidence that intel will be a large source of revenue for us in the near future has diminished 
in addition  our prospective customers may use their superior size and bargaining power to demand license terms that are unfavorable to us and prospective customers may not elect to license from us 
we derive a significant amount of revenue from one customer 
in and  we derived and  respectively of our total revenue from adi 
adi was the first customer to license adsl technology from us in  and their chipsets are the most mature implementations of our technology in the market 
our royalty revenues to date have been primarily due to sales of adi chipsets that use our adsl technology 
our royalty revenue in the near term is highly dependent upon adi s ability to maintain its market share and pricing 
the adsl market has experienced significant price erosion  which has adversely affected adi s adsl revenue  which in turn has adversely affected our royalty revenue 
to the extent that adi has lost market share  or loses market share in the future  or experiences further price erosion in its adsl chipsets  our royalty revenue could continue to decline 
our success requires acceptance of our technology by equipment companies 
due to our business strategy  our success is dependent on our ability to generate significant royalties from our licensing arrangements with semiconductor manufacturers 
our ability to generate significant royalties is materially affected by the willingness of equipment companies to purchase integrated circuits that incorporate our technology from our licensees 
there are other competitive solutions available for equipment companies seeking to offer broadband communications products 
we face the risk that equipment manufacturers will choose those alternative solutions 
generally  our ability to influence equipment companies decisions whether to purchase integrated circuits that incorporates our technology is limited 
we also face the risk that equipment companies that elect to use integrated circuits that incorporate our technology into their products will not compete successfully against other equipment companies 
many factors beyond our control could influence the success or failure of a particular equipment company that uses integrated circuits based on our technology  including x competition from other businesses in the same industry  x market acceptance of its products  x its engineering  sales and marketing  and management capabilities  x technical challenges of developing its products unrelated to our technology  and x its financial and other resources 
even if equipment companies incorporate our chipsets based on our intellectual property into their products  their products may not achieve commercial acceptance or result in significant royalties to us 
our success requires telephone companies to install adsl service in volume 
the success of our adsl licensing business depends upon telephone companies installing adsl service in significant volumes 
factors that affect the volume deployment of adsl service include x the desire of telephone companies to install adsl service  which is dependent on the development of a viable business model for adsl service  including the capability to market  sell  install and maintain the service  x the pricing of adsl services by telephone companies  x the quality of telephone companies networks  x government regulations  and x the willingness of residential telephone customers to demand adsl service in the face of competitive service offerings  such as cable modems 
if telephone companies do not install adsl service in significant volumes  or if telephone companies install adsl service based on other technology  our business will be seriously harmed 
our intellectual property is subject to limited protection 
because we are a technology provider  our ability to protect our intellectual property and to operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others is critical to our success 
we regard our technology as proprietary  and we have a number of patents and pending patent applications 
we also rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark law and non disclosure agreements to protect our unpatented intellectual property 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization 
as part of our licensing arrangements  we typically work closely with our semiconductor and equipment manufacturer licensees  many of whom are also our potential competitors  and provide them with proprietary know how necessary for their development of customized chipsets based on our adsl technology 
although our license agreements contain non disclosure provisions and other terms protecting our proprietary know how and technology rights  it is possible that  despite these precautions  some of our licensees might obtain from us proprietary information that they could use to compete with us in the marketplace 
although we intend to defend our intellectual property as necessary  the steps we have taken may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation 
in the future  we may choose to bring legal action to enforce our intellectual property rights 
any such litigation could be costly and time consuming for us  even if we were to prevail 
moreover  even if we are successful in protecting our proprietary information  our competitors may independently develop technologies substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
the misappropriation of our technology or the development of competitive technology could seriously harm our business 
our technology may infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
a large and increasing number of participants in the telecommunications industry have applied for or obtained patents 
some of these patent holders have demonstrated a readiness to commence litigation based on allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement 
third parties may assert patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business 
in the past  we have received claims from other companies that our technology infringes their patent rights 
intellectual property rights can be uncertain and can involve complex legal and factual questions 
we may infringe the proprietary rights of others  which could result in significant liability for us 
if we were found to have infringed any third party s patents  we could be subject to substantial damages and an injunction preventing us from conducting our business 
our business is subject to rapid technological change 
the semiconductor and telecommunications industries  as well as the market for high speed network access technologies  are characterized by rapid technological change  with new generations of products being introduced regularly and with ongoing evolutionary improvements 
we expect to depend on our adsl technology for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
therefore  we face risks that others could introduce competing technology that renders our adsl technology less desirable or obsolete 
also  the announcement of new technologies could cause our licensees or their customers to delay or defer entering into arrangements for the use of our existing technology 
either of these events could seriously harm our business 
we expect that our business will depend to a significant extent on our ability to introduce enhancements and new generations of our adsl technology as well as new technologies that keep pace with changes in the telecommunications and broadband industries and that achieve rapid market acceptance 
we must continually devote significant engineering resources to achieving technical innovations 
these innovations are complex and require long development cycles 
moreover  we may have to make substantial investments in technological innovations before we can determine their commercial viability 
we may lack sufficient financial resources to fund future development 
also  our licensees may decide not to share certain research and development costs with us 
revenue from technological innovations  even if successfully developed  may not be sufficient to recoup the costs of development 
one element of our business strategy is to assume the risks of technology development failure while reducing such risks for our licensees 
in the past  we have spent significant amounts on development projects that did not produce any marketable technologies or products  and we cannot assure you that it will not occur again 
we face intense competition from a wide range of competitors 
our success as an intellectual property supplier depends on the willingness and ability of semiconductor manufacturers to design  build and sell integrated circuits based on our intellectual property 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion  rapid technological change  short product life cycles  cyclical market patterns and increasing foreign and domestic competition 
as an intellectual property supplier to the semiconductor industry  we face intense competition from internal development teams within potential semiconductor customers 
we must convince potential licensees to license from us rather than develop technology internally 
furthermore  semiconductor customers  who have licensed our intellectual property  may choose to abandon joint development projects with us and develop chipsets themselves without using our technology 
in addition to competition from internal development teams  we compete against other independent suppliers of intellectual property 
we anticipate intense competition from suppliers of intellectual property for adsl and wireless local area networking 
the market for adsl chipsets is also intensely competitive 
our success within the adsl industry requires that adsl equipment manufacturers buy chipsets from our semiconductor licensees  and that telephone companies buy adsl equipment from those equipment manufacturers 
our customers chipsets compete with products from other vendors of standards based and adsl chipsets  including broadcom  centillium  conexant  globespanvirata  st  and ti 
adsl services offered over copper telephone networks also compete with alternative broadband transmission technologies that use the telephone network as well as other network architectures 
alternative technologies for the telephone network include symmetric high speed dsl also known as hdsl  sdsl and g 
shdsl  and very high speed dsl  also known as vdsl 
these dsl technologies are based on techniques other than those used by adsl to transport high speed data over telephone lines 
alternative technologies that use other network architectures to provide high speed data service include cable modems using cable networks  and wireless solutions using wireless networks 
these alternative broadband technologies may be more successful than adsl and we may not be able to participate in the markets involving these alternative technologies 
many of our current and prospective adsl licensees  as well as chipset competitors that compete with our semiconductor licensees  including broadcom  conexant  globespanvirata  st  and ti have significantly greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing and personnel resources than we do 
we may be unable to compete successfully  and competitive pressures could seriously harm our business 
our recent reduction in workforce may adversely affect the morale and performance of our personnel  our ability to hire new personnel and our operations 
in october  as part of an effort to reduce operating expenses  we terminated employees  which constituted approximately percent of our workforce 
as a result of that workforce reduction  we have incurred costs related to severance and other employee related costs 
our workforce reduction may also subject us to litigation risks and expenses 
in addition  our restructuring plan may yield unanticipated consequences  such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce 
as a result of these reductions  our ability to respond to unexpected challenges may be impaired  and we may be unable to take advantage of new opportunities 
further  the reduction in force may reduce employee morale and may create concern among existing employees about job security  which may lead to increased attrition or turnover 
as a result of these factors  our remaining personnel may decide to seek employment with more established companies  and we may have difficulty attracting new personnel that we might wish to hire in the future 
our stock price may be extremely volatile 
volatility in our stock price may negatively affect the price you may receive for your shares of common stock and increases the risk that we could be the subject of costly securities litigation 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and could continue to fluctuate based on a variety of factors  including x quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  x changes in future financial guidance that we may provide to investors and public market analysts  x changes in our relationships with our licensees  x announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our licensees or our competitors  x changes in adsl market growth rates as well as investor perceptions regarding the investment opportunity that companies participating in the adsl industry afford them  x changes in earnings estimates by public market analysts  x key personnel losses  x sales of common stock  and x developments or announcements with respect to industry standards  patents or proprietary rights 
in addition  the equity markets have experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies and that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our business may be affected by government regulations 
the extensive regulation of the telecommunications industry by federal  state and foreign regulatory agencies  including the federal communications commission  and various state public utility and service commissions  could affect us through the effects of such regulation on our licensees and their customers 
in addition  our business may also be affected by the imposition of certain tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on components that our customers obtain from non domestic suppliers or by the imposition of export restrictions on products sold internationally and incorporating our technology 
changes in current or future laws or regulations  in the united states or elsewhere  could seriously harm affect our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  and the effect that changes in interest rates would have on that portfolio 
our investment portfolio includes x cash and cash equivalents  which consist of financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less  and x investments  which consist of financial instruments that meet the high quality standards specified in our investment policy 
this policy dictates that all instruments mature in years or less  and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  and type of instrument 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we had invested million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments that matured in twelve months or less 
due to the short duration of these financial instruments  we do not expect that an increase in interest rates would result in any material loss to our investment portfolio 
as of december   we had invested million in long term investments that matured in one to three years 
these long term securities are invested in high quality corporate securities and us government securities 
despite the high quality of these securities  they may be subject to interest rate risk 
this means that if interest rates increase  the principal amount of our investment would probably decline 
a large increase in interest rates may cause a material loss to our long term investments 
the following table dollars in thousands presents hypothetical changes in the fair value of our long term investments at december  the modeling technique measures the change in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates
