item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview m wave is a value added service provider of high performance circuit boards used in a variety of digital and high frequency application for telecommunications and industrial electronics applications 
m wave s business has been particularly challenging for the past year  due to the downturn in the telecommunication industry and the resulting decline in customer demand 
was a year of transition for m wave as we have seen most of our business move from the telecommunications industry to the industrial electronics industry 
although the industrial electronics industry has also experienced a downturn  this transition has allowed us to broaden our base of customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities  and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate and update our estimates and judgments  including those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable  realizability of inventories  impairment of long lived assets  and amount of warranty obligations 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among other policies  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable the company recognizes revenue upon the shipment of its products to the customer provided that the company has received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  product returns are reasonably estimable  collection of resulting receivable is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
we maintain an allowance for estimated product returns based on historical experience 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this estimate is based on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions and the profile or our customer mix 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions were to be less favorable than we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include significant decline in operating results relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of assets  changes in technology or significant negative or economic trends 
if this review indicates that the value of an asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the asset will be reduced to the fair value and the remaining depreciation period may be adjusted 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of the product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the warranty obligation includes a provision based on historical experience  as well as reserves for specific issues we identify 
to the extent actual warranty charges vary from our historical experience  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
other other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies relating to fair value of financial instruments  depreciation  and income taxes require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board  securities and exchange commission  etc 
although no specific conclusions reached by these authorities appear likely to cause a material change in the company s accounting policies  outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence 
also see note to the company s consolidated financial statements  which provide a summary of the company s significant accounting policies

there can be no assurances that the company s operations and access to external sources of financing will continue to provide resources sufficient to service the company s indebtedness after satisfying liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business 
dependence on major customers the company s three largest customers accounted for of the company s net sales in the company expects that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial majority of its sales and that the relative dollar amount and mix of products sold to any of these customers can change significantly from year to year 
there can be no assurance that the company s major customers will continue to purchase products from the company at current levels  or that the mix of products purchased will be in the same ratio

competition ability to respond to technical advances the company s future success is highly dependent upon its ability to manufacture products that incorporate new technology and are priced competitively

this competitive environment has resulted in downward pressure on gross margins 
in addition  the company s business has evolved towards the production of relatively smaller quantities of more complex products  the company expects that it will at times encounter difficulty in maintaining its past yield standards 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop technologically advanced products or that future pricing actions by the company and its competitors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
dependence on overseas manufactures the company is dependent upon unaffiliated foreign companies for the manufacture of printed circuit boards as part of its virtual manufacturing process 
the company s arrangements with manufacturers are subject to the risks of doing business abroad  such as import duties  trade restrictions  production delays due to unavailability of parts or components  transportation delays  work stoppages  foreign currency fluctuations  political instability and other factors which could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that the loss of any one or more of its suppliers would not have a long term material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations because other manufacturers would be able to increase production to fulfill its requirements 
however  the loss of certain suppliers  could  in the short term adversely affect its business until alternative supply arrangements were secured
