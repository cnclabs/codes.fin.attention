item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those encompassed within such forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth herein under the caption additional factors that may affect future performance 
general for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our results during the past three fiscal years  you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted a revised fiscal calendar 
previously  each fiscal year began june and ended may with interim quarters ending the last calendar day of every third month 
under our new fiscal calendar  the fiscal year begins on the saturday closest to june  except for fiscal which began friday  june  and ends on the friday closest to may interim quarters typically consist of thirteen weeks ending the friday closest to the last calendar day of august  november  and february 
because the revised fiscal calendar differs only slightly from the previous calendar  the change created no significant differences in operating results or financial position between periods in this report 
unless otherwise noted  all references in this report to a particular year mean our fiscal year 
ndchealth is a leading provider of health information services that add value to the pharmacy  hospital  physician  pharmaceutical and payer businesses 
until fiscal  ndchealth  formerly known as national data corporation  provided both health information and electronic payment services 
on january   global payments inc was spun off to our stockholders 
during fiscal and we closed a number of locations  consolidated numerous clearinghouses  reduced overhead expenditures  rationalized our product lines  divested several operations and discontinued our management services business 
since the spin off of global payments  we have operated solely as a network based healthcare information company 
business position and strategy there are three key elements to our strategy  to increase revenue per claim through value added transactions  to grow claims volume as healthcare grows and through gains in market share  and to take full advantage of our extensive claims processing resources in our information management business and to be well positioned for a rebound in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry 
the united states government estimates that of the trillion spent on healthcare in the us  is spent on administration and inappropriate care 
we believe we play an important role in providing automation  transaction processing and information solutions to improve the efficiency and efficacy of healthcare 
our strategy starts with the fundamental transaction in healthcare s revenue cycle the submission of claims from providers to third party payers 
we estimate that we process approximately of these electronic healthcare claims in the united states 
our revenue increases as we gain market share and provide advanced edit processing and other value added products and services to the claims in real time to add significant customer value 
we are able to price incrementally for each of these additional products and services in addition to the pricing for the base claim 
further  due to an aging population and increasing automation in healthcare  the claims volume grows  also increasing revenue 
from our network  we capture the claim and related transaction information  combine that information with data we purchase  and create information solutions for pharmaceutical manufacturers and providers  such as pharmacies 
our information strategy is to continue to aggregate and integrate data from our processing network to create unique new products which build additional streams of revenue and expand margins 
we also have an international expansion strategy to further leverage our proven business model 
today  we provide products and services to four major areas of the healthcare industry 
table of contents pharmacies retail  mail order  internet based and specialty hospitals physicians pharmaceutical manufacturers by aggregating and integrating data from the three provider markets we increasingly create unique business insights for pharmaceutical manufacturers  or pharma 
our goal  as healthcare evolves  is to also expand our customer base to include payers  employers and consumers while reducing the effective cost per unit of data 
building blocks the first and central building block of our business is being the primary information service company for the three major components of the pharmacy industry s technology infrastructure 
for pharmacies  we provide systems that optimize the prescription fulfillment process  the labor intensive element of the pharmacy business  provide a value added claims processing and real time editing network that we believe has the highest performance  quality and integrity in processing claims to third party payers and provide the data warehouse analytical capabilities that can produce unique business management insights to pharmacy customers 
we believe we are the only company capable of integrating all three of these pharmacy technology functions to optimize our customers business models 
in the financial and administrative areas we add value applications as diverse as workflow efficiency  pricing  product substitution  regulatory compliance and loss prevention 
in the area of workflow efficiency for example  our solutions permit the prescription fulfillment process to allow parallel rather than sequential processing 
this allows multiple specialists  often at different locations  to contribute to filling the prescription  resulting in a requirement for fewer pharmacists  currently in scarce supply  and greater throughput 
our customers benefit from needing fewer people  reduced hiring and training requirements and lower inventory levels with more turns 
in fiscal  we also moved into the clinical application area with ndc rx safety advisor  an application we believe will further differentiate us from our competitors 
our pharmacy application solutions directly affect a pharmacy s cash flow and margins 
the acquisition of techrx has strengthened our position in the key point of service prescription fulfillment area 
our strategy with techrx s new line of point of sale products is to convert the techrx revenue model to a transaction based model to create a recurring revenue stream 
the next major building block is claims processing for hospitals  as well as providing claims editing to increase the acceptance rate by payers of hospital claims and assist hospital management in improving cash flow and reducing outstanding accounts receivable 
ndc epremis  a new platform for revenue cycle management launched in fiscal  incorporates new technology  expands functional attributes and creates the base upon which new applications can be built 
this expands our opportunity to increase revenue by providing a broader suite of integrated services to customers 
this offering  using new application internet technology  allows us to upgrade our existing base of over  hospital customers  add new large hospitals and provides the opportunity to penetrate an entirely new market strata  small hospitals under beds 
similar to our pharmacy offerings  the new workflow features of this offering permit multiple people to work with claims simultaneously  yielding greater efficiency and better workload balancing 
ndc epremis can also be integrated into hospital information systems provided by various major companies such as siemens to further extend our market reach 
the third building block is the niche we have created in the physician market space 
we have sold our solutions to more than  physicians primarily in the physician practice group market 
physician s offices utilize our software and systems to do patient scheduling  billing and manage accounts receivables 
because of the relative lack of automation in small physician offices  we believe these customers represent a unique opportunity for expanded electronic service 
this electronic connection also 
table of contents assists our customers in improving their cash flow and provides an important communication channel to the physician 
we have already connected systems for  physicians to an on line network for electronic claims processing 
additionally  in conjunction with our pharmacy network and services  the predicted growth of e prescribing provides an important opportunity for us to become a leader in this emerging application area 
these three markets enable us to create access to data to develop applications for the fourth building block on line  value added information products primarily for pharmaceutical manufacturing companies 
by capturing claims and related transaction information through our network and combining it with purchased data  we can utilize our data analysis and data warehousing resources to allow our pharma customers to enhance their prescriber targeting capability  optimize sales force assignments  determine sales compensation and enhance competitiveness and margins 
in addition  by providing pharma customers with access to the capabilities of our value added pharmacy  hospital and physician networks  we are in a position to provide drug tracking to help eliminate counterfeit medicines and timely messages to assist patients and providers in enhancing the efficacy of their drug treatment 
in fiscal  our share of the healthcare pharmaceutical information market was approximately in the united states  based on the number of pharmaceutical sales representatives compensated utilizing our products  and we have a small partnership in the united kingdom and a presence in germany 
in fiscal  the pharmaceutical industry is faced with a slowing of new drug introductions 
industry analysts anticipate new drug introductions will accelerate in or in the interim  there will be pressure on our revenues from this group of customers 
in the near term  domestic revenues in this market are likely to remain relatively flat  a result of the cyclical downturn in the pharmaceutical industry 
we are committed to the information business and the pharma industry and will continue to invest in and manage the quality and cost effectiveness of our current applications 
at the same time we intend to move into new areas of opportunity in which we can leverage our claims transaction processing to be a unique provider of insightful  value adding applications 
we believe these actions will position us well for the future 
strategy we have recently completed our strategic planning and budgeting process and believe that our strategy is sound and appropriate 
to execute this strategy  we have developed an eight quarter plan through fiscal which has three key priorities  focus on revenue growth  control operational and administrative costs to realize margin improvement  and generate significant cash to reduce debt 
we believe this strategy  properly executed  will allow us to generate revenue growth even though our pharma revenue growth is expected to be relatively slow over the next eight quarters  with expected accelerating revenue and earnings growth toward the end of the eight quarter period 
we also expect execution of our strategy to generate significant cash flow over the next eight fiscal quarters  allowing us to pay down our debt and reduce our interest expense 
while not our primary focus  during the next eight fiscal quarters  situations may come to our attention in which an acquisition would complement both objectives of strengthening the balance sheet and executing our strategy 
in such events  we would expect to pursue such an opportunity 
our eight quarter plan calls for generation of more than million in free cash flow  which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends  significant reduction in our level of debt  thus reducing interest expense and lowering our debt to capital ratio toward a target of  revenue growth in the low double digit to mid teens in both of our business segments by the fourth quarter of fiscal  operating income margin expansion of more than basis points by the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  continued investment in new products and services focusing on our four key development initiatives which are 
table of contents developing the next generation pharmacy and mail order system platforms  building our unique medical repository database containing longitudinal data elements from all of healthcare  penetrating the growing market for electronic prescriptions  and gaining critical mass in our european operations in order to achieve profitability 
we have a number of new initiatives underway to allow us to realize the still very large untapped potential for our solutions in our existing markets 
our intensive execution focus has begun and we are confident about achievement of our eight quarter plan 
in the network services and systems segment  where we serve pharmacy  hospital and physician providers  we expect to see low double digit to mid teens revenue growth in fiscal the key drivers to revenue growth in this segment are further penetration of our provider customer base with additional value added transaction services to grow our revenue per claim  continued growth in claims  new product and service offerings  roll out of new system technology platforms in pharmacy and hospital with a recurring revenue pricing model  and continued gains in market share 
one of our strategies is to increase the percentage of recurring revenue in the network services and systems segment by shifting more of our pricing models to be transaction based 
we recognize that this creates pressure on revenue growth in the short term as we transition to the new model but it builds a reliable recurring revenue stream 
we expect operating income margins to expand in the network services and systems segment primarily due to increasing transaction scale in a high fixed cost business and positive contribution from new products and services 
in the information management segment  while there are some recent positive announcements among the pharmaceutical manufacturers  we continue to take a cautious view about the timing of a rebound in pharmaceutical spending 
therefore  in our eight quarter plan we are assuming that we will continue to be impacted by conditions in the pharma industry 
in fiscal  we expect single digit revenue growth in this segment 
our plan reflects relatively slow domestic revenue growth in fiscal compared to fiscal with most of the year over year growth coming from international expansion 
our european initiative  particularly germany  is very important to our overall strategy 
revenue is growing substantially although these operations are not yet profitable 
we expect to become profitable in europe as we gain scale 
in the short term  we expect operating income margins to decline in the information management segment due in part to costs associated with our international expansion  which includes higher costs to purchase historical data for new international products and countries 
margins are also impacted by the continued efforts of our domestic pharmaceutical customers to limit spending 
longer term  we believe the future is bright for the information management segment 
we will continue to generate additional revenue streams as we bring to market new solutions which leverage the claims processing resources of our network and move beyond the traditional sales and compensation product lines 
we expect these products to have higher margins 
as pharmaceutical manufacturers begin to accelerate the introduction of new drugs  we believe that pharma discretionary spending will increase and that our revenue growth in our various product lines in this segment will be in a mid teens range by the fourth quarter of fiscal operating income margins can also expand longer term through a re acceleration of revenue in this high fixed cost business  tight costs controls  and achievement of profitability in our international operations 
for the total company  we expect revenue to increase in a low double digit to mid teens range in fiscal as we considered our fiscal guidance  we took into account the following increases in expenses 
table of contents full year impact of higher interest expense associated with the debt financing completed in the first half of fiscal  a higher assumed tax rate of versus  anticipated finalization of rules requiring the expensing of stock options in the second half of fiscal  additional amortization related to the second step of the techrx acquisition  higher corporate costs associated with such items as additional pension expense and insurance premiums  and lower operating income margin in the information management segment due to efforts of our domestic pharmaceutical customers to limit spending and our need to purchase expensive historical data for international expansion 
these increased expenses will result in lower after tax margins in fiscal although we expect to see after tax margin acceleration over the eight quarter period 
for fiscal  we estimate that annual revenue will be approximately to million and diluted earnings per share will be in the range of to including planned restructuring charges described below 
we expect to see a sequential decline in revenue due to our normal summer seasonal trend of approximately to in the first quarter of from the fourth quarter of fiscal and  for the same two periods  the sequential trend in earnings per share will be impacted by expenses related to new product roll outs and additional corporate expenses 
we expect to continue to be a strong generator of cash  with fiscal net cash provided by operating activities in the range of to million 
we expect free cash flow to be in the range of to million in fiscal we expect to use cash flow to reduce debt in fiscal and allowing us to reduce interest expense and reduce our debt to capital ratio 
our goal is to bring our debt to capital ratio down toward our target of approximately over a two year period 
in a continuing effort to optimize our cost structure  we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately to per share in the first half of fiscal these charges are largely related to actions we plan to take to consolidate locations and reduce headcount with the closing of the techrx acquisition 
including these restructuring charges  we estimate that diluted earnings per share will be in the range of to for fiscal we are confident in our strategy and in our ability to execute our eight quarter plan 
as with any plan there are inherent risks  such as those discussed below in additional factors that may affect future performance  as well as additional opportunities 
our biggest opportunity continues to be further penetrating our existing customer base 
we are also aware of a number of other factors that could mitigate risks or perhaps favorably impact our results  including the medicare drug benefit being mandated into law and the consequent growth of claims and value added transaction volumes  accelerated adoption for electronic prescribing  greater interest among pharma customers for our new solutions which leverage our claims processing network  acceleration of pharma demand for our unique longitudinal analysis and other services from our medical repository database  strengthening of conditions in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry earlier than anticipated  increased demand for techrx products among mail order pharmacies  accelerated customer installations of new products and platforms  particularly in the hospital and pharmacy markets  and changes in the international landscape that could create additional opportunities for our solutions 
there is no assurance that any of these factors will materialize in fiscal or at all 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies are those policies that can have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations and require complex judgments and the most significant use of these subjective estimates and assumptions 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
specific risks inherent in our application of these critical policies are described below 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
these policies also often require difficult judgments on complex matters that may be subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
additional information concerning our accounting policies can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue although we have several sources of revenue  in all cases  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  delivery and performance has occurred  and collectibility is probable 
the most variable of these factors between our various businesses is determining when delivery and performance has occurred 
in our information management segment  we have two primary sources of revenue database information reporting and consulting services 
database information reporting typically involves the delivery of products providing pharmaceutical information 
these include products with a single delivery and products where multiple deliveries are made over a period of time 
revenue for products involving a single delivery is recognized when obligations to the customer have been fulfilled  which is typically upon delivery 
products with multiple deliveries over a period of time  usually to years  are generally unique in nature and therefore require more complex judgment to determine appropriate revenue recognition 
in most cases  information of a similar type is delivered at equal intervals over a fixed period of time in which case revenue is recognized over the term of the contract using a straight line model 
our consulting services are typically provided for a fixed fee over a specific period of time 
because the terms of these contracts generally include multiple performance milestones  revenue for these services is recognized over the contract term as performance milestones specified in the contract are achieved 
if we determine that we will incur a loss on a contract  we recognize the loss at the time the determination is made 
these contracts typically average to months 
in our network services and systems segment  the primary source of revenue is transaction fees charged for network services 
we provide these services to our pharmacy  hospital  physician  and payer customers 
these fees are generally based on the volume of services we provide to each individual customer 
in most instances  this fee is charged per transaction and type of transaction while in some instances  these services are provided to large customers for a fixed monthly fee  regardless of each month s actual transaction volume for a portion of the contract term 
we have begun the rollout of hosted web browser based applications for our hospital and pharmacy customers 
the per transaction charge for these services includes charges for the use of the application software  network  and other value added services 
revenue for these services is recognized each month as the services are rendered 
in our systems businesses  we also receive revenue from software licenses and related maintenance and support agreements 
in october  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
these sop s provide guidance on applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for software revenue recognition transactions 
based on these authoritative statements  we recognize revenue as follows revenues from the sale of software licenses and implementation services are recognized upon the date that the software is in operation at the customer site where vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  has been established for the undelivered elements of the customer contract  which typically is 
table of contents maintenance 
in these cases  the maintenance revenue is recognized over the term of the maintenance contract 
where vsoe cannot be established for undelivered elements within the contract  the revenue related to license fees and implementation services are deferred and recognized upon acceptance over the remaining term of the contract  typically two or three years 
the software we license to our customers is generally one of two types 
the most common software type performs functions such as scheduling and billing and is used by our customers to manage their businesses and connect to our network 
because this type of software has stand alone functionality meaning that connection to our network is not required for the software to be functional  we recognize revenue for sales of these type products that are customer installed when the product is shipped 
for products of this type that are installed by us or one of our affiliates  we recognize revenue when the software is installed 
the other type of software is used by our customers to process transactions through our network 
because this software provides value to our customers only to the extent that they are utilizing our network services  revenue is recognized over the estimated life of the network services contract rather than when the software is installed 
in instances where revenue is deferred over the term of a contract and we incur discrete incremental costs in providing the initial deliverable  we defer these costs and recognize them ratably over the contract term 
we provide software maintenance and customer support to our customers on both an as needed and long term basis 
services provided outside a maintenance contract are on an as requested basis and revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
revenue for services provided on a long term basis is recognized ratably over the terms of the contract 
many of our physician systems are sold indirectly through value added resellers  or vars 
because the vars provide many of the services that we would otherwise provide such as contract support  advertising  etc  we provide them allowances to cover their cost of providing these services 
we record revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products  which requires that certain allowances be treated as reductions in revenue and allows other allowances  for which we receive separable  identifiable and quantifiable benefits  to be recorded as revenue and operating expense 
capitalized software internally developed software held as property on our balance sheet consists of two types software that we develop for sale to our customers and software that we develop that is for internal use in providing services to our customers 
the costs associated with developing this software are capitalized differently depending on whether the software is for sale or for internal use 
in each instance  in accordance with sfas or sop costs are capitalized only when the project has reached the point of technological feasibility or the application development stage 
costs incurred prior to this point are charged to earnings as research and development expense 
for software sold to our customers  in accordance with sfas we capitalize both direct and indirect development costs such as programmers salaries and benefits  outside contractor costs  computer time  and allocated facility costs 
completed projects capitalized under sfas are amortized after reaching the point of general availability using the greater of the amount computed using the straight line method or the ratio that current revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated revenues  based on the estimated useful life of the project  normally five years 
the life used for amortization is based on the projected period of time that we will either sell the product or use the product to provide services  typically five years 
for software used internally  in accordance with sop direct development costs such as programmers salaries and benefits  and fees paid to others for development are capitalized 
completed projects capitalized under sop are amortized using the straight line method 
the life used for amortization is based on the projected period of time that we will use the software to provide services  typically five years 

table of contents the actual useful life of the product or software may be longer or shorter than the estimated useful life 
if the actual life is longer  we would continue to realize value from the asset while no longer recognizing a corresponding expense 
if the actual life is shorter or we determine that the investment will not be recovered through the future sales of products or services  the remaining carrying amount may need to be amortized over a shorter period or a non cash charge to earnings could be required 
the net realizable value of capitalized software is monitored on a periodic basis to ensure that the investment will be recovered through the future sale of products or in the case of internal software  through use 
investments we consider and selectively enter into a variety of alliances  joint ventures and investments 
as such  we maintain investments in both privately held and publicly traded entities 
our investments in privately held entities are accounted for under either the cost  equity  or consolidation method  whichever is appropriate for the particular investment 
the appropriate method is determined by our ability to exercise significant influence over the investee  through either quantity of voting stock or other means 
we regularly review our investments for impairment issues and propriety of current accounting treatment 
the primary method we use to determine whether or not an impairment issue exists is to compare the valuation of our investment with the underlying value of the entity in which we have an investment 
we determine the underlying value of the entity based on a number of factors  including the execution of business strategy and the steps that it has and is taking in the execution of that strategy  and the entity s subsequent financing activity 
if we determine that an impairment issue exists  we would realize the loss in other income expense in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
if we determine that our accounting treatment should change from the cost to equity method  in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 equity method of accounting for investments in common stock we would retroactively restate our previously issued financial statements as if we had always accounted for the investment under the equity method 
if our level of investment increased to a level such that we directly or indirectly controlled the entity  we would consolidate the entity s results into our consolidated financial statements 
our investments in publicly traded entities are classified as available for sale securities and are reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are reported  net of taxes  as a component of stockholders equity 
for example  if the market price of our investment has declined but we believe that the decline is only temporary because the underlying value of the business is higher than the market indicates  we will report the value of our investment at the price indicated by the market and report any change in the investment s value as an unrealized holding loss 
when a decline is determined to be other than temporary  we realize the gain or loss in other income expense 
intangible assets intangible assets are created when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the value of its tangible assets 
for any significant business we acquire  we obtain a valuation from an independent specialist which assists in the identification of any specific intangibles and provides assistance in our determination of an estimated value and life for each 
goodwill exists where our purchase price exceeds the value of tangible assets plus these specifically identified intangible assets 
specifically identified intangible assets primarily represent proprietary technology and customer relationships 
identified intangibles are assigned a value  generally that which was estimated in the valuation  and amortized over the estimated life 
because of the complexity of assumptions and judgment used in estimating the value and life of these assets  there is significant risk that their actual value and life may vary from the original estimate 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of intangibles may warrant revision or may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that an intangible should be evaluated for possible impairment  we estimate the present value of future cash flows associated with the asset over its remaining life 
we may determine that an intangible asset has diminished or has no remaining value prior to it being fully amortized 
in this instance  we would be required to incur a charge to earnings to impair the asset 

table of contents sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but be reviewed for impairment on a regular basis 
the goodwill impairment test has two steps 
the first step is to compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its book value 
we completed these tests during the second quarter of fiscal by comparing the present value of the estimated future cash flows of each of our reporting units to the book value of that unit s assets 
our reporting units are defined as our pharmacy  hospital  and physician businesses in our network services and systems segment plus our total information management segment 
for each of our reporting units  we found that the estimated fair value exceeded the net book value of the unit and therefore the second step was not necessary 
due to the size of the techrx acquisition  we updated our test for the pharmacy reporting unit as of may  and found that no adjustments were required 
if the estimated current value of future cash flows of any reporting unit had been lower than its book value  the second step would have been to calculate the possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount 
any impairment would require a non cash charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment was identified 
we will conduct these same tests going forward at least annually to ensure that goodwill carried on our balance sheet is properly valued 
recently issued accounting pronouncements we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in the first quarter of fiscal sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and requires that discontinued operations be measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell

in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we are currently evaluating several business relationships or interests that could possibly be considered variable interest entities and whether we would have to consolidate or deconsolidate such entities

the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to increased transaction volumes and growth in customer base in the pharmacy and hospital markets and increased revenue from our network adjudication for pharmacies 
revenue from divested businesses other accounted for million and million of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
operating expenses our most significant expenses are compensation  data costs  depreciation and amortization  and communications expense 
together these expenses represented over of our operating expenses in fiscal cost of service includes certain compensation  computer operations  data costs  consulting services  telecommunications  customer support  and application maintenance expenses 
sales  general and administrative expense includes certain compensation  sales  marketing  administration  and corporate overhead expenses 

table of contents compensation expense as a service organization  compensation is our largest expense and we continue to monitor it closely 
in general  we are not always able to pass our inflationary cost increases on to our customers 
as our costs go up  we must find new ways to operate our business in order to reduce costs and improve productivity 
this includes addressing under performing projects  products and people 
as a percent of revenue  compensation expense  which includes incentive pay  commissions  and related fringe benefits  and is net of capitalized labor  has been decreasing 
this decrease is due to increased productivity as a result of our training initiatives and cost control efforts  divestiture of less productive businesses  and the scalability of our business model

we expect that cos  as a percentage of revenue  will be relatively consistent in data costs we buy data from various sources to supplement our own data collection efforts

in fiscal we began offering a frame network to our customers 
the frame network provides a secure and reliable form of communications at a lower cost than private lines 
we also negotiated new contracts with our vendors under more favorable terms 
we continue to look at new technologies that will allow us to provide superior service to our customers at reduced cost 
however  because competition in the telecommunications industry has resulted in historically low communications costs  we do not expect significant future reductions in communications costs 

table of contents in millions communication costs revenue percent of revenue software costs software costs are related to the development of new products and maintenance and enhancement of existing products 
we capitalize the cost of developing software held for sale to our customers as well as software used internally to provide services to our customers 
depreciation expenses associated with capitalized software are discussed below under depreciation and amortization 
our current focus is developing new products such as t rex enterprise  next generation projection  eprescribing  weekly snr  canada ppe  dynamic claims analyzer  future rx  payment optimizer  fraud abuse  rx safety advisor  and products for the united kingdom and german markets 
capitalized software development costs increased from fiscal to fiscal reflecting increased development effort due to the acquisition of techrx 
total costs associated with software development for techrx were million in fiscal approximately million of these development costs were capitalized resulting in net development expense associated with techrx of approximately million

sg a expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percent of revenue  during fiscal   and  sg a expense was   and  respectively 
this decline in sg a margin is due to centralization efforts and cost containments 
we expect that sg a expense  as a percentage of revenue  will be flat or increase in due to continued investment in our sales and marketing programs to support the roll out of new products  increased corporate governance expenses  and increases in equity compensation programs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal from fiscal as a result of the techrx and scriptline acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal depreciation and amortization expense decreased significantly in fiscal from fiscal due to our adoption of sfas no 
because goodwill was no longer amortized in fiscal  amortization expense decreased million 
table of contents from fiscal depreciation and amortization expense will increase in fiscal as newly developed products are placed in service and intangible assets acquired in the techrx acquisition are amortized 
in millions depreciation and amortization revenue percent of revenue operating income operating income grew million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal operating income grew million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal operating income growth from fiscal to fiscal was slower than revenue growth due to the inclusion of techrx  restructuring  impairment and other charges of million  and acquisition related expenses of million 
a portion of the increase in operating income from fiscal to fiscal was due to our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas deals with  among other things  amortization of goodwill 
because goodwill was no longer amortized in fiscal  amortization expense decreased million from fiscal the remainder of the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to increased leverage of our infrastructure 
fiscal and represented a major transition period for our company 
the decision was made to focus management attention on the core information management and network services and systems businesses 
accordingly  actions were initiated to eliminate non core as well as obsolete and redundant product and service offerings 
in addition  we accelerated clearinghouse integration  consolidation of locations  and associated staff and expense reductions 
the majority of these actions were completed during fiscal however  as these actions were finalized and implemented  an additional million of restructuring and impairment charges were incurred during the second quarter of fiscal of this total  approximately million were cash items that were accrued at the time the charges were incurred 
these cash items include severance and related costs of million and facility exit costs of million 
the severance and related costs arose from actions to reduce personnel staffing in areas of redundant operations and activities 
these charges reflect specifically identified executives and employees who were informed of their termination during the second quarter of fiscal the facility costs relate to a location that was closed during that quarter 
the remaining million of this impairment charge was the result of the write down and divestiture of a non core operation 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate in fiscal   and was   and respectively

interest and other expense interest and other expense consists primarily of interest expense  amortization of debt issuance costs and other miscellaneous non operating expense 
as a percent of revenue  during fiscal   and  interest and other expense was   and respectively 
as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below and in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we 
table of contents completed a refinancing in fiscal we expect interest expense to be higher in fiscal due to the additional debt and higher weighted average rates being in place for the full fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources payments from our customers are our greatest source of liquidity 
additional sources of liquidity include our credit facility  financing under capital lease arrangements  vendor financing  and issuances of common stock and other instruments 
the cash provided by these sources has a variety of uses 
most importantly  we must pay our employees and vendors for the services and materials they supply 
additional uses include  among other things  expenditures for new capital equipment  development of additional products  investments in alliances  acquisitions  payment of taxes  payment of dividends  extension of credit to our customers  and to generally fund our operations 
our operating cash requirements are generally satisfied with our customer receipts because we receive a higher level of cash from our customers than we expend for payments of salaries and other recurring operating costs 
excess cash that we generate after satisfying all of our continuing operating requirements is shown on our statement of cash flows as net cash provided by operating activities 
this measure takes into account items such as non cash expenses included in our operating income  cash used to extend credit to our customers  and cash provided by our vendors extending credit to us 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  an increase from million in fiscal net income adjusted for non cash items including equity in losses of affiliated companies  restructuring  impairment and other charges  early extinguishment of debt charges  loss related to investments  and depreciation and amortization was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal net operating loss carry forwards  or nols  related to our continuing operations allowed us to reduce our cash tax payments by million in fiscal the majority of the benefit received from nol s in fiscal was provided by discontinued operations and therefore is not included in net cash provided by operating activities 
thus  on a combined basis  income taxes in fiscal versus fiscal represent an increase in cash flow of million 
as a result of our acquisition of techrx  in fiscal we will begin to recognize the benefit of nols previously generated by techrx of approximately to million 
we expect to be able to utilize approximately half of this benefit in fiscal thereby reducing our cash tax payments by approximately to million in fiscal  positively impacting net cash provided by operating activities 
the other primary driver of the increase in operating cash flows in fiscal versus fiscal is an emerging item  accrued interest on long term debt 
in november we completed a refinancing discussed in detail below  which significantly increased our interest expense from the prior year 
because interest payments on the million of senior subordinated notes issued in the refinancing are made on june and december of each year  we had a significant amount of accrued interest on our balance sheet at may  cash payment of this interest will be made in the first quarter of fiscal other significant differences between fiscal and fiscal are accounts receivable  prepaid and other current assets  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  and deferred revenue 
collectively  these changes in working capital used million of cash in fiscal versus million of cash in fiscal changes in working capital are the result of the timing of receipts from our customers and our payments to vendors  and the timing difference between billing customers for services as required by their contracts and our recognition of related revenue 
in our network systems and services segment  our strategy is to market a complete set of solutions rather than individual products that we emphasized in the past 
as a result  more of our network contracts are subject to eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the impact is an increase in cash and deferred revenue as the customer may remit payment in advance even though revenue is recognized in future periods 
the nature of an information services business is such that it requires a substantial continuing investment in technology equipment and product development in order to expand the business 
we are generally able to internally fund these investments from excess cash generated from operations 
additionally  historically we have also expanded our business through acquisitions and strategic investments in other businesses 
the cash we use to expand our business is shown as net cash used in 
table of contents investing activities 
capital expenditures  which reflect our investment in equipment and product development such as software costs discussed above  were million in fiscal  including million in capitalized software costs and million in capitalized interest  and million in fiscal  including million in capitalized software costs 
the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal is due primarily to techrx 
capital expenditures attributable to techrx were million in fiscal and primarily represent the continuing investment in the next generation pharmacy systems platform 
capital expenditures were funded from cash from operations in both years 
because our credit facility discussed below places limitations on our level of capital expenditures  we do not expect capital expenditures to exceed million in fiscal  including approximately million in capitalized software costs 
we used million of cash in fiscal to complete acquisitions  primarily the completion of our acquisition of techrx 
we acquired a controlling interest in techrx in fiscal as the first step of an agreement to acquire all of their outstanding shares in a two step transaction 
under the second step  which closed on may   we acquired all remaining shares in techrx from minority stockholders for in cash for each techrx common share  or an aggregate of million  net 
additionally  we used million of cash in fiscal for investing activities and other non current assets  which primarily represents payment of merger related costs associated with our acquisition of techrx and million for the acquisition of german pharmaceutical data related to the development of a new informatics product 
during fiscal  the acquisition of a controlling interest in techrx and select assets of scriptline from arclight systems used cash totaling million 
acquisitions in fiscal  including our german informatics business and a printing services business in the u 
s  used million of cash 
the fiscal acquisitions were funded with cash from operations whereas the fiscal and acquisitions were funded with both borrowings under our credit facility and cash from operations 
in november  we completed a refinancing that included a new million senior secured credit facility and the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes due in an unregistered offering pursuant to rule a and regulations under the securities act of we intend to offer to exchange the unregistered notes for substantially identical registered senior subordinated notes following the filing of this report 
the million senior secured credit facility consists of a million five year revolving credit facility and a million six year term loan 
this secured credit facility replaced our million unsecured revolving line of credit and became effective on november  the million revolving credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes and has a variable interest rate based on market rates 
as of may   no borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the million term loan has a variable interest rate based on market rates with a floor of 
borrowings under the credit facility are guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a pledge of the capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries and of the voting stock of our first tier material foreign subsidiaries 
our obligations are also secured by a perfected lien and security interest in substantially all of our and such domestic subsidiaries tangible and intangible assets 
under certain circumstances  future material subsidiaries will be required to guarantee the credit facility and to secure their guarantees with substantially all of their tangible and intangible property 
similarly  under certain circumstances  we will pledge of the voting stock of our future first tier foreign subsidiaries to the lenders under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains certain financial and non financial covenants customary for financings of this nature  such as limiting our level of capital expenditures and requiring us to maintain a certain leverage ratio of debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is defined in the credit agreement as income before equity in losses of affiliated companies  plus income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  and certain other non cash losses on asset disposition  less minority interest in losses 
as of may   we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants and expect to remain in compliance in the foreseeable future 

table of contents the million senior subordinated notes are our senior unsecured subordinated obligations  will mature on december   and are classified as fixed rate borrowings 
the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  on an unsecured senior subordinated basis by the subsidiary guarantors that guarantee our credit facility 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year and interest is payable on june and december of each year 
interest is computed on the basis of a day year comprised of twelve day months 
as of may   the fair market value of the notes was approximately million 
we received million in proceeds from the million term loan  net of million in costs related to the entire million credit facility  and million in proceeds from the issuance of the notes  net of million in debt issuance costs 
the issuance costs associated with the refinancing are being amortized over the life of the credit facility and notes 
we used million of the net proceeds from the refinancing to repay all indebtedness outstanding under our previous revolving credit facility 
as a result of the retirement of this credit facility  we incurred million in early extinguishment charges 
million of the net proceeds from the refinancing were used for redemption of our convertible subordinated notes due november the redemption amount consisted of million in principal  million in accrued interest  and million in early redemption premium 
as a result of the redemption of the convertible notes  we also incurred a charge of million for the write off of debt issuance costs 
we borrowed million under our million unsecured revolving line of credit in fiscal in order to partially fund the acquisitions described above 
in fiscal  we used million of the million cash dividend from global payments to pay the balance outstanding under our previous line of credit at the time of the spin off 
stock activities provide us an additional source of liquidity 
stock activities are primarily related to the exercises of employee stock options and issues under the employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  issuance of shares of our common stock generated million versus million in fiscal although the issuance of additional shares provides us with liquidity  it results in a dilution of each individual stockholder s equity 
another use of cash is the payment of dividends which totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal net operating loss carry forwards related to our discontinued operations allowed us to reduce our cash tax payments by million in fiscal and million in fiscal we do not expect any additional benefit from nol s related to our discontinued operations 
discontinued operations also used million in fiscal  primarily in the settling of liabilities  versus million in fiscal we believe that our current level of cash on hand  future cash flows from operations  and our credit facility are sufficient to meet our operating needs in a summary of our contractual obligations are presented below in millions contractual obligations payments due by period years years after years total long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations 
table of contents competitive forces as stated in item business of this report  we have a number of competitors 
we compete with in house capabilities of healthcare organizations 
we compete with other vendors of information products and services in the healthcare information industry such as ims health  inc we compete with other providers of transaction services such as webmd corp 
we also compete with a number of smaller vendors of pharmacy  physician  provider  and hospital solutions 
a key factor for our success in the competitive landscape is speed to market of innovative new products and product enhancements that provide benefit to our customers 
products added in fiscal include t rex one a first of its kind next generation pharmacy system has been rolled out to independent pharmacies 
included in the t rex one package are third party claims transmissions via the ndchealth intelligent network  ndc pre and post editing  software and upgrades  centralized prescriber and product pricing data  automated data backup and storage  electronic prescription capability  digital signature capture  pos interface and a variety of reports

ndc practitioner linkmaster a relational identifier that links multiple data supplier identifiers to a unique practitioner  providing a current  stable database of practitioner information 
ndc weekly payer rx organization enables pharmaceutical manufacturers to target and measure performance and compensation on a weekly basis 
government regulation the direction of the healthcare industry is influenced by legislation at both the federal and state levels 
forced changes through legislation can be disruptive to business processes and strategies  but at the same time can provide opportunities for us  given our scale  market presence  knowledge base and information solutions scope 
for example  should the much discussed drug benefit program under medicare become law  we expect it would provide us with more transaction processing editing opportunities  as well as create a need for new insights from our informatics offerings for both the pharmaceutical manufacturer and pharmacy markets 
all of our products are designed to be compliant with hipaa regulations 
however  additional federal or state legislation relative to patient privacy or utilization of physician 
table of contents prescribing information could adversely affect the scope of our informatics offerings 
as we become aware of changes  we intend to incorporate possibilities into strategy alternatives and be prepared to capitalize on opportunities 
relationships and alliances cardinal health alliance in may  we entered into a strategic alliance with the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment of cardinal health  inc  to market and develop products and services for the healthcare industry jointly 
as part of the alliance  ndchealth editing services under the scriptline brand will continue to be offered to pharmacies exclusively by cardinal health 
the alliance also provides for joint development between us and cardinal health of additional marketing programs  products and services 
we continue to grow scriptline together and are pursuing several new strategic initiatives 
cegedim alliance in december  we created a joint venture in the united kingdom with cegedim  sa  a french information services company 
we have combined our informatics businesses under the name infopharm to broaden the product offerings to pharmaceutical manufacturers in the united kingdom 
the financial results of the joint venture are recorded on our statement of operations as equity in losses of affiliated companies 
medunite alliance during july  in exchange for the contribution of the assets of our physician network services business  we received an interest and became an investor in medunite  inc along with several leading us health insurance companies 
medunite offered a nationwide edi based transaction system to connect providers and payers 
on august   the financial advisors to medunite s board of directors advised us that they had evaluated several preliminary proposals related to a recapitalization plan and selected parties with which they intended to proceed with a potential recapitalization or sale transaction 
in addition  we understood that other parties had indicated their interest in submitting a proposal to medunite 
at that time  the net carrying value of our investment was approximately million  consisting of million in equity  million in convertible debt  and million in promissory notes and accrued interest 
based upon the information received from medunite s financial advisors  as well as an updated evaluation of medunite s results and of capital market conditions  we determined that the fair value of our investment was approximately million  the amount of proceeds that we expected to receive from the recapitalization or sale of medunite 
therefore  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we incurred a million non cash charge in fiscal to reduce the carrying value of our equity investment in medunite 
following the charge to reduce the carrying value of the investment  we continued to believe that our investment in medunite was recoverable and believed our investment in medunite was appropriately valued at approximately million  consisting of million in equity  million in convertible debt  and million in promissory notes and accrued interest 
on december   proxymed  inc purchased medunite  and in exchange for our equity investment in medunite of million  we received convertible debt totaling million from proxymed 
our remaining investment in medunite  consisting of million in convertible debt  million in promissory notes and accrued interest  and trade receivables from medunite of million not included in the carrying value of our investment was restructured into a million three year note from proxymed 
in order to determine the appropriate carrying value of the convertible debt and note issued by proxymed  we evaluated the interest rates of the convertible debt and the new note  the long term nature of the note  our current borrowing rate  and the financial condition of proxymed and its ability to satisfy the 
table of contents terms of the convertible debt and note 
accordingly  during fiscal we recorded a charge of million to record the loss on the value of our investment and to establish a reserve for trade receivables owed by medunite 
of this charge  million is related to our investment basis and is included in our statement of operations in loss related to investments and million is related to trade receivables and is included in our statement of operations in restructuring  impairment and other charges 
in conjunction with the sale of our interest in medunite to proxymed  we also evaluated other aspects of our medunite relationship 
as part of this evaluation we identified an additional million of trade receivables that we believe became uncollectible as a result of the change in relationship with medunite 
accordingly  we recorded a charge of million  which is included in our statement of operations in restructuring  impairment and other charges  in fiscal to reserve for these receivables 
because of on going claims related to our investment in medunite and the impairment of other related assets  an additional charge of million was recorded during the third quarter of fiscal because the claims were resolved for a lesser amount than originally reserved  million of this charge was reversed in the fourth quarter of fiscal this net charge is included in loss related to investments 
in fiscal  revenue related to medunite prior to the sale to proxymed was approximately million 
global payments on february   we completed the spin off of global payments  inc  our former payment services business 
because of the nature of certain systems we shared with global payments  prior to the spin off  we jointly determined that it was in the best interest of both companies for us to continue to provide services to global payments utilizing these systems 
therefore  we entered into a network services agreement whereby we provide transaction processing services for global payments 
global payments reimburses us for these services at a rate that approximates our costs and is established annually 
the initial term of the agreement ends january  and is extendable for two additional years 
in addition  global payments currently occupies an office building we own that is adjacent to our corporate headquarters 
we maintain the building  which global payments occupied prior to the spin off  as a part of our corporate campus 
as part of the spin off agreement  the building is currently leased to global payments at a rate that approximates our cost of maintaining the building for a term ending january  we are currently negotiating an extension of this lease to coincide with an extension of the network services agreement 
additional factors that may affect future performance in addition to the other information provided in our reports  including this report  the following risk factors may affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have provided the following risk factor disclosure in conjunction with our continuing effort to qualify our written and oral forward looking statements for the protection of any safe harbor provision that protects companies from securities law liability in connection with such forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise our forward looking statements or these risk factors to reflect future developments  changed assumptions  the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results 
important factors currently known to our management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements include the disclosures contained elsewhere in this report and the following we may experience volatility in our stock price 
the market price of our common stock may experience significant volatility from time to time 
such volatility may be affected by factors such as our quarterly operating results or changes in the economy  financial markets or the healthcare information and transaction processing industries  specifically  or the healthcare industry in general 
in recent years  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have sometimes affected the market price of the securities issued by a particular company which may be unrelated to the operational performance of the company 
this type of market effect could impact our common stock price as well 
in addition  we may be subject to securities class action 
table of contents litigation if the market price of our stock experiences significant volatility 
our management s attention and resources may be diverted from normal operations if we would become subject to any securities class action  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
intense competition could damage our sales and profitability 
if we are unable to compete successfully with providers of systems and services similar to ours  we may lose significant revenue 
we compete not only with independent providers of similar systems and services  but also with customers and potential customers internal divisions that provide similar services 
the markets in which we offer our systems and services are highly competitive with respect to functionality of products and services  price  quality and innovation 
competition in the markets in which we offer our systems and services affects our ability to attract new customers and keep existing ones  hire quality employees  and charge prices for our products and services that will maximize our profitability 
some of our competitors have greater access to capital and marketing and technological resources  and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully with them 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 
our substantial amount of indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it could limit our ability to obtain additional financing  if needed  for working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions  make it more difficult for us to sustain our cash flow during economic or industry downturns because of an inability to expand our product offerings  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available for working capital  capital expenditures acquisitions  developing new products and other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry due to a lack of cash flow to finance changes in our business  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness and thus greater resources to devote to upgrading their technology  increasing their product offerings and expanding their business 
the cost of litigation could reduce our results of operations 
from time to time we are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business 
while we intend to defend vigorously any lawsuits that may be filed against us  it is possible that litigation costs or an adverse ruling in a litigation matter could have a material adverse impact on our financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
we may lose customers or revenue due to consolidation in the healthcare industry 
there has been and continues to be significant consolidation in the healthcare industry  which may reduce the number of existing customers for our services and may reduce the price we are able to charge those customers 
in addition  this consolidation of healthcare providers and pharmaceutical suppliers may reduce the number of our potential customers 
the increased purchasing power of larger consolidated organizations could also lead to reductions in the amounts these organizations are willing to pay for our services 
we cannot predict the overall impact of consolidation in the healthcare industries  and it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability may suffer if we are unable to continue our expansion in new and existing markets 
our future growth and profitability depends  in part  upon our continued expansion within the healthcare electronic transaction processing and information services markets in which we currently operate  the further expansion of these markets  the emergence of other markets for electronic transaction 
table of contents processing and healthcare information services and our ability to penetrate these markets 
as part of our strategy to expand into new and existing markets  we seek selective acquisition opportunities and alliance relationships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration  technological capabilities  product offerings and distribution capabilities 
we cannot predict whether we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future  or whether any acquisition will provide us with the ability to expand into new markets 
expansion of the healthcare information services and electronic transaction processing markets is dependent upon the continued automation of traditional paper based processing systems and demand for new decision support applications 
our ability to penetrate these markets depends upon our ability to apply our existing technology  or to develop new technology  to meet the particular service needs of each new or expanded market 
we cannot guarantee that markets for our services will continue to expand and develop  that we will be successful in our efforts to meet the demands of these markets  or that we will have adequate financial  marketing and technological resources to penetrate new markets 
defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases of the company s products by large customers could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we have significant relationships with a limited number of large customers in our electronic processing and information services businesses 
any defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases from us by these large customers could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we may spend significant resources developing and promoting new products or solutions that may not meet the demands of our customers 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
we cannot ensure that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services or that our products and services will adequately meet the quickly changing demands of our customers 
in addition  in order to meet our customers demands  we are continually involved in a number of development projects  including our effort to update our core mainframe based products for the healthcare information services markets 
because we cannot predict the time and cost required in reaching certain research  development and engineering objectives  the costs of product development initiatives could significantly exceed our estimates  and project development schedules could require extensions 
in either of these events  our profitability and overall results of operations could be adversely affected 
we believe that the future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our current product and service offerings and to continually develop and introduce new products and services that will keep pace with technological advances and satisfy evolving customer requirements 
further  we cannot ensure that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these products and services 
in particular  in connection with our roll out of the various t rex products  we cannot assure that we will not incur development costs in excess of what we have planned or that the roll out will not be delayed 
an inability to develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner  or an unsuccessful new or updated product could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
interruptions may occur in some of our information services 
our information services may experience service interruptions  due to failures of internal systems or services provided by third parties  including our telecommunication carriers 
customers using the affected services may experience losses caused by these service interruptions 
we may be subject to breach of contract claims  or be required to pay service credits because of these performance failures 
in addition  we may have to incur additional expense to correct these conditions 
proprietary technology protections may not be adequate and proprietary rights may infringe on rights of third parties 

table of contents we rely on a combination of trade secret  patent  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and processes 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
although we believe that our products and other proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future 
additionally  we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets  to enforce our patent  copyright and trademark rights  and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation can be costly and time consuming 
litigation expenses or any damage payments resulting from adverse determinations of third party claims could be significant and result in material losses to us 
recent and future combinations and strategic relationships may not be profitable 
we are currently devoting significant management resources and other resources toward the integration of our recent acquisition of techrx incorporated 
we may not be able to successfully integrate our operations with those of techrx or future acquisitions 
even if integration occurs successfully  failure to achieve levels of revenue growth  profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing operations  or failure to otherwise perform as expected  may adversely impact our revenue and profitability 
complex state and federal regulations could depress the demand for information products or impact the availability to us of certain data  and we could incur redesign costs or be subject to penalties 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  regulatory and other influences 
these factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations 
federal and state legislatures and agencies periodically consider programs to reform or revise the us healthcare system 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates  restrict availability or use of data  or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate 
we are unable to predict future proposals with any certainty or to predict the effect they would have on our business 
hipaa administrative simplification under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  congress required the adoption of rules to establish standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of certain health information 
published rules include standards for electronic transactions  published august   standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information  published december   and standards for unique employer identifiers  published may  these rules generally restrict the use and disclosure  and mandate security  of personally identifiable health information 
the hipaa rules apply to healthcare providers  health plans  including employer sponsored group health plans  and healthcare clearinghouses  as well as indirectly  in certain instances  to those who provide services on behalf of these entities which involve the receipt or disclosure of health information 
certain of our operations are subject to the hipaa rules 
compliance with these final rules will be costly and could require complex changes in our systems 
transaction standards the standards for electronic transactions rule requires format standards for eight of the most common healthcare transactions  using technical standards issued by certain recognized standards publishing organizations 
healthcare providers  plans and clearinghouses transmitting or receiving any of these eight health transactions electronically must send and receive data using a common format  rather than the large number of different data formats currently used 
we are required to comply with the transaction standards by october  
table of contents the transaction standards are applicable to that portion of our business involving the processing of healthcare transactions among providers  payers and other healthcare industry participants 
the transaction standards apply to many of our customers and to our relationships with those customers 
we intend to comply with the transaction standards by the compliance dates  but our customers and business partners may elect to file extensions 
compliance may require costly modifications to some of our systems  products and services 
we believe that we are well positioned to make these changes and assist our customers and strategic partners with compliance 
however  there can be no assurance that we or our customers or strategic partners will be able to do so in a timely manner  or that we will be able to take advantage of any business opportunities or react to changes that may result from implementation of the transaction standards 
other state and federal statutes and regulations governing transmission of healthcare information may affect our operations 
for example  medicaid rules require some processing services and eligibility verification to be maintained as separate and distinct operations 
we carefully review our practices in an effort to ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws 
these laws  though  are complex and changing  and the courts and other governmental authorities may take positions that are inconsistent with our practices thereby increasing our costs of complying or otherwise adversely affecting our operations 
privacy standards the standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information rule establishes a set of national privacy standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by health plans  healthcare clearinghouses  healthcare providers and their business associates 
this rule governs the use and disclosure of such information  and establishes procedures for access to and amendment of information in designated record sets 
the compliance date for most entities was april  and we have put into place the processes and procedures to comply with these standards and believe that that we are in compliance with these standards 
the privacy standards rule applies to the portions of our business that process healthcare transactions and provide technical services to other participants in the healthcare industry 
this rule provides for civil and criminal liability for violations  and requires us  our customers and our partners to use health information in a highly restricted manner  to establish policies and procedures to safeguard the information  and may require us to obtain individual authorizations and acknowledgements in some cases  and to provide certain access rights to individuals 
this rule may require us to incur significant costs to change our systems and services  and may restrict the manner in which we transmit and use the information 
in addition  our provider or payer customers may elect to transmit information directly without using a clearinghouse  or may restrict our access to information needed to support our information services business 
each of these events could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues 
numerous state and federal laws other than hipaa govern the collection  dissemination  use  access to and confidentiality of patient health information 
many states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality of medical records or medical information 
these state laws are not in all cases preempted by the hipaa privacy standard and may be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities  thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us  our customers and business partners 
regulations governing electronic health data transmissions are evolving rapidly and are often unclear and difficult to apply 
these other privacy laws at a state or federal level  or new interpretations of these laws  could create liability for us  could impose additional operational requirements on our business  could affect the manner in which we use and transmit information and could increase our cost of doing business 
in addition  determining whether data has been sufficiently de identified may require complex factual and statistical analyses 
security standards the security rules promulgated pursuant to hipaa were issued in final form on february  the security rules establish a minimum standard for the protection of individual health information that is stored or transmitted electronically 
the rules provide administrative procedures  physical safeguards  and technical mechanisms that may be implemented to satisfy the regulations 
while the company does not expect significant changes to its current operations due to these rules  they could result in 
table of contents additional financial obligations for us and failure to maintain compliance could pose increased regulatory risk 
international data regulation other countries also have  or are developing  their own laws governing the collection  use  storage and dissemination of personal information or patient data 
these laws could create liability for our international operations  impose additional operations requirements or restrictions on our business  affect the manner in which we use or transmit data and or increase our cost of doing business 
regulation of healthcare relationships federal and state laws govern patient referrals  physician financial relationships and inducements to beneficiaries of federal healthcare programs 
the federal anti kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering  paying  soliciting or receiving anything of value  directly or indirectly  for the referral of patients covered by medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing  purchasing  ordering or arranging for or recommending the lease  purchase or order of any item  good  facility or service covered by these programs 
the anti kickback law is broad and may apply to some of our activities or our relationships with our customers  or business partners 
penalties for violating the anti kickback law include imprisonment  fines and exclusion from participating  directly or indirectly  in medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs 
many states have similar anti kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal healthcare program 
we carefully review our practices in an effort to ensure that we comply with all applicable laws 
however  the laws in this area are both broad and vague and it is often difficult or impossible to determine precisely how the laws will be applied 
any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our practices violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties and require us to change or terminate some portions of our business 
in addition  federal and state agencies have been conducting investigations purportedly related to referral and billing practices of hospitals  laboratories and similar institutions 
although we currently monitor our arrangements with healthcare institutions to ensure compliance with prevailing industry practices and applicable law  we cannot guarantee that governmental investigators will not take positions that are inconsistent with our practices 
in order to remain competitive and satisfy the requirements and needs of our clients  we must remain informed of and adapt to new regulations governing the transmission  use and processing of personal information in electronic commerce and over the internet 
although many of these regulations may not apply directly to our business  we expect that these regulations and any new laws regulating the solicitation  collection or processing of personal or consumer information could indirectly affect our business 
our efforts to remain competitive and profitable and ensure compliance  and our customer s compliance  with these regulations may require the expenditure of significant sums in research and development and investments in new technology and processes and will require significant attention from senior management 
changes in the united states healthcare environment could have a material negative impact on our revenues 
in recent years  the healthcare industry  including the healthcare financing and reimbursement system  has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs 
these changes include increased use of managed care  cuts in medicare and medicaid payment and reimbursement levels  consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical surgical supply distributors  and the development of large  sophisticated purchasing groups 
we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future 
some of these changes  such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes in the delivery or pricing of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits  may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the price they are willing to pay for our products and 
table of contents services 
changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers research and distribution policies could also reduce our income 
we are unable to predict the effect of such changes on our operations and profitability 
unanticipated changes in our accounting policies may be required because of mandates by standards setting organizations and could have a material impact on our financial statements 
in the process of managing our business and reporting financial results we rely on estimates and judgments made by management in the reporting and comparison of financial results 
these judgments are based on the standards in place at that time 
standards setting organizations are continuously reviewing the methodology and application of standards previously set and adjusting them as they deem appropriate 
in addition  new accounting standards may be formulated and released that could affect our reporting of actual results or outlook for anticipated future results 
if these revised or new standards cause us to restate financial results from prior accounting periods it could have a negative impact on our previously reported results 
similarly  if revised or new standards affect reporting of results in the current or future periods the comparison to prior results under the old accounting standards may not be favorable 
investors are urged to use caution in this area in light of the current focus by regulatory agencies on accounting standards 
we may need additional capital to continue our growth and expansion 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future  including borrowings under an additional or replacement credit facility  if such a credit facility is available  to finance acquisitions 
as a result  we may be subject to risks associated with debt financing  including increased interest rate expense  insufficient cash flow to meet required payments on our debt  inability to meet credit facility covenants  and inability to refinance or repay the debt as it comes due 
our data suppliers may restrict or modify access to their data 
changes in the healthcare industry legal environment such as hipaa and similar state laws may cause key data suppliers to reevaluate data that they send to us for use in our data products 
we can offer no assurance that our data suppliers will continue to send data in historical manners 
interruptions or alterations in data streams could impede our ability to perform under current data product contracts  and reduce our revenue or result in contract damages for nonperformance 
our anti takeover provisions may limit stockholder value 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws  our stockholder protection rights agreement  and delaware law may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest 
a stockholder may not receive as much in exchange for his or her shares as they could without these provisions 
the following is a description of the provisions that may reduce the market prices for our shares of common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and our by laws separate our board of directors into three classes of directors  with each class as nearly equal in number as the total number of directors permits 
each class serves for three year terms  and each class term expires in different successive years 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more classes or series and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any action on the part of the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
our stockholder rights plan issues rights to our common stockholders  which entitle them to purchase preferred stock upon the happening of certain events 
these rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors unless the offer contains certain conditions 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law 
table of contents prohibits certain persons from engaging in business combinations  which may also have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change of control 
if we lose the tax free status of the spinoff  stockholders and the company could be subject to substantial tax liability 
as part of our spinoff of global payments  inc  we received a tax ruling relating to the qualification of the distribution as a tax free distribution within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code 
the continuing validity of a tax ruling is subject to certain factual representations and assumptions 
if the distribution were to lose its status as a tax free distribution  we would recognize taxable gain equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common stock distributed to our stockholders over our tax basis in the stock 
in addition  each ndchealth stockholder who received global payments  inc common stock in the distribution would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the stock 
if the distribution is disqualified as tax free to ndchealth because of certain post distribution circumstances  we would recognize taxable gain but the distribution would generally remain tax free to each ndchealth stockholder 
under the tax sharing and indemnification agreement between us and global payments  inc  if the distribution fails to qualify as a tax free distribution because of an acquisition of their stock or assets  or some other action of theirs  then global payments  inc would be solely liable for any resulting corporate taxes 
however  if global payments  inc fails to indemnify us  we would be jointly and severally liable for federal income taxes resulting from the distribution being taxable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have performed sensitivity analyses over the near term regarding the risks listed below 
based on these sensitivity analyses  we are not exposed to material market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and or ndchealth equity prices 
we also do not anticipate any material risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and or ndchealth equity prices 
interest rate we have a credit facility which has variable interest rates for eurodollar and other floating rate advances based on the london interbank offered rate  prime rate  or federal funds  in each case plus applicable margin 
accordingly  we are exposed to the impact of interest rate movement 
we have performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis over the near term with a change in interest rates 
based on this analysis  our net income would be impacted by approximately million 
we do not anticipate any material interest rate risk from changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk we generate a percentage of our net income from our foreign operations 
we have performed a foreign exchange sensitivity analysis over the near term with a change in foreign exchange rates 
based on this analysis  our net income would be impacted by approximately million 
we do not anticipate any material foreign exchange rate risk from changes in foreign currency rates 
pension plan we have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which covers substantially all of our united states employees who have met the plan s eligibility provisions as of may  the annual pension expense that we recognize in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  is based on assumptions of key variables including discount rate  rate of increase in compensation levels  and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the selection of assumptions involves significant judgment 
in selecting the long term return on asset and discount rate we consider both 
table of contents current market conditions and expected future market trends  including equity market performance and changes in interest rates 
the investment performance of our pension plan assets for the year ended may  of did not meet our previous long term return on asset assumption under sfas no 
of 
due to changes in the extended outlook of the investment markets  we have reduced the long term return on asset assumption to from effective march  in addition  due to changes in the interest rate environment  we have reduced the discount rate to from effective march  effective july   pension benefits have been frozen based on current compensation levels 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis for changes in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
based on this analysis  a change in the assumed discount rate or return on plan assets would impact our net income by approximately million
