o repair and overhaul aircraft electronic equipment the etg repairs and overhauls inertial navigation systems and other avionics equipment for commercial  military and business aircraft operators 
the company s results of operations during each of the past three fiscal years have been affected by a number of transactions 
this discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein 
for further information regarding the acquisitions and strategic alliances discussed below  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and are included in the company s results of operations from the effective date of acquisition 
during fiscal  the company acquired future aviation  inc for million 
during fiscal  the company acquired analog modules  inc  aero design  inc  avitech engineering corporation  and aviation facilities  inc 
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in addition  the company acquired inertial airline services  inc for million in cash and million in heico class a common stock  shares paid at closing 
the company guaranteed that the resale value of such class a common stock would be at least million through august   which both parties agreed to extend to august  based on the closing market price of heico class a common stock on october   the company would have had to pay the seller an additional amount of approximately million in cash  which would have been recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity 
in addition  subject to meeting certain earnings targets during the first two years following the acquisition  the company may be obligated to pay additional consideration of million in cash 
concurrent with the purchase  the company loaned the seller million  which is due august  and is secured by the  shares of heico class a common stock 
the loan is reflected as a reduction in the equity section of the company s consolidated balance sheet as a note receivable secured by class a common stock 
during fiscal  the company acquired jetseal  inc the purchase price was not significant to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the source of the purchase prices for these acquisitions was primarily from proceeds of the company s credit facility 
had the fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal acquisitions been made at the beginning of their respective fiscal years  the pro forma consolidated results would not have been materially different from the reported results 
in october  the company entered into a strategic alliance with lufthansa technik ag lufthansa  the technical services subsidiary of lufthansa german airlines  whereby lufthansa invested approximately million in heico aerospace  including million paid at closing pursuant to a stock purchase agreement and approximately million paid to heico aerospace pursuant to a research and development cooperation agreement  which has partially funded the accelerated development of additional faa approved replacement parts for jet engines and aircraft components 
the funds received as a result of the research and development cooperation agreement reduced research and development expenses in the periods such expenses were incurred 
in addition  lufthansa and heico aerospace have agreed to cooperate regarding technical services and marketing support for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts on a worldwide basis 
in connection with subsequent acquisitions by heico aerospace  lufthansa invested additional amounts aggregating to approximately million pursuant to its option to maintain a equity interest 
in february  the company entered into a joint venture with amr corporation amr to develop  design and sell faa approved jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts through its subsidiary  heico aerospace 
as part of the joint venture  amr will reimburse heico aerospace a portion of new product research and development costs 
the funds received as a result of the new product research and development costs paid by amr generally reduce new product research and development expenses in the period such expenses are incurred 
the balance of the development costs are incurred by the joint venture  which is owned by amr 
in addition  amr and heico aerospace have agreed to cooperate regarding technical services and marketing support on a worldwide basis 
in september  the company consummated the sale of all of the outstanding capital stock of heico electronic s wholly owned subsidiary  trilectron industries  inc trilectron 
in consideration of the sale of trilectron s capital stock  the company received an aggregate of million in cash and retained certain property having a book value of approximately million  which was sold in fiscal the proceeds from the sale were used to pay down the outstanding balance on the company s credit facility 
the sale of trilectron did not meet the requirements for classification as a discontinued operation in accordance with apb opinion no 
because its activities could not be clearly distinguished  physically and operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the other assets  results of operations  and activities of the etg operating segment of which it was a part 
trilectron was managed as part of the etg and the etg was treated as a single operating segment 
the etg shared facilities  staff  information technology processing and other centrally provided services with no allocation of costs and interest expense between the divisions within the etg 
accordingly  the sale was reported as a sale of a product line and trilectron s results of operations through the date of the closing have been reported in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the sale of trilectron resulted in a pretax gain in fiscal of   or 
per diluted share  net of income tax 
the pretax gain is net of expenses of million directly related to the transaction 
expenses related to the sale included board approved management incentive bonuses  professional service fees  contract indemnification costs  required reserves and miscellaneous costs and expenses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details of expenses related to the sale 
in fiscal  the company recognized an additional pretax gain of   or 
per diluted share  net of income tax on the sale of the trilectron product line due to the elimination of certain of the above reserves upon the expiration of indemnification provisions of the sales contract 
critical accounting policies the company believes that the following are its most critical accounting policies  some of which require management to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized on an accrual basis  primarily upon shipment of products and the rendering of services 
revenue from certain fixed price contracts for which costs can be dependably estimated are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract 
variations in actual labor performance  changes to estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to the cost estimates 
revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the period of revision 
for contracts in which costs cannot be dependably estimated  revenue is recognized on the completed contract method 
a contract is considered complete when all costs except insignificant items have been incurred or the item has been accepted by the customer 
the aggregate effects of changes in estimates relating to inventories and or long term contracts did not have a significant impact on net income and diluted net income per share in fiscal or fiscal changes in estimates increased net income and diluted net income per share by  or 
per diluted share in fiscal as further explained in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
valuation of accounts receivable the valuation of accounts receivable requires that the company set up an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts and record a corresponding charge to bad debt expense 
the company estimates uncollectible receivables based on such factors as its prior experience  its appraisal of a customer s ability to pay  and economic conditions within and outside of the aerospace  defense and electronics industries 
actual bad debt expense could differ from estimates made 
valuation of inventories portions of the inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on the first in  first out basis 
the remaining portions of the inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  on a per contract basis  with estimated total contract costs being allocated ratably to all units 
the effects of changes in estimated total contract costs are recognized in the period determined 
losses  if any  are recognized fully when identified 
the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of inventories  giving consideration to factors such as its physical condition  sales patterns  and expected future demand and estimates a reasonable amount to be provided for slow moving  obsolete or damaged inventory 
these estimates could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements based upon future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive factors that were not foreseen or did not exist when the valuation allowances were established 
valuation of goodwill the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective november  sfas eliminates the amortization of goodwill 
pursuant to sfas  the company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of october or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the test requires the company to compare the fair value of each of its reporting units to its carrying value to determine potential impairment 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of that reporting unit s goodwill is to be calculated and an impairment loss shall be recognized in the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  if any 
the determination of fair value requires the company to make a number of estimates  assumptions and judgments 
if there is a material change in such assumptions used by the company in determining fair value or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  the company could be required to recognize a material impairment charge 
based on the annual goodwill test for impairment as of october   the company determined there is no impairment of its goodwill  which aggregated to million 
results of operations the following table sets forth the results of operations  net sales and operating income by operating segment and the percentage of net sales represented by the respective items including fiscal results as adjusted to exclude the direct results of operations of the trilectron product line 
the company believes fiscal results as adjusted provide more meaningful information in certain cases for comparing the results of operations in fiscal and fiscal accordingly  certain discussion of fiscal results below reflects comparisons to the company s fiscal results as adjusted to exclude the direct results of operations of trilectron 
for the year ended october  as reported as adjusted net sales     cost of sales     selling  general and administrative expenses     total operating costs and expenses     operating income     net sales by segment flight support group     electronic technologies group     intersegment sales  operating income by segment flight support group     electronic technologies group     other  primarily corporate     net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense n a interest and other income n a gain on sale of product line n a income tax expense n a minority interests n a net income n a during fiscal  one of the company s subsidiaries formerly included in the electronic technologies group was reclassified to the flight support group 
prior period results have been retroactively restated to reflect the revised segment classification 
for the fiscal year ended october   operating income as adjusted for the adoption of sfas would have been  including operating income of the flight support group and the electronic technologies group of  and  respectively 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales net sales in fiscal totaled million  up when compared to net sales of million in fiscal the increase reflects higher sales within the etg  which increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  partially offset by lower sales within the fsg  which decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the sales increase within the etg is primarily attributed to revenues resulting from acquisitions as the company expanded its operations to include laser and navigation technologies  partially offset by lower sales of electromagnetic interference emi shielding products to the electronics and communications industries 
the sales decrease within the fsg primarily reflects lower commercial aftermarket parts and services sales as a result of the impact of the september  terrorist attacks and continued weakness within the commercial aviation industry  partially offset by sales from newly acquired businesses 
the fiscal increase in sales attributable to newly acquired businesses of both the etg and the fsg is approximately million 
gross profits and operating expenses the company s gross profit margins averaged in fiscal as compared to in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to lower margins within the fsg attributed to lower sales of higher margin faa approved replacement parts and a million increase in new product research and development expenses over fiscal spending 
the decrease was partially offset by slightly higher gross margins in the etg due primarily to increased sales of higher margin defense related products 
cost of sales in fiscal and fiscal includes approximately million and million  respectively  of new product research and development expenses net of reimbursements pursuant to cooperation and joint venture agreements 
the fiscal year over year increase in new product research and development expenses relates primarily to the development of faa approved replacement parts 
new product development  which is critical to the company s long term growth  reduced diluted earnings per share by approximately 
in fiscal versus fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses is mainly due to the elimination of goodwill amortization as required under sfas  partially offset by additional sg a expenses of newly acquired businesses and professional fees associated with a recently completed income tax audit  which resulted in the recovery of a portion of taxes paid in prior years as further explained below within income tax expense 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization  partially offset by the impact of lower year over year sales  excluding sales from new acquisitions  and the professional fees associated with the recently completed income tax audit 
operating income operating income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  operating income decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in operating income reflects lower operating income within the fsg  which decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  partially offset by higher operating income within the etg  which increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline in operating income as a percentage of sales reflects a decline in the fsg s operating income as a percentage of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in the etg s operating income as a percentage of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in the fsg s operating income as a percentage of sales reflects the lower sales and gross margins discussed above  partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization 
the increase in the etg s operating income as a percentage of sales reflects the higher sales and gross margins discussed above  and the elimination of goodwill amortization 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was principally due to lower interest rates in fiscal  partially offset by a higher weighted average balance outstanding under the company s credit facility in fiscal related to borrowings made during fiscal to fund acquisitions 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased from million in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease is mainly due to the inclusion in fiscal of a gain of  on the sale of property retained in the sale of the trilectron product line sold in fiscal and a realized gain of  on the sale of long term investments 
the decrease also reflects lower investment interest rates and other income in fiscal gain on sale of product line in fiscal  the company recognized an additional pretax gain of   net of tax  or 
per diluted share on the sale of the trilectron product line due to the elimination of certain reserves upon the expiration of indemnification provisions of the sales contract 
income tax expense income tax expense in fiscal reflects the recovery of a portion of taxes paid in prior years resulting from a recently completed income tax audit  which increased net income by million  or 
per diluted share  net of related expenses including professional fees and interest as explained further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the recovery was the principal driver behind the reduction in the company s effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal the elimination of goodwill amortization also contributed to the year over year decline in the effective tax rate 
for a detailed analysis of the provision for income taxes  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
minority interests minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries represents the minority interests held in heico aerospace 
minority interests decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due mainly to the lower earnings within the fsg 
net income the company s net income was million  or 
per diluted share  in fiscal compared to net income of million  or 
per diluted share in fiscal the slightly lower net income in fiscal reflects the lower operating income discussed above  partially offset by the income tax recovery and lower minority interests as discussed above 
net income for fiscal as adjusted on a pro forma basis for the adoption of sfas would have been million  or 
per diluted share 
outlook like most companies supplying the airline industry  the company s fiscal results were negatively impacted by the events of september  coupled with a weak economy as sales to commercial airlines fell after the terrorist attacks 
while the airline industry as a whole struggles to return to profitability  the company is pleased to note that it continues to increase market share and penetration and continues to operate profitably with positive cash flow from operations and free cash flow cash flow from operations less capital expenditures 
further  the company s diversification of its operations beyond the commercial aerospace markets it has historically served has cushioned the impact of the events of september  and the economic softness thereafter 
revenues from the defense industry and other markets  including industrial  medical  electronics and telecommunications  represented approximately one third of the company s total revenues in fiscal with defense customers representing approximately of revenues 
although softness in the airline industry may continue in the foreseeable future  the company believes its products and services offer its customers substantial opportunities for cost savings 
furthermore  the company believes that its strategy of developing new revenue sources and further expanding its markets through both internal growth and acquisitions  combined with a strong balance sheet  will result in long term growth 
the near term impact of the uncertainties within the commercial aviation industry and domestic economy make it difficult for the company to predict its short term sales and earnings 
the company does currently believe  however  that sales and earnings will improve in fiscal relative to fiscal levels 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales net sales in fiscal totaled million  up when compared to fiscal net sales of million as adjusted to exclude trilectron 
the increase in sales for fiscal reflects an increase of million an increase to million from the company s fsg and an increase of million as adjusted a increase to million in revenues from the company s etg 
the fsg sales increase primarily represents revenues resulting from an increase in faa approved pma replacement parts sales and an increase in jet engine and aircraft component repair and overhaul revenues 
pma replacement parts sales in fiscal increased over fiscal primarily as a result of new products while component repair and overhaul revenues increased as a result of the company s entry into the regional and business aviation maintenance repair and overhaul mro market through an acquisition made in fiscal  partially offset by softness in the commercial mro market 
the fsg s sales increase includes additional revenue of million from businesses acquired during fiscal and fiscal the fsg s commercial aerospace operations experienced a decline in sales after the september  terrorist attacks 
the etg s sales increase is primarily attributed to revenues of million resulting from fiscal acquisitions  partially offset by weakness in sales of emi shielding products to the electronics and communications industries reflecting the general economic weakness within some of the technology industries 
gross profits and operating expenses the company s gross profit margins averaged for fiscal as compared to as adjusted for fiscal this decrease reflects lower margins within the fsg contributed by a budgeted increase in new product research and development expenses of million resulting from lower new product research and development reimbursements as discussed below and softness within the commercial component repair and overhaul market  partially offset by the impact of higher pma replacement parts sales 
the decrease also reflects lower margins within the etg as a result of lower sales of higher margin emi shielding products 
cost of sales amounts for fiscal and fiscal include approximately million and million  respectively  of new product research and development expenses of heico aerospace 
these amounts are net of  and  received in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  pursuant to research and development cooperation and joint venture agreements see note to the consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million to million for fiscal from million as adjusted for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased to for fiscal compared to as adjusted for fiscal the increases in sg a expenses and sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales are primarily a result of higher marketing costs in the fsg associated with expanding product lines and a  increase in goodwill amortization primarily resulting from acquisitions 
operating income operating income decreased million to million a decrease for fiscal from million as adjusted for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  operating income decreased from in fiscal as adjusted to in fiscal the decrease in operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales reflects a decrease of million a decrease from million to million in the company s fsg and a decrease of million a decrease from million as adjusted to million in the company s etg 
the fsg s operating income as a percentage of net sales declined from in fiscal to in fiscal while the etg s operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in the fsg s operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was due primarily to the impact of higher pma replacement parts sales discussed above being more than offset by lower gross profit margins reflecting lower new product research and development reimbursements  higher marketing costs and higher goodwill amortization 
operating income for fiscal was also affected by softness in the commercial mro market and the impact of the september  events on commercial airline customers 
the decrease in the etg s operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to lower sales of higher margin emi shielding products discussed above  partially offset by additional earnings from acquisitions 
interest expense interest expense decreased million to million from fiscal to fiscal the decrease was principally due to a decrease in the outstanding debt balances during the period related to repayment of borrowings on the company s credit facility from the proceeds from the sale of trilectron and a decrease in interest rates partially offset by additional borrowings to partially fund acquisitions 
interest and other income interest and other income increased by  to million from fiscal to fiscal due principally to a pretax gain of  realized on the sale of property retained in the sale of trilectron and a realized gain of  on the sale of long term investments 
income tax expense the company s effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  primarily due to a higher tax benefit on export sales partially offset by higher non deductible goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
for a detailed analysis of the provisions for income taxes  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
minority interests minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries represents the minority interests held in heico aerospace 
minority interests decreased  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal mainly due to minority interest income of  representing amr s share in the new product research and development costs incurred within the joint venture 
income from continuing operations the company s income from continuing operations was million  or 
per diluted share  in fiscal income from continuing operations in fiscal was million  or per diluted share  including the impact of the gain on sale of trilectron  which was million 
per diluted share 
the decrease in income from continuing operations is primarily due to the gain on the sale of product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the lower operating income discussed above 
net income the company s net income was million  or 
per diluted share  in fiscal in fiscal  net income was million  or per diluted share  including the impact of the gain on sale of trilectron  which was million 
per diluted share 
the lower net income in fiscal is primarily due to the trilectron gain and the lower operating income discussed above 
trilectron  which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal  contributed approximately 
per diluted share to earnings in fiscal inflation the company has generally experienced increases in its costs of labor  materials and services consistent with overall rates of inflation 
the impact of such increases on the company s net income has been generally minimized by efforts to lower costs through manufacturing efficiencies and cost reductions 
liquidity and capital resources the company generates cash primarily from its operating activities and financing activities  including borrowings under long term credit agreements 
principal uses of cash by the company include acquisitions  payments of interest and principal on debt  capital expenditures and increases in working capital 
the company believes that its operating cash flow and available borrowings under the company s credit facility will be sufficient to fund cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
operating activities cash flow from operations was million for fiscal  principally reflecting net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  deferred income tax provision of million  and a tax benefit related to stock option exercises of million  partially offset by an increase in net operating assets of million 
the increase in net operating assets current assets used in operations net of current liabilities primarily resulted from higher inventories and capitalized tooling costs in the fsg associated with new products 
cash flow from operations was million for fiscal  principally reflecting net income of million  depreciation and amortization and minority interest of million and million  respectively  offset by an increase in net operating assets of million 
the increase in net operating assets current assets used in operations net of current liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in inventories to meet increased pma sales and payment of income taxes of approximately million on the fiscal gain from the sale of trilectron 
cash flow from operations was million in fiscal principally reflecting net income of million  adjustments for gain on sale of product line  depreciation and amortization  minority interest  and tax benefits related to stock option exercises of million  million  million and million  respectively  offset by an increase in net operating assets of million 
the increase in net operating assets primarily resulted from an increase in accounts receivable resulting from extended payment terms  and an increase in inventories to meet increased sales orders under certain etg contracts  as well as increases in income taxes payable and accrued expenses of million and million  respectively  mainly due to the sale of trilectron 
excluding cash flow used in the operations of trilectron prior to its sale  cash flow from operations totaled approximately million in fiscal investing activities cash used in investing activities during the three fiscal year period ended october  was primarily cash used in various acquisitions  including contingent payments  totaling million 
for further details on acquisitions see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures aggregated to million over the last three fiscal years  primarily reflecting the purchases of new facilities and the expansion of existing production facilities and capabilities 
the principal cash provided by investing activities was million and million generated in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as a result of the sale of trilectron in fiscal in addition  the company received proceeds of million in fiscal from the sale of long term investments and property that was held for disposition 
financing activities the company s principal financing source of cash over the past three fiscal years ended october  was proceeds from long term debt of million  including million from the company s credit facility and proceeds from stock option exercises of million 
during this same period  the company repaid million of the outstanding balance on its credit facility and other long term debt and paid cash dividends aggregating to million 
in july  the company entered into a million revolving credit facility credit facility with a bank syndicate  which contains both revolving credit and term loan features 
the credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate needs of the company and to finance acquisitions generally not in excess of million for any single acquisition nor in excess of an aggregate of million for acquisitions during any four fiscal quarter period without the requisite approval of the bank syndicate on a revolving basis through july the company has the option to convert outstanding advances to term loans amortizing over a period through july the company plans to renew or replace this credit facility prior to its july expiration date 
advances under the credit facility accrue interest  at the company s choice of the london interbank offered rate libor or the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate  plus applicable margins based on the company s ratio of total funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the company is required to maintain certain financial covenants  including minimum net worth  limitations on capital expenditures excluding expenditures for the acquisition of businesses and limitations on additional indebtedness 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the credit facility 
new accounting standards in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas develops one accounting model based on the model in sfas for long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale  as well as addresses the principal implementation issues 
sfas requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
that requirement eliminates the requirement of apb that discontinued operations be measured at net realizable value or that entities include under discontinued operations in the financial statements amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
additionally  sfas expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and generally the provisions of the statement will be applied prospectively 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement eliminates the sfas requirement that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item  and requires that such gains and losses be evaluated for extraordinary classification under the criteria of apb this statement also amends sfas  accounting for leases  to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sales leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sales leaseback transactions 
sfas also makes various other technical corrections to existing pronouncements 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred  as opposed to when the entity commits to an exit plan under eitf sfas also establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial measurement of the liability 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from changes in values of financial instruments  including interest rate risk and liquidity risk 
the company engages in transactions in the normal course of business that expose it to market risks 
the primary market risk to which the company has exposure is interest rate risk  mainly related to its revolving credit facility and industrial revenue bonds  which had an aggregate outstanding balance of million at october  interest rates on the revolving credit facility borrowings are based on libor plus a variable margin  while interest rates on the industrial development revenue bonds are based on variable rates 
interest rate risk associated with the company s variable rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates 
based on the outstanding debt balance at october   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would increase the company s interest expense by approximately  in fiscal the company maintains a portion of its cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of these financial instruments  a hypothetical increase in interest rates as of october  would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position
