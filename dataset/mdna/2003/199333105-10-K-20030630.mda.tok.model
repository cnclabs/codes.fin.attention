item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
comments on the results of operations and financial condition below refer to our continuing operations  except in the section entitled discontinued operations 
overview we are a leading manufacturer and marketer of hoists  cranes  chain  conveyors  material handling systems  lift tables and component parts serving a wide variety of commercial and industrial end markets 
our products are used to efficiently and ergonomically move  lift  position or secure objects and loads 
our products segment sells a wide variety of powered and manually operated wire rope and chain hoists  industrial crane systems  chain  hooks and attachments  actuators and rotary unions 
our solutions segment designs  manufactures  and installs application specific material handling systems and solutions for end users to improve work station and facility wide work flow 
founded in  we have grown to our current size and leadership position largely as the result of the businesses we acquired between february and april these acquisitions have significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach  end user markets and customer base 
as a result of these acquisitions and internal growth  our revenues have increased from approximately million in fiscal  the year of our initial public offering  to approximately million in fiscal the operations of our acquired businesses continue to be integrated with our existing businesses 
we converted nearly all of our acquired north american businesses onto our computer system which integrates all of our applications from order entry to production planning to accounting  facilitating company wide information flow 
further acquisition integration activities included cost reductions resulting from internally supplying chain and forged attachments to acquired hoist businesses  consolidating purchasing efforts through our purchasing council  reducing duplicative sales and marketing activities  eliminating redundant administrative headcount and consolidating treasury and accounts receivable functions 
our acquisition integration activities also included revenue enhancements through cross selling of products between existing and acquired businesses 
the current phase of the integration of these businesses includes reducing our excess manufacturing capacity and improving our productivity 
this phase is in progress through our facility rationalization program and lean manufacturing efforts 
the latter phase of these integration activities was delayed for a period of approximately two years  from early through early  due to difficulties encountered with the assimilation of our asi acquisition 
substantially all of the assets of that business  which formerly comprised our solutions automotive segment  were sold in may asi did not prove to be a good fit for us mainly because of the highly volatile nature of its business  its significant dependence on the auto industry and its heavy use of working capital 
despite the fact that the loss associated with that disposition increased our financial leverage  the proceeds furthered our efforts to reduce debt and future interest expense  which has recently been one of our primary objectives 
many of the us industrial sectors that we serve have been impacted by soft economic conditions since mid these conditions deteriorated significantly in our fiscal fourth quarter and continued to decline throughout fiscal and most of fiscal  impacting our net sales and financial performance 
after reaching a historical high of million in fiscal  our net sales declined to million in fiscal  and further by to million in fiscal and by an additional to million in fiscal  primarily due to this downturn in the business cycle 
despite these economic conditions and their impact on our operating results  we maintained our leading market share  generated positive cash flow from operations and repaid million  million and million of debt in fiscal  and  respectively 
our positive cash flow was favorably impacted by our lean manufacturing efforts  which began in fiscal these efforts are fundamentally changing our manufacturing processes  resulting in significant inventory reductions and improving on time delivery and productivity 
results of operations net sales of our products and solutions segments  in millions of dollars and with percentage changes for each segment  were as follows fiscal years ended march  change vs 
change vs 
amount amount products segment solutions segment total net sales sales fluctuations during the periods were primarily due to the downturn in the general north american economy and the industrial sectors in particular 
net sales in fiscal of million decreased by million  or  from fiscal  and net sales in fiscal of million decreased million  or  from fiscal our products segment net sales declined and in fiscal and  respectively  primarily due to decreased unit sales resulting from the soft us industrial markets  offset by million of foreign currency translation gains in fiscal and including million of foreign currency translation losses in fiscal our solutions segment net sales decreased and in fiscal and  respectively 
the declines in fiscal and were primarily due to soft us industrial markets 
the fiscal decline was further impacted by our decision to exit our domestic general contracting business  which had net sales of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit of the products and solutions segments  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of total segment net sales  was as follows fiscal years ended march  amount amount amount products segment solutions segment total gross profit our gross profit margins were approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decreases in gross profit margin for fiscal and were primarily the result of economic and inventory reduction factors 
the product segment s gross profit margin decreased in fiscal due to the following factors i our price increase implementation was delayed eight months until august due to economic market conditions approximately million impact  ii cost increases  particularly for employee benefits such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance and pension and also general property insurance approximately million impact  iii pricing pressure  especially on our capital type products such as cranes approximately million impact  iv the decline in net sales and the resulting decrease in absorption of fixed production costs  v production at levels lower than sales levels to reduce inventories and the resulting further decrease in absorption of fixed production costs  vi production inefficiencies at our facilities impacted by facility rationalization activities  and vii a million reclassification of certain crane builder expenses to cost of products sold from general and administrative expenses in fiscal the gross profit margin in our products segment decreased in fiscal due to the decrease in net sales and resulting decrease in production cost absorption  the lack of a general price increase to offset inflationary costs  especially insurance costs  and a million reclassification of certain crane builder expenses to cost of products sold from general and administrative expenses in fiscal the solutions segment s gross profit margin decreased in fiscal primarily due to the decline in net sales and resulting decease in absorption of fixed production costs  increased employee benefits costs as described above and an increase in larger integrated solutions projects which carry a lower gross profit margin overall 
the gross profit margin in our solutions segment increased in fiscal despite the decrease in net sales and the resulting decrease in production cost absorption 
this increase was primarily attributable to weak margins in fiscal selling expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal increase includes million resulting from the strength of the us dollar relative to european currencies upon translation of european operating results into us dollars for reporting purposes  million resulting from reclassification of certain crane builder expenses from general and administrative expenses in fiscal to improve reporting consistency  million for investing in new geographic markets and other cost increases for employee benefits costs  catalogs  and commissions in certain markets  partially offset by cost control measures 
the fiscal reduction reflects cost control efforts due to soft economic conditions as well as the variable nature of some expenses  particularly commissions  travel expenses and sales office costs 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the expense reductions resulted from general discretionary cost control measures  million reduction in product liability expense due to reassessment of self insurance exposure relative to certain claims and the reclassification of million and million of crane builder expenses into cost of products sold or selling expense in fiscal and  respectively  partially offset by million in fiscal for professional fees for special projects to improve the company s organization structure  million in fiscal for intercompany exchange losses  million in fiscal for increased accounts receivable write offs  and fiscal included sales office expansions into new geographic regions 
restructuring charges of million and million  or and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively  were attributable to the closure or significant reorganization of thirteen manufacturing or warehouse facilities 
the following facilities were closed  merged or significantly reorganized beginning in fiscal abingdon  va  tonawanda  ny  cobourg  ontario  canada  forest park  il  and reform  al 
all operations except for the tonawanda facility were included within our products segment  and all activities were relocated into other existing company facilities within their respective segments 
charges include exit costs of million for severance relating to approximately employees and million of lease termination  facility wind down  preparation for sale and maintenance of non operating facilities prior to disposal 
three of the five projects were completed as planned in the fourth quarter while two are on schedule to be completed by the second quarter of fiscal the following facilities were closed  merged or significantly reorganized beginning in fiscal houma  la  woodland  ca  romeoville  il  forrest city  ar  monterrey  mexico  hobro  denmark  atlanta  ga  and richmond  british columbia  canada 
all operations except for the hobro facility were included within our products segment  and all activities were relocated into other existing company facilities within their respective segments 
charges include exit costs of million for severance relating to approximately employees and million of lease termination  facility wind down  preparation for sale and maintenance of non operating facilities prior to disposal 
included in the restructuring charges was approximately million to terminate a facility lease  resulting in the purchase of the property with an estimated fair value of approximately million which was recorded as an offset to the restructuring charges 
due to changes in the real estate market and a reassessment of the fair value of the property  the net asset held for sale was adjusted by million as a further restructuring charge during fiscal in addition  costs for ongoing maintenance of the non operating facility was reassessed in fiscal resulting in an additional million restructuring charge 
all of the projects were completed as planned during fiscal the remaining liability relates to the ongoing maintenance costs of the non operating facility 
each project was analyzed based on our capacity and the cost structure of the specific facilities relative to others 
as a result of these rationalization projects we expect to achieve approximately million to million of annualized savings primarily in cost of products sold including facility fixed costs and employee costs  of which approximately million has been realized during fiscal and approximately million is anticipated in fiscal we anticipate that our restructuring charges for fiscal in connection with our ongoing facility rationalization and reorganization initiatives will be between million and million 
write off amortization of intangibles was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal reflected a million goodwill write off in the fourth quarter relating to impairment under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which pronouncement eliminated the requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets beginning in fiscal but added new impairment testing rules 
the fiscal and amounts relate primarily to non tax deductible goodwill amortization 
interest and debt expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  interest and debt expense was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal increase included a million write off of deferred financing costs associated with the company s former credit facility  which was replaced with a new credit arrangement in november  a portion of which carries higher effective interest rates than the company s former credit facility 
the fiscal decrease was the result of a paydown of senior bank debt of million and a reduction in interest rates 
other income and expense  net was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the income in fiscal included a million gain on the sale of assets held for sale  a million realized gain on certain marketable securities held by our captive insurance company for settlement of a portion of our general and products liability claims  offset by a million unrealized  non cash  mark to market loss recognized within that same securities portfolio and a million loss on the march sale of a small subsidiary 
the unrealized loss within the securities portfolio was recognized since it was deemed to be other than temporary in nature  resulting from unrealized losses that existed longer than a six month period 
the expense in fiscal similarly included a million unrealized  non cash  mark to market loss recognized on marketable securities held by our captive insurance subsidiary  a million loss on the january sale of a small subsidiary  and a million gain on the sale of assets held for sale 
the fiscal income is primarily due to net realized gains on the sale of marketable securities by our captive insurance subsidiary as described above 
income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes were not meaningful in fiscal or and were in fiscal the fiscal percentage reflects the effect of non deductible goodwill amortization resulting from business acquisitions  offset by the impact of tax credits and other tax items 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we reduced goodwill by million as of the beginning of fiscal  reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on our statement of operations 
a discounted cash flows approach was used to test goodwill for potential impairment 
liquidity and capital resources in november  we refinanced our credit facilities 
the new arrangement replaced our previous revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on march  the new arrangement consists of a revolving credit facility  a term loan and a senior second secured term loan 
the revolving credit facility provides availability up to a maximum of million through march  availability based on the underlying collateral at march  amounted to million  of which million was blocked and designated for repayment of the term loans 
the unused revolving credit facility totaled million at that date  net of outstanding borrowings of million  outstanding letters of credit of million and other reserve holdbacks of million 
interest is payable at varying eurodollar rates based on libor or prime plus a spread determined by our leverage ratio  amounting to or basis points  respectively  at march  or 
the term loan  which is also due on march  and is prepayable without penalty  amortizes quarterly over a seven year amortization period beginning april   in quarterly installments of  at march   million was outstanding under the term loan 
interest is payable at varying eurodollar rates based on libor plus a spread determined by our leverage ratio  amounting to basis points at march  
the revolving credit facility and term loan are secured by all of our tangible and intangible assets in the us and canada limited to for stock ownership of foreign subsidiaries 
as of march   million was outstanding on the senior second secured term loan  of which million is due on may  and million is due on november  that facility has no scheduled amortization and is prepayable at our option without penalty  upon approval by our term loan lenders and subject to an availability block and excess availability requirements under our revolving credit facility 
interest is payable at in the first year and increases annually for the three succeeding years at a rate of per year 
in addition  payment in kind interest is also due annually at a rate of through may  and thereafter 
payment in kind interest is payable in cash on each anniversary date of the debt instrument 
if certain repayment thresholds are met under the term loan or the senior second secured term loan prior to december   the payment in kind interest rate would revert back to 
the senior second secured term loan is also subject to a annual fee 
this facility is secured by a secondary interest in all of our tangible and intangible assets in the us and canada limited to for stock ownership of foreign subsidiaries 
the revolving credit agreement  term loan and senior second secured term loan place certain debt covenant restrictions on us  including financial requirements and a restriction on dividend payments 
effective june   the credit agreements were amended to modify one of the covenant restrictions and to provide more flexibility  increasing the payment in kind rate to and placing a million permanent availability block against the revolving credit facility 
our senior subordinated notes issued on march  amounted to million  net of original issue discount of million  and are due march  interest is payable semi annually based on an effective rate of  considering million of proceeds from rate hedging in advance of the placement 
provisions of the notes include  without limitation  restrictions on liens  indebtedness  asset sales and dividends and other restricted payments 
prior to april   the notes were redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at the make whole price as defined in the indenture for the notes 
on or after april   they are redeemable at prices declining annually from to on and after april  in the event of a change of control as defined  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof 
the notes are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash flows  and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and budgeted capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
this belief is dependent upon a steady economy and successful execution of our current business plan which is focused on cash generation for debt repayment 
the business plan includes continued implementation of lean manufacturing  facility rationalization projects  possible divestiture of excess facilities and certain non strategic operations  and improving working capital components  including inventory reductions 
on april   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which requires companies to carry all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
our use of derivative instruments is limited to cash flow hedges  as defined in sfas no 
 of certain interest rate risks 
in order to provide interest rate risk protection  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in june to effectively convert million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the million interest rate swap agreement matures in june net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the million decrease in fiscal relative to fiscal was due to weaker operating performance in fiscal and to working capital changes 
in particular  trade accounts receivable and inventories provided cash of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and trade accounts payable used million of cash in fiscal but provided million of cash in fiscal the million increase in fiscal was the result of a fiscal reduction in working capital components  especially inventory  despite decreased income from continuing operations 
operating assets net of liabilities provided cash of million in fiscal  provided cash of million in fiscal and used cash of million in fiscal net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal and used in investing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal amount included million of proceeds from business divestitures 
the fiscal  and amounts included million  million and million  respectively  of proceeds from sales of a portion of land included in net assets held for sale 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
those amounts included million  million and million of debt repayment in fiscal  and  respectively  as well as million million of dividends paid in fiscal and  respectively 
we also paid million of financing costs in fiscal to amend our prior credit agreements and to effect the refinancing of our debt in november capital expenditures in addition to keeping our current equipment and plants properly maintained  we are committed to replacing  enhancing and upgrading our property  plant and equipment to reduce production costs  increase flexibility to respond effectively to market fluctuations and changes  meet environmental requirements  enhance safety and promote ergonomically correct work stations 
further  our facility rationalization program currently in progress reduces our annual capital expenditure requirements and also provides for transfers of equipment from the rationalized facilities to other operating facilities 
our capital expenditures for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the decreased spending in fiscal and reflects a deferral of certain projects due to soft market conditions  as well as reduced needs resulting from our facility rationalization program 
the higher level of spending in fiscal also reflects the effect of our decision to purchase real estate that was previously leased 
inflation and other market conditions our costs are affected by inflation in the us economy and  to a lesser extent  in foreign economies including those of europe  canada  mexico and the pacific rim 
we do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases 
however  employee benefits costs such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance  pensions as well as energy and business insurance have exceeded general inflation levels 
in the future  we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases 
seasonality and quarterly results our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders  periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations  restructuring charges and other costs attributable to our facility rationalization program  divestitures  acquisitions and the magnitude of acquisition integration costs 
therefore  our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year 
discontinued operations in may  we completed the divestiture of substantially all of the assets of asi which comprised the principal business unit in our former solutions automotive segment 
proceeds from this sale included cash of million and an subordinated note in the principal amount of million payable over years 
accordingly  the asi operation was reflected as discontinued operations in our financial statements and all prior financial statements have been restated 
the income loss from discontinued operations was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the fluctuations were primarily due to the volatility of the automobile industry and the asi operation s dependence on certain significant customers 
the loss on the sale of the discontinued operations was million and was reflected in our fiscal statement of operations 
cash used by discontinued operations was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates 
we have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements 
other accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are disclosed in notes and  respectively  to our consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs 
the pension discount rate assumptions of and as of march  and  respectively  are based on long term bond rates 
the decrease in discount rate for fiscal resulted in a million increase in the projected benefit obligation as of march  the rate of return on plan assets assumptions of and for the year ended march  and  respectively  are based on the composition of the asset portfolios approximately equities and fixed income and their long term historical returns 
the actual assets sustained losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  contributing to an unrecognized actuarial loss of million as of march  these factors contributed to a million increase in accrued pension cost as of march  compared to march  with a million offset to the minimum pension liability adjustment within shareholders equity and a million increase in the associated deferred tax asset 
the unrecognized actuarial loss will result in future pension expense increases 
pension expense for the march  fiscal year is expected to increase by approximately million over fiscal these factors will also result in increases in funding requirements over time  unless there is significant market appreciation in the asset values 
however  pension funding contributions for the march  fiscal year are expected to decrease by approximately million compared to fiscal the compensation increase assumption of as of march  and is based on historical trends 
the healthcare inflation assumptions of and for fiscal and  respectively are based on anticipated trends 
healthcare costs in the united states have increased substantially over the last several years 
if this trend continues  the cost of postretirement healthcare will increase in future years 
insurance reserves 
our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in note to our consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims  and assumptions including emergence patterns  payment patterns  initial expected losses and increased limit factors 
other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained 
inventory and accounts receivable reserves 
slow moving and obsolete inventory reserves are judgmentally determined based on historical and expected future usage within a reasonable timeframe 
we reassess trends and usage on a regular basis and if we identify changes we revise our estimated allowances 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on historical bad debt write offs and credit memos issued  assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable agings 
long lived assets 
property  plants and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives 
these assets as well as goodwill are also periodically measured for impairment 
the assigned lives and the projected cash flows used to test impairment are subjective 
if actual lives are shorter than anticipated or if future cash flows are less than anticipated  we could incur a future impairment charge or a loss on disposal relating to these assets 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
as of march   the company had million of total gross deferred tax assets 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  these assets relate principally to liabilities including employee benefit plans  insurance reserves  accrued vacation and incentive costs and also to asset valuation reserves such as inventory obsolescence reserves and bad debt reserves and to capital loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance of million was recorded at march  due to the uncertainty of whether the company s capital loss carryforwards may ultimately be realized million resulted from the disposition of several subsidiaries and expires at march   million resulted from the sale of the company s equity investments and expires at march  
our ability to realize our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income 
if we do not generate sufficient taxable income  we would record an additional valuation allowance 
effects of new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations in june sfas no 
eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and modifies the application of the purchase accounting method 
the elimination of the pooling of interests method is effective for transactions initiated after june  the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in june of sfas no 
eliminates the current requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  addresses the amortization of intangible assets with a defined life and the impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas no 
applies to goodwill and intangible assets arising from transactions completed before and after the effective date 
this statement was adopted as of april   resulting in an million transition charge reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and we stopped amortizing goodwill in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million goodwill write off due to impairment within one of our reporting units  recorded within income from operations 
the impairment was the result of a deterioration in the fair value of that business unit 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in august sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
the statement  while retaining many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of sfas no 
 changes the criteria to be met to classify an asset as held for sale as well as the grouping of long lived assets and liabilities that represent the unit of accounting for a long lived asset to be held and used 
sfas no 
was effective for our fiscal year beginning april  and had no impact on our fiscal consolidated financial statements 
the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in june the statement nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the statement changes the requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost as defined was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
under sfas no 
 a liability for an exit cost or disposal activity is recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that were initiated after december  this statement resulted in the delayed recognition of approximately million of restructuring charges associated with our rationalization and reorganization projects that were in progress during the fourth quarter of fiscal and will be completed in fiscal factors affecting our operating results our business is cyclical and is affected by industrial economic conditions  and we are currently experiencing substantially reduced demand for our products 
many of the end users of our products are in highly cyclical industries  such as general manufacturing and construction  that are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions 
their demand for our products  and thus our results of operations  is directly related to the level of production in their facilities  which changes as a result of changes in general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control 
in fiscal years and  for example  we experienced significantly reduced demand for our products  generally as a result of the global economic slowdown  and more specifically as a result of the dramatic decline in capital goods spending in the industries in which our end users operate 
these lower levels of demand resulted in a decline in net sales from fiscal to fiscal  from approximately million to approximately million 
this decline in net sales resulted in a decline in our income from operations during the same period 
we have not seen a significant improvement in demand for our products in in addition  our annual price increase implementation  scheduled for december  was delayed for eight months due to weak economic conditions 
if the current downturn continues or if there is further deterioration in the general economy or in the industries we serve  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be further adversely affected 
in addition  the cyclical nature of our business could at times also adversely affect our liquidity and ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
if demand for our products deteriorates further  the cost saving efforts we have implemented may not be sufficient to achieve the benefits we expect 
in fiscal  we continued our facility rationalization and lean manufacturing programs in an ongoing effort to reduce our cost structure 
if the economy does not improve or deteriorates further  our sales could continue to decline 
if sales are lower than our expectations  our cost saving programs may not achieve the benefits we expect 
we may be forced to take additional cost savings steps that could result in additional charges and materially affect our ability to compete or implement our business strategies 
we rely in large part on independent distributors for sales of our products 
we depend on independent distributors to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers 
distributors play a significant role in determining which of our products are stocked at the branch locations  and hence are most readily accessible to aftermarket buyers  and the price at which these products are sold 
almost all of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our customers 
we do not have written agreements with our distributors located in the united states 
the loss of a substantial number of these distributors or an increase in the distributors sales of our competitors products to our ultimate customers could materially reduce our sales and profits 
we are subject to currency fluctuations from our international sales 
our products are sold in many countries around the world 
thus  a portion of our revenues approximately million in fiscal year is generated in foreign currencies  including principally the euro and the canadian dollar  while a portion of the costs incurred to generate those revenues are incurred in other currencies 
since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had  and will continue to have  an impact on our earnings 
we currently do not have exchange rate hedges in place to reduce the risk of an adverse currency exchange movement 
currency fluctuations may impact our financial performance in the future 
our international operations pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings 
we have operations and assets located outside of the united states  primarily in canada  mexico  germany  denmark  france and china 
in addition  we import a portion of our hoist product line from china and japan  and sell our products to distributors located in approximately countries 
in fiscal year  approximately of our net sales were derived from non us markets 
these international operations are subject to a number of special risks  in addition to the risks of our domestic business  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  differing protections of intellectual property  trade barriers  labor unrest  exchange controls  regional economic uncertainty  differing and possibly more stringent labor regulation  risk of governmental expropriation  domestic and foreign customs and tariffs  current and changing regulatory environments  difficulty in obtaining distribution support  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differences in the availability and terms of financing  political instability and risks of increases in taxes 
also  in some foreign jurisdictions we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met 
these factors may adversely affect our future profits 
part of our strategy is to expand our worldwide market share and reduce costs by strengthening our international distribution capabilities and sourcing basic components in foreign countries  in particular in mexico and china 
implementation of this strategy may increase the impact of the risks described above  and we cannot assure you that such risks will not have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our business is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce our sales  earnings and profitability 
the principal markets that we serve within the material handling industry are fragmented and highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on performance  functionality  price  brand recognition  customer service and support  and product availability 
our competition in the markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes  some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to us  which could reduce our gross margins and net income 
the greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions 
certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product or service innovations that could put us at a disadvantage 
in addition  some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate  including crane building 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers of material handling equipment  we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 
there can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably  that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers  that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets 
our products involve risks of personal injury and property damage  which exposes us to potential liability 
our business exposes us to possible claims for personal injury or death and property damage resulting from the products that we sell 
we maintain insurance through a combination of self insurance retentions and excess insurance coverage 
we monitor claims and potential claims of which we become aware and establish accrued liability reserves for the self insurance amounts based on our liability estimates for such claims 
we cannot give any assurance that existing or future claims will not exceed our estimates for self insurance or the amount of our excess insurance coverage 
in addition  we cannot give any assurance that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or that our insurers would not require us to increase our self insurance amounts 
claims brought against us that are not covered by insurance or that result in recoveries in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition 
our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in steel prices 
we may not be able to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers 
the principal raw material used in our specialty chain  forging and crane building operations is steel 
the steel industry as a whole is highly cyclical  and at times pricing can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control  including general economic conditions  labor costs  competition  import duties  tariffs and currency exchange rates 
recently  the market price of steel has increased significantly 
this volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs 
in an environment of increasing raw material prices  competitive conditions will determine how much of the steel price increases we can pass on to our customers 
to the extent we are unable to pass on any price increases to our customers  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we depend on our senior management team and the loss of any member could adversely affect our operations 
our success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team 
the loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract  retain and maintain additional personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed 
we have not entered into employment agreements with any of our senior management personnel 
we are subject to various environmental laws which may require us to expend significant capital and incur substantial cost 
our operations and facilities are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign requirements relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing the discharges of pollutants in the air and water  the generation  management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures to comply with such requirements 
violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws and regulations  or changes in such laws and regulations such as the imposition of more stringent standards for discharges into the environment  could result in substantial costs to us  including operating costs and capital expenditures  fines and civil and criminal sanctions  third party claims for property damage or personal injury  clean up costs or costs relating to the temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations 
certain of our facilities have been in operation for many years  and we have remediated contamination at some of our facilities 
over time  we and other predecessor operators of such facilities have generated  used  handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes 
additional environmental liabilities could exist  including clean up obligations at these locations or other sites at which materials from our operations were disposed  which could result in substantial future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could reduce our profits or have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
we could pursue selected divestitures which would impact future sales  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
our strategy is to exit businesses that i are not integrated  either operationally or through sales and marketing  with the rest of our company  ii have market channels and customers different from the business of our core products segment  iii are not designated as recipients of significant investment of corporate resources in the foreseeable future  or iv have had  and are expected to continue to have  low returns on our investment of financial and management resources 
for example  in fiscal  we sold our asi and lico steel businesses after determining that they did not meet our criteria for continuing investment 
we periodically review our businesses and are currently evaluating strategic alternatives for our duff norton  societe d exploitation des raccords gautier  positech  american lifts  lister chain forge  cm shredder  larco industrial services and univeyor businesses 
in the aggregate  these businesses generated fiscal sales and ebitda of million and million  respectively 
divestiture of some or all of such businesses would affect future sales  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
we are exposed to various market risks  including commodity prices for raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we may enter into financial instrument transactions  which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel 
we control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of our products 
we have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions 
we manufacture our products in the united states  canada  germany  denmark  the united kingdom  mexico  france and china and sell our products and solutions in over countries 
our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  european currencies and the mexican peso 
for example  when the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar  the value of our net sales and net income denominated in canadian dollars decreases when translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income 
in addition  the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we currently have not invested in derivative instruments  such as foreign exchange contracts  to hedge foreign currency transactions 
we control risk related to changes in interest rates by structuring our debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates and by periodically entering into financial instrument transactions as appropriate 
at march   we had one interest rate swap agreement in effect which converts million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
this swap agreement matures in june and will not be renewed 
we do not have any other swap agreements or similar financial instruments in place 
including the effect of our existing swap agreement  at march  and  approximately and  respectively  of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates 
at those dates  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of outstanding variable rate debt 
a fluctuation in interest rates in fiscal and would have changed interest expense on that outstanding variable rate debt by approximately million and million  respectively
