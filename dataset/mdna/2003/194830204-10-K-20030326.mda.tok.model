discontinued operations proceeds from discontinued operations in were million  representing recoveries  net of cash outflows 
however  the company has significant obligations related to post retirement  casualty  environmental  product liability  lease and other liabilities of discontinued operations 
the nature of many of these contingent liabilities is such that they are difficult to quantify and uncertain in terms of amount 
the company has accrued million for post retirement costs and million for environmental and product liability costs 
based upon the information available to management and the company s experience to date  the company believes that these liabilities will not have a material effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  the company has primary  excess and umbrella insurance coverage for various periods that the company expects to cover certain of these liabilities 
however  there can be no assurances that contingent liabilities will not arise or that known contingent liabilities or related claims will not exceed the company s expectations or that insurance will be available to cover these liabilities 
because the

stock repurchase plan at december   approximately million remained authorized by the company s board of directors to repurchase shares of the company s common stock at management s discretion 
the company believes it has sufficient liquidity under its existing credit arrangements to effect the repurchase program 
the company made no repurchases for the years ended and accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of 
table of contents the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
considerable judgment is often involved in making these determinations  the use of different assumptions could result in significantly different results 
management believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate  however actual results could differ from those estimates 
goodwill impairment testing during the second quarter of  the company completed the implementation of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized 
instead  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas the company employed a discounted cash flow analysis and a market comparable approach in conducting its impairment tests 
the company completed its initial impairment test in the second quarter of and recorded an impairment loss of million having no tax impact  or per average basic and diluted share relating to the uk plastics business in the european and rest of world automotive systems segment 
the impairment loss was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and  therefore  is accounted for as if it occurred on january  the company completed this test again as of november  which indicated that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values 
fair value was determined based upon the discounted cash flows of the reporting units using discount rates ranging from to dependant on the reporting unit and a residual growth rate of 
the market comparable approach consisted of an earnings multiple of times forecasted ebitda operating income less interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and a control premium on equity 
future cash flows and ebitda are affected by future operating performance  which will be impacted by economic conditions  car builds  financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond the companies control 
the north american plastics reporting unit can be significantly impacted by an adverse change in assumptions 
realization of deferred tax assets assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires significant judgment 
the fact that a benefit may be expected for a portion but not all of a deferred tax asset increases the judgmental complexity 
future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period under the tax law 
during  heartland acquired approximately percent of the outstanding shares of the company 
this constituted a change in control that results in annual limitations on the company s use of its nols and unused tax credits 
this annual limitation on the use of nols and tax credits depends on the value of the equity of the company and the amount of built in gain or built in loss in the company s assets at the date of the change in control 
based on the expiration dates of the nols and tax credits as well as anticipated levels of domestic income  management does not believe that the transaction will have a material impact on these deferred tax assets 
management has reviewed the company s operating results for recent years as well as the outlook for its continuing operations and concluded that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of million at december  will be realized 
management took into consideration  among other factors  the expected impact of acquisitions  the impact of recent restructuring plans  and the infusion of cash from heartland 
these factors along with the timing of the reversal of its temporary differences  certain tax planning strategies and the expiration date of its nols were also considered in reaching this conclusion 
the company s ability to generate future taxable income is dependent on numerous factors  including general economic conditions  the state of the automotive industry and other factors beyond management s control 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the company will meet its expectation of future taxable income 
pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions annual net periodic expense and benefit liabilities under our defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis 
assumptions used in the actuarial calculations have a significant impact on plan obligations and expense 
each september  the company reviews the actual experience compared to the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to the assumptions  if warranted 
the healthcare trend rates are reviewed with the actuaries based upon the results of their review of claims experience 
discount rates are based upon an expected benefit payments duration analysis and the equivalent average yield rate for high quality fixed income investments 

table of contents pension benefits are funded through deposits with trustees and the expected long term rate of return on fund assets is based upon actual historical returns modified for known changes in the market and any expected change in investment policy 
postretirement benefits are not funded and our policy is to pay these benefits as they become due 
certain accounting guidance  including the guidance applicable to pensions  does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between actual and assumed experience or the revision of an estimate 
this approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted 
although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements  disclosure of the net amount is disclosed as an unrecognized gain or loss in the footnotes to our financial statements 
the company expects to incur approximately million of pension expense in see note employee benefit plans for additional discussion for the impact on income

such liability may include  for example  investigation and clean up of the contamination  personal injury and property damage caused by the contamination  and damages to natural resources 
some of these liabilities may be imposed without regard to fault  and may also be joint and several which can result in a liable party being held responsible for the entire obligation  even where other parties are also liable 
management believes that it has obtained  and is in material compliance with  those material environmental permits and approvals necessary to conduct the company s various businesses 
environmental compliance costs for continuing businesses are accounted for as normal operating expenses or capital expenditures  except for certain costs incurred at acquired locations 
environmental compliance costs relating to conditions existing at the time of an acquisition are generally charged to reserves established in purchase accounting 
the company accrues for environmental remediation costs when such obligations are known and reasonably estimable

in estimating the cost of investigation and remediation  the company has considered  among other things  prior experience in remediating contaminated sites  remediation efforts by other parties  data released by the united states environmental protection agency usepa  the professional judgment of the company s environmental experts  outside environmental specialists and other experts  and the likelihood that other identified prps will have the financial resources to fulfill their obligations at sites where they and the company may be jointly and severally liable 
it is difficult to estimate the total cost of investigation and remediation due to various factors including incomplete information regarding particular sites and other prps  uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of environmental problems and the company s share  if any  of liability for such problems  the ultimate selection among alternative approaches by governmental regulators
