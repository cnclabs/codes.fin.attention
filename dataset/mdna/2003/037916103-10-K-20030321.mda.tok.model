overview applied innovation inc applied innovation  ai  or the company is a network management solutions company that simplifies and enhances the operation of complex  distributed voice and data networks 
building on a deep knowledge of network architecture  elements and management  ai delivers unique hardware  software and service solutions that provide greater connectivity  visibility and control of network elements and the systems that support them 
the company s largest customers are the four rbocs  other large domestic and foreign phone companies and certain clecs 
the turmoil in the telecommunications market is well into its third year 
facing declining revenues caused by weak demand for local lines and increased competition from cable  wireless and satellite  incumbent telecommunications service providers have repeatedly reduced planned capital spending  have laid off workers  and some have gone into bankruptcy proceedings and or ceased operations 
the spending cutbacks have affected the company through reduced product orders  even by our largest and most financially secure rboc customers 
likewise  demand for the company s installation services decreased substantially during the last year 
applied innovation s products and services help its customers to improve network quality and uptime and  at the same time  reduce network maintenance and repair costs 
as such  the company s products and services are largely discretionary in nature and its customers can temporarily postpone purchases 
the company believes its customers will increase spending on its products and services once the telecommunications market stabilizes so they can take advantage of the network quality and cost saving characteristics of the company s offerings 
the company does not believe it has lost any significant market share during the last two years  despite the reduction in sales it has experienced 
over the past two years  applied innovation responded to declining sales prospects with a number of cost reduction actions  including a significant staff reduction in the third quarter of overall operating costs were reduced over the last two years through staffing reductions and other cost cutting efforts 
as a result  operating costs were reduced to a level appropriate for near term sales prospects and  in the fourth quarter  resulted in the company s lowest quarterly operating expenses in four years 
although industry conditions appear more stable than they did at this time last year  announcements from large domestic service providers indicate that capital spending will be flat or slightly down compared to the company believes that in the long term and possibly as early as the end of  domestic service providers will increase spending on network management equipment and the company s product sales will increase 
the company expects to release new products in late which will enhance its ability to capitalize on the eventual recovery in our core market 
to help diversify its customer base and sales prospects  the company has been aggressively expanding its international distribution capabilities over the last two years and in completed an acquisition targeting the wireless network management market 
additionally  the company has modified its service sales focus  targeting higher margin network management system nms integration projects  while decreasing its field installation activities 
during  the company will continue to pursue us government communication business  an effort started in which resulted in several promising field trials in late and early comparison of to sales for the year ended december  were  a decrease from the prior year s sales of  the prior year s sales included  of integration sales from early which the company identified at the time as non recurring in nature 
excluding the impact of the non recurring integration sales  sales decreased from the previous year 
the overall decrease in sales was primarily attributable to the ongoing capital spending reductions throughout the telecommunications industry by the large domestic service providers  including the rbocs  who comprise the majority of the company s sales 
domestic sales decreased  or  from the prior year and comprised of total sales in versus in the company continued to target international sales opportunities in  resulting in international sales of  a increase over the previous year 
as a percentage of total sales  international sales increased to in versus in gross profit as a percentage of total sales was for the year ended december  as compared to in the prior year 
factors contributing to the overall decrease were i lower product margins as a result of additional inventory charges taken during the year  ii lower sales volumes resulting in lower coverage of fixed manufacturing costs  and iii changes in product sales mix 
partially offsetting the decrease in product margins  however  were increased services margins based primarily on changes in the mix of services sales 
the company shifted its services focus towards higher margin nms services and away from lower margin installation services 
also offsetting the decline in current year product margins was the lack of low margin integration sales in the following table summarizes sales and gross profit for products  integration and services products integration services total year ended december  sales    gross profit    gross profit year ended december  sales     gross profit     gross profit product sales of  were of total sales in  versus product sales of  or  of total sales in this represented a decrease in product sales in from  due largely to the industry wide reduction in capital spending 
product sales include revenues from the sales of aiswitch tm  aiscout tm and other products  as well as third party hardware and software licensing revenues 
gross profit on product sales was for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
product sales margins were negatively impacted by several factors during first  overall decreased sales volumes resulted in lower product margins due to lower absorption of certain fixed manufacturing costs 
second  product sales in included increased sales of third party equipment associated with nms deployments 
sales of such third party equipment generally yield lower margins than the company s core products 
third  the company recorded inventory charges in excess of  during which were charged to cost of goods sold 
the charges related primarily to the company s discontinuance of its optical transmission product line based on the lack of investment in new optical network capacity by the major service providers 
the charges also related to potential excess inventory and market price exposure associated with certain other materials in inventory 
the company had no integration sales in  compared to  or of total sales in the integration sales in  consisting of turnkey integrated systems and including a significant amount of third party products integrated with the company s products  were attributable to the sale of an integrated solution to one large customer and were identified as non recurring at the time of sale 
since the first quarter of  the company has had no additional integration sales 
services sales of  were of total sales  versus services sales of  or  of total sales 
the decrease in services sales from was primarily attributable to decreased demand for installation services  consistent with the overall decrease in product sales from the prior year and consistent with the overall reduced spending in the industry 
the company s nms consulting and services sales increased during the year while sales from extended maintenance agreements were consistent with the prior year 
services sales include revenues from network planning and design  installation  project management  engineering services  training and maintenance 
gross profit on services sales was for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit on service sales in was primarily attributable to the reduction of lower margin installation work  the reduction in the number of installation technicians as part of the cost cutting efforts and an increased mix of higher margin nms services sales 
because of the company s concentration of sales to rbocs  long distance phone companies and large clecs  a small number of customers have historically comprised a substantial portion of the company s sales 
sales to three customers comprised of sales in  with each contributing between and of sales 
in  sales to four customers comprised of sales 
because of the direct correlation and relative importance of these significant customers capital spending patterns to the company  deviations from historical spending levels could significantly impact the company s future operating results 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to  in from  in as a percentage of total sales  this represented in and in the decrease in sg a spending was primarily attributable to overall reductions in staffing including the elimination of five senior management positions  bonuses and commissions  advertising and trade show expenditures  travel expenses and other discretionary spending 
the increase in sg a spending as a percentage of total sales was primarily a result of lower total sales in than in the company expects total sg a expenses to decrease compared to  primarily as a result of the reduced staffing and other cost saving measures enacted 
likewise  sg a spending as a percentage of total sales is expected to decline in as compared to research and development r d expenses were  in and  in as a percentage of total sales  this represented for and for the decrease in r d expenses was primarily attributable to decreased staffing costs and reduced expenditures on hardware  materials and parts  as well as reductions in other discretionary spending 
the company narrowed its r d focus to concentrate more on those projects in its core telecommunications market with the greatest strategic value and market potential 
the increase in r d expenses as a percentage of total sales was primarily a result of lower total sales in than in while the company plans to continue to invest in product enhancements and new product development  it expects r d spending to decrease compared to  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total sales 
the company recorded non recurring charges to operating expenses of  during to account for total workforce reductions of approximately employees  throughout all departments 
the restructuring charges were incurred as a result of two restructuring events in the first restructuring  occurring in the first quarter of  resulted in total charges of  relating primarily to severance and fringe benefits associated with the termination of approximately employees 
the second restructuring occurred in the third quarter of and resulted in total charges of  those charges related to severance and fringe benefit costs of terminating approximately employees  as well as charges related to excess equipment and leased offices 
the restructuring charges are shown as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december    of such costs remained to be paid 
the remaining accrued restructuring costs are expected to be paid in  with the exception of  related to lease payments extending to in  the company recorded restructuring charges of  related primarily to severance and fringe benefit costs associated with the termination of approximately employees  throughout all departments 
no additional workforce reductions or other cost reduction actions are currently planned  however the company will continue to monitor industry conditions and will take corrective action as industry conditions change 
as a result of the above factors  the company recorded a loss from operations of  in compared to income from operations of  in loss from operations represented of sales in  compared to income of of sales in total other income  net decreased to  in versus  in the overall decrease resulted from lower interest income due to lower cash and investment balances in than in  as well as lower average yields on those balances 
loss before income taxes in was  or of sales  compared to income before income taxes of  or in the company s effective income tax benefit rate was in compared to an effective tax expense rate of in the increase in the effective income tax benefit rate in was due primarily to increased benefits associated with research and experimentation credits  the company s foreign sales corporation and state net operating losses 
net loss was  or diluted loss per share  in versus net income of  or diluted earnings per share  in the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding was  for compared to  for the decrease in the weighted average number of shares outstanding was primarily due to the company s stock repurchase program 
during the twelve month program  which ended in september  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock 
total assets decreased from  at december  to  at december   a decrease of  total cash and investments decreased  due primarily to funding of operations  which consumed cash of  stock repurchases of  and purchases of machinery and equipment of  net accounts receivable decreased  as a result of overall lower sales volume and increased collection efforts 
net inventory decreased  relating primarily to inventory charges of over  which the company recorded in  the company s efforts to reduce its working capital investment  as well as overall lower sales volume 
net property plant and equipment decreased  as a result of current year purchases offset by depreciation expense and asset disposals 
partially offsetting those decreases was the increase in income taxes receivable of  due to tax refunds resulting from the current year operating losses 
total liabilities decreased from  at december  to  at december  the largest portion of that total decrease of  was attributable to deferred revenue 
deferred revenue decreased  as a result of the timing of several large customer maintenance and support agreements entered into in late such agreements are initially recorded as deferred revenue and the corresponding revenue is then recognized over the terms of the related agreements 
accrued expenses decreased  from the prior year due primarily to timing considerations and overall lower business volume  partially offset by increased restructuring accruals 
total stockholders equity decreased  primarily as a result of the current year net loss of  and the company s repurchase of common stock in totaling  comparison of to sales for the year ended december  were  a decrease from the prior year s sales of  excluding integration sales of  in and  in  which were almost entirely from one clec customer and were identified as non recurring in nature  annual sales would have been  and  in and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the non recurring revenue in both years  annual sales in decreased  or  from the prior year 
the decrease in non integration sales was due to reduced spending by clec customers throughout the year and reduced spending by larger service providers  including all of our rboc customers  in the second half of the year 
gross profit as a percentage of total sales was for the year ended december  as compared to in the prior year 
the overall increase in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to a change in the overall sales mix as integration sales  which carry a lower gross margin than products and services sales  represented of total sales versus in the following table summarizes sales and gross profit for products  integration and services products integration services total year ended december  sales     gross profit     gross profit year ended december  sales     gross profit     gross profit product sales of  were of total sales in  versus product sales of  or  of total sales in this represented a decrease in product sales in from  due largely to the industry wide reduction in capital spending  particularly in the second half of product sales comprised a larger percentage of total sales in as compared to because of the significant decrease in integration sales in product sales include revenues from the sales of aiswitch  aiscout and other products  as well as software licensing revenues 
gross profit on product sales was for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
product sales margins were generally consistent between years 
however  gross profit in was negatively impacted by inventory charges relating to the establishment of inventory reserves for optical and other component inventory 
due to long lead times and high market demand for optical components  the company placed orders in late and early for optical component inventory to support anticipated sales of luxconnect tm and other optical products 
given the continued uncertain market conditions for carriers deployment of new optical network capacity  as well as declining market prices for optical and other components  the company recorded inventory charges of  during to cover potential excess inventory and market price changes 
these amounts were charged to cost of goods sold 
integration sales of  were of total sales in  compared to  or of total sales in the integration sales in and  consisting of turnkey integrated systems and including a significant amount of third party products integrated with the company s products  were attributable to the sale of an integrated solution to one large customer 
since the first quarter of  the company has had no additional integration sales 
gross profit on integration sales was for the year ended december   compared to in the prior year 
since the integration sales included a significant amount of third party equipment  the gross profit margin was significantly lower than margins on products or services sales 
gross profit in was higher than the prior year because integration sales included a higher proportion of ai equipment and labor  which yields higher gross margins than third party equipment 
services sales of  were of total sales  versus services sales of  or of total sales 
this represented a increase in services sales from the increase in services sales was primarily attributed to the continued expansion of the company s installation services compared to the prior year for a number of customers  as well as project management services for one customer 
services sales include revenues from network planning and design  installation  project management  engineering services  training and maintenance 
gross profit on services sales was for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit on service sales in was primarily attributable to a lower mix of maintenance revenues  which generally have higher margins than revenues from other services  as well as decreased utilization of services personnel in the latter half of as overall spending in the telecommunications industry slowed 
because of the company s concentration of sales to rbocs  long distance phone companies and large clecs  a small number of customers have historically comprised a substantial portion of the company s sales 
sales to four customers comprised of sales in  with each contributing between and of sales 
in  sales to two customers comprised of sales 
sg a expenses increased to  in from  in as a percentage of total sales  this represented in and in the increase in sg a spending was primarily attributable to increased staffing  additional personnel and costs associated with acquisition of certain assets of the remote network management systems and information collection device business of badger technology  inc badger  increased international travel and selling expenses and higher insurance costs 
in addition  sg a expenses as a percentage of total sales increased due to the decrease in integration sales in the current year as compared to the prior year 
r d expenses were  in and  in as a percentage of total sales  this represented for and for the increase in r d expenses was primarily attributable to increased staffing costs to support product development associated with international and wireless opportunities 
the decrease in integration sales in as compared to also contributed to the increase in r d expenses as a percentage of total sales 
the company recorded a non recurring charge to operating expenses of  in the second quarter of to account for an approximate reduction in workforce  or approximately employees  throughout all departments 
this restructuring charge is separately stated on the consolidated statements of operations and reflects estimated severance and fringe benefit costs associated with the termination of employees 
the company paid out all such costs as of december  as a result of the above factors  income from operations decreased to  in from  in income from operations represented of sales in  compared to of sales in income before income taxes in was  or of sales  compared to  or in the company s effective income tax rate was in compared to in the decrease in the effective income tax rate in was due primarily to research and experimentation credits 
the credits had a more significant impact on the effective income tax rate in because of decreased income before income taxes in as compared to net income was  or diluted earnings per share  in versus net income of  or diluted earnings per share  in the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding was  for compared to  for liquidity and capital resources the company had  of cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments at december   a decrease of  from the december  balance of  despite the net loss of  in  operating activities used only  of cash due to certain non cash operating expenses and favorable changes in working capital 
operating expenses not requiring the use of cash included inventory charges of  depreciation and amortization of  and loss on disposal of assets primarily related to the restructuring of  significant changes in working capital which provided cash included decreased accounts receivable of  and decreased inventory of  net of non cash charges  offset by increased income taxes receivable of  decreased deferred revenue of  and decreased accrued expenses of  investing activities in used  in cash  including  for equipment purchases to support operations and  for investment securities purchases net of maturities and sales 
additionally  financing activities used  of cash in  largely attributable to the company repurchasing  of its common stock 
net working capital was  at december  compared to  at december  at december   the current ratio was and the company s only debt outstanding was a  note payable issued in conjunction with the badger asset acquisition in the note payable bears interest at an annual rate of  with interest payments due semi annually and principal due at maturity in august at the april  annual meeting of stockholders  the applied innovation inc employee stock purchase plan the espp was approved and adopted 
the espp authorizes the company to issue up to  shares of common stock to eligible employees  as defined 
the espp has semi annual offering periods commencing january and july during each offering period  eligible employees may purchase shares at a price equal to of fair market value on the first or last business day of the offering period  whichever is lower 
as of december   no shares of common stock were issued pursuant to the espp 
on january   the company issued  shares of stock at a price of per share based on employee payroll deductions for the six month period ending december on august   the company entered into an agreement with the huntington national bank the bank for a credit facility 
the term of the credit facility is days and provides for a line of credit up to  with interest payable monthly and principal due at maturity 
borrowings on the line are subject to a borrowing base limited to  on real estate  plus of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory  as defined in the agreement 
borrowings bear interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus  or the bank s prime commercial rate less  at the option of the company 
borrowings are collateralized by the company s receivables  inventory  certain investments  equipment  real estate and general intangibles 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including  but not limited to  restrictions on the payment of dividends  minimum tangible net worth and a minimum liquidity ratio 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under this facility and was in compliance with all covenants 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents  investments  cash to be generated from future operations and available credit facility will provide sufficient capital to meet the business needs of the company through the end of in addition  the company believes it could generate additional funding through issuance of debt or equity or through the sale of land if the company s working capital needs significantly increase due to circumstances such as sustained weakness in the telecommunications industry resulting in decreased demand for the company s products and services and operating losses  faster than expected growth resulting in increased accounts receivable and inventory  additional investment or acquisition activity  or significant research and development efforts 
however  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to the company or at all 
application of critical accounting policies the company applies certain accounting policies  which are critical in understanding the company s results of operations and the information presented in the consolidated financial statements 
because these policies require judgment and involve choices among alternatives  reported results could vary materially if different assumptions or policies were utilized 
critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized on product and integration sales as products are delivered and ownership and risk of loss are transferred 
in certain limited situations  customers may request that products are built and prepared for shipment but held temporarily by the company on the customer s behalf 
in those instances  revenue is recognized when all other terms and obligations of the sale are met  including transfer of ownership and risk of loss 
the company also derives revenue from the sale of network management system projects that may include a combination of the following multiple elements internally developed software  resale of third party software and related computer equipment  installation  training and consulting services  and company provided and third party maintenance and support agreements for the software and equipment 
in a multiple element arrangement  revenue from the individual elements is unbundled based on their relative fair values and recognized as follows software license fee revenue on internally developed software is recognized in accordance with the following four elements of software revenue recognition persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the related fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
software license fees are generally recognized when the software product has been delivered  which is generally the point at which all four criteria have been met 
third party software and equipment revenue are recognized when delivery has occurred and ownership and risk of loss have transferred 
revenue from resale of third party maintenance contracts is recorded upon delivery of the maintenance agreement 
revenue from installation  training and consulting services is recognized as the services are delivered or upon project completion 
revenue from maintenance and support agreements is recognized straight line over the term of the related agreement 
the company also generates revenue from the activities of its services division 
installation service projects are typically short term projects that are billed and accepted by the customer on a project by project basis  with revenue recognized upon project completion 
revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized straight line over the related maintenance period 
sales return allowances other than issues involving warranty claims  customers generally do not have the right to return products 
however  in certain limited circumstances as defined in contracts  customers are permitted to return products 
the company establishes a sales return allowance  when necessary  reflecting its estimate of such product returns 
the estimate is based on a number of factors  including the contract provisions  the company s understanding of each customer s forecasted usage of previously purchased products and the estimated likelihood that customers will return products 
at december  and  the company has no sales return allowances recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company sells to its customers on credit  generally requiring payment within thirty days from delivery 
since the company s customer base is generally comprised of very large  well funded service providers  the company s historical credit risk has been very low 
however  the company does establish allowances against accounts receivable for potentially uncollectible amounts 
the company estimates necessary allowances based on its analysis of customers outstanding receivables at the individual invoice level  the customers payment history and any other known factors concerning their current financial condition and ability to pay 
after the company has exhausted its collection efforts and determined that amounts are uncollectible at the individual invoice level  such amounts are charged off against the allowance 
to the extent any customers unexpectedly become insolvent or unable to pay amounts due  the allowance estimates may be incorrect 
over the last twelve to twenty four months  many telecommunications service providers  including some that have historically been customers of the company  have experienced financial challenges 
the company did not have any significant exposure to bankruptcies among our customers 
further  the company has not historically provided vendor financing to its customers  and currently has no plans to do so 
inventory the company records inventory utilizing standard costs  which approximate actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
additionally  the company carries inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the company periodically estimates its necessary reserve for inventory obsolescence to ensure inventory balances are properly stated 
such estimates are based on inventory quantities on hand  sales forecasts for particular products  overall industry trends that may affect individual product lines  as well as fluctuations in component prices from suppliers 
continued weak demand and falling component prices could impact the valuation of the company s inventory 
intangible assets and goodwill the company has certain intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions that are recorded at cost 
these intangible assets are amortized straight line over their respective estimated economic lives  generally up to three years  and are reviewed for impairment under certain circumstances 
goodwill  representing the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired  is not subject to periodic amortization 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change 
warranty the company generally warrants its products for a minimum of one year after sale 
based primarily on historical experience and any known warranty issues with existing products  the company estimates its expected future warranty costs and accrues such costs at the time of sale 
warranty costs generally consist of labor and materials to repair defective parts  replacement parts  shipping costs to replace materials  and labor and travel costs associated with customer site visits to repair products or correct prior service work 
the company s overall warranty costs have been decreasing over the past several years  primarily due to improved product quality 
however  as the company introduces new products using new technology or if defects are found in widely distributed products  such costs could increase in the future 
income taxes the company utilizes the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and respective tax bases 
the company s provision for income taxes involves estimates of taxable income for federal  state and local purposes in various taxing jurisdictions as well as estimated research and experimentation credits and estimated credits related to foreign sales  all of which could be subject to change in the event of an audit by the internal revenue service 
stock based compensation under various stock option plans  the company has issued stock options to employees and members of the company s board of directors 
the company applies the intrinsic value based method of accounting for its fixed plan stock options and therefore must record compensation expense for any options granted with an exercise price less than the current market price at the date of grant 
because the company has not granted any options with exercise prices less than market prices at the date of grant  the company has not recorded any compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations 
had the company accounted for its stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  a fair value based method  rather than an intrinsic value based method  the company would have recognized additional compensation expense  net of related tax effects  of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
use of estimates in addition to the above critical accounting policies  the company utilizes certain estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
because these estimates are inherently subjective and affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as contingent assets and liabilities  different estimates would yield different results as reported in the consolidated financial statements 
areas that involve utilization of significant estimates include accounting for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence  estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  depreciation and amortization  sales returns  warranty costs  income taxes and contingencies 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company is obligated over the next four years for office space under various operating leases 
future minimum lease payments  net of estimated sublease payments under these leases  are  in   in   in and  in the company s note payable of  is due in august also  related to the badger acquisition  the company may make contingent payments of up to  based on certain product sales over the next two years 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
statement requires the company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or normal use of the assets 
the company also records a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
the company adopted statement on january  statement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities by requiring that expenses related to the exit of an activity or disposal of long lived assets will be recorded when they are incurred and measurable 
prior to statement  these charges were accrued at the time of commitment to exit or dispose of an activity 
the company adopted statement no 
on january   and it is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not have any material exposure to interest rate changes  commodity price changes  foreign currency fluctuations  or similar market risks 
the company invests in various debt obligations  primarily us government and agency obligations and high quality commercial paper  with maturities generally less than three years 
although the yields on such investments are subject to changes in interest rates  the potential impact to the company and its future earnings as a result of customary interest rate fluctuations is immaterial 
furthermore  the company has not entered into any derivative contracts 
related to the badger acquisition  the company has a  note payable  bearing interest at a fixed rate of annually and due in august
