cymer s revenues consist of product sales  which include sales of light source systems  consumable and spare parts  upgrades  service  service contracts  and training 
other revenues include revenue from funded development activities performed for customers and government contracts and license agreements 
revenue from light source system sales is generally recognized at the time of shipment  unless customer agreements contain inspection  acceptance or other conditions  in which case revenue is recognized at the time such conditions are satisfied 
revenue from consumables and spare parts sales is recognized at the point that legal title passes to the customer  which is generally upon shipment from the cymer facility 
service and training revenue is generally recognized at the time that the services are rendered or the training class is completed 
service contracts revenues are generally recorded to revenue ratably over the life of the contract or per the specific terms of the agreement 
funded development contracts are accounted for on the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
if milestones on funded development contracts require that specific results be achieved or reported by cymer  revenue is not recognized until that milestone is completed 
product sales increased from million in to million in  primarily due to a increase in the asp of cymer s light source systems and an increase in consumable and spare parts  service revenue and other non system products 
a total of light source systems were sold in at an asp of  compared to systems sold in at an asp of  on a foreign currency adjusted basis  the asp for was  compared to  for this increase in foreign currency adjusted asp from period to period reflects increased sales in of cymer s nanolith and els series products which have higher asps compared to the els krf series products sold in sales of consumable and spare parts and service products increased from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in this type of product sales was due to slightly increased utilization of cymer s deep ultraviolet duv light sources by chipmakers and an increased installed base in the year ended december  revenues from funded development projects were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cymer s backlog at december  was million as compared to million at december  bookings for the year ended december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to bookings of cymer s higher priced els and xla product in cymer installed light sources at chipmakers and other end users during as compared to light sources installed during cymer s sales are generated primarily by shipments to customers in japan  the netherlands  and the united states 
approximately and of cymer s sales in and  respectively  were derived from customers outside the united states 
cymer maintains a wholly owned japanese subsidiary which sells to cymer s japanese customers 
revenues from japanese customers  generated primarily by this subsidiary  accounted for and of revenues in and  respectively 
the activities of cymer s japanese subsidiary are limited to sales and service of products purchased by the subsidiary from the parent corporation 
cymer anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its net sales 
sales to cymer s three largest customers  asm lithography  canon  and nikon  amounted to  and  respectively  of total revenue for the year ended december   and  and  respectively  of total revenue for the year ended december  cost of product sales 
cost of product sales includes direct material and labor  warranty expenses  license fees  and manufacturing and service overhead  and foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts associated with purchases of cymer s products by its japanese subsidiary for resale under firm third party sales commitments 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  for those derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting  deferral of the gains or losses is not allowed and the gains and losses are recorded in other income expense 
cymer adopted sfas on january   but did not qualify for hedge accounting until july  accordingly  for contracts entered into prior to july   cymer recorded changes in the fair value of its foreign currency forward exchange contracts directly through earnings in other income expense 
for contracts entered into on or after july   cymer defers effective changes in the fair value of its foreign currency forward exchange contracts into other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassifies the effective changes to cost of product sales in the same period that the related sale is made to the third party 
for the year ended december   only those foreign currency forward exchange contracts meeting the transition period requirements under sfas and contracts entered into after july  were included in cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of income 
for the year ended december   cymer qualified for hedge accounting treatment under sfas and was able to record the net effect of gains or losses from foreign currency forward exchange contracts in cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of income as the related sale to the third party was recognized 
cymer recognized a gain in cost of sales on such contracts of million and a net loss of  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
although the number of light source systems recognized to revenue was lower in as compared to  the cost of product sales increased from million in to million in this increase from period to period is primarily due to the higher material cost of the els and nanolith light source systems and the higher warranty provisions required for the early shipments of these newer model light sources in in addition  net losses in as compared to net gains in on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts entered into by cymer s japan subsidiary contributed to this overall cost of sales increase 
these cost of product increases during were partially offset by increased manufacturing efficiencies in the gross margin on product sales was and for and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin in as compared to is primarily due to the building of inventories in in preparation for the initial manufacturing of the xla product 
with the xla production starting in the fourth quarter of  production activities were higher than normal in the earlier quarters of to accommodate the ramp of this new product 
although there were fewer light source system unit sales during as compared to  production levels were much higher  resulting in increased manufacturing efficiencies and higher ending inventory balances in a portion of the dollar increase in inventory is due to the initial material build requirements and higher overall cost of the xla product 
for the twelve months ended december   cymer s inventory balances decreased by million from december   whereas inventory balances increased by million during the twelve months ended december  research and development 
research and development expenses include costs of internally funded and externally funded projects as well as continuing research support expenses which primarily include employee and material costs  depreciation of equipment and other engineering related costs 
research and development expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due primarily to cymer s most recent product development effort  the mopa platform  or xl series 
cymer shipped the first light source system that utilizes the mopa platform  the xla  in february cymer also continued to invest in euv technology and the continuing engineering of the els and nanolith products 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses increased from to  primarily due to mopa platform development effort 
we do not expect this upward trend to continue and anticipate that r d spending on duv systems will begin to decrease in absolute dollars as the productization of the xla approaches completion 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include the expenses of the sales  marketing and customer support staffs and other marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due primarily to increased operational efficiencies as well as heightened cost controls made necessary by the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses decreased from to 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of management and administrative personnel costs  professional services and administrative operating costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due primarily to ongoing improvements in operational efficiencies and increased cost controls in necessitated by overall industry conditions 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses decreased from to 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease in amortization of goodwill and intangible assets was primarily due to the adoption of sfas on january  which discontinued the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives associate with previous purchase business combinations 
in  cymer amortized amounts associated with the goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of acx now known as cymer boston in february in  cymer only amortized intangible assets with definite lives per sfas purchased in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development expenses consist of costs associated with the acquisition of a company and its in process research and development projects 
cymer incurred million of such expenses during the year ended december  compared to no such expenses for the year ended december  these expenses for the year ended december  were due to the acquisition of acx and represented the fair value of acx development projects associated with the application of its technology to the semiconductor market 
as of the date of the acx acquisition  this purchased in process research and development was expensed because the application of this technology to the semiconductor market was at a stage of development that required further research and development before reaching technological feasibility and commercial viability 
other expense net 
net other income expense consists primarily of interest income and expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses associated with fluctuations in the value of the japanese yen against the united states dollar and gains and losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
net other expense totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net other expense was primarily due to increased interest expense and foreign exchange losses during the year which were almost completely offset by increased interest income 
although the interest rate on the notes is lower than the blended rate on the notes  interest expense was higher in as compared to as a result of additional interest from both the notes and notes being outstanding in early the increased interest income in was primarily due to higher cash balances  which resulted from the bond transactions  which occurred in the first quarter of these transactions included the private placement of the notes in february and the redemption of the notes that were not converted to common stock prior to the march  redemption date 
foreign currency exchange gains totaled  interest income totaled million and interest expense totaled million for the year ended december   compared to foreign currency exchange losses of  interest income of million and interest expense of million for the year ended december  cymer s results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the value of the japanese yen against the united states dollar 
sales by cymer to its japanese subsidiary are denominated in dollars  and sales by the subsidiary to customers in japan are denominated in yen 
cymer s japanese subsidiary manages its exposure to such fluctuations by entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge its cash flow exposure to cymer 
from january  through june   gains or losses resulting from the change in the value of contracts entered into prior to july  were recorded as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income 
subsequent to june   gains or losses resulting from contracts entered into after july  are initially recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
the net amount of unrealized effective gain or loss on the date the light source system is received by cymer s japanese subsidiary is reclassified to cost of sales on the date that the light source system is sold to the third party 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are accumulated as a separate component of consolidated stockholders equity 
income tax provision 
the tax provision of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  reflects an annual effective rate of and  respectively 
the decrease in the annual effective tax rate during the year ended december  from to is primarily attributable to tax benefits from us export incentive programs and research and development and manufacturing investment credits 
the annual effective tax rates for both periods are less than the us statutory rate of primarily as a result of permanent book tax differences and tax credits 
years ended december  and revenues 
product sales decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to decreased sales of light source systems  spares and consumables and service products 
this decrease in sales from period to period was due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry which caused both a lower demand for light source systems and a decreased demand for consumables and spare parts as a result of lower utilization of cymer s installed base of light sources 
a total of light source systems were sold in at an asp of  compared to systems sold in at an asp of  the higher asp in helped to offset the lower quantity of light source systems sold during the year and was the result of cymer s continued introduction of newer model light sources which command higher prices 
revenues from funded development projects increased from million in to million in this increase from period to period was primarily due to additional government contract revenues generated through the acquisition of acx  now known as cymer boston  during the first quarter of during  the majority of revenues generated by cymer boston were from funded development contracts and accounted for million of the total million funded development projects revenue for the year ended december  approximately and of cymer s sales for the years ended december  and  respectively  were derived from customers outside the united states 
revenues from japanese customers  generated primarily by cymer s wholly owned japanese subsidiary  accounted for and of revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales to cymer s three largest customers  asm lithography  canon  and nikon amounted to  and  respectively  of total revenue for the year ended december  and  and  respectively  of total revenue for the year ended december  cost of product sales 
cost of product sales decreased from million in to million in due primarily to the decrease in sales of products from period to period 
the gross margin on these sales decreased from in to in this decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of lower product sales absorbing both higher fixed manufacturing costs and worldwide field support infrastructure costs offset by continued operational efficiencies 
for the year ended december   net gains or losses from foreign currency forward exchange contracts were included in cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of income as the related sales to the third party were recognized 
for the year ended december   only those contracts meeting the transition period requirements under sfas were included in cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of income 
cymer recognized net gains in cost of sales on such contracts of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  due primarily to increased development efforts associated with arf light source development which includes cymer s nanolith light source and development efforts associated with mopa product platform and euv technology 
research and evelopment expenses associated with the nanolith light source increased during the second half of as it moved into the production phase and initial units were shipped to customers during the third quarter of research and development expenses were also higher during due to continued investment in next generation product development to keep pace with technological change in industry requirements as well as the additional research and development expenses associated with cymer boston and its acx technology 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses increased from to due to both decreased revenues and increased spending from period to period 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in due primarily to increased operational efficiencies as well as heightened cost controls as a result of the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry during as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses increased from to due to decreased revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in this was due primarily to ongoing improvements in operational efficiencies and increased cost controls for the period due to industry conditions 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses increased from to due to decreased revenues 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets totaled  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in amortization of goodwill and intangible assets was primarily attributable to the amortization of goodwill of million related to the acquisition of cymer boston in early purchased in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development expenses consist of costs associated with the acquisition of cymer boston and its in process research and development projects in cymer incurred million of such expenses during the year ended december  related to this acquisition  compared to no such expenses for the year ended december  other income expense net 
net other expense totaled million in compared to million in the increase in net other expense from period to period is primarily due to lower cash and investment balances as well as lower yields on those investments 
this was offset by gains associated with the change in value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts for cymer s contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment per sfas in foreign currency exchange losses totaled million  interest income totaled million  interest expense totaled million  compared to an exchange gain of million  interest income of million  interest expense of million in provision for income taxes 
the tax provision of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  reflect an annual effective rate of and  respectively 
the annual effective tax rates for both periods are less than the us statutory rate of primarily as a result of permanent book tax differences and tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cymer had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  million in long term investments  and million in working capital 
in august  cymer issued million in aggregate principal amount in a private placement of notes 
the step up convertible subordinated notes were due on august  and were convertible at the option of the holder into shares of common stock of cymer 
the conversion rate on the notes was shares per  principal amount or an effective conversion price of per share 
the notes were called for redemption on march  immediately prior to the march  redemption date  holders of million of the outstanding principal amount converted their notes into shares of cymer s common stock 
as a result of these conversions   shares of cymer common stock were issued to the note holders and the remaining million of the outstanding principal amount of the notes was redeemed 
in february  cymer issued million in aggregate principal amount in a private placement of notes 
the notes are due on february  with interest payable semi annually on february and august of each year at per annum 
the notes are convertible into shares of cymer common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount or an effective conversion price of per share 
cymer used a portion of the net proceeds from this private placement to redeem the notes 
the remaining proceeds will be used for cymer s future operating  investing and financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a significant increase in net income 
increases in inventory  accounts receivable  and income taxes payable resulted from increased revenues and bookings in and were offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities during the year 
net cash provided by operating activities during primarily reflects a significant reduction in net income due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry during as a result of this downturn and overall reduced business activities during the period  there were significant decreases in accounts receivable and inventory during the period 
these were offset by decreases in accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities  and income taxes payable during the same period 
net cash provided by operating activities during primarily reflects increases in net income  accounts payable and other liabilities offset by increases in inventory 
the increase in inventory was primarily due to the increased bookings and overall business activities in the first three quarters and new raw materials requirements associated with the initial production of the xla in the fourth quarter of net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
in  cash used in investing activities increased significantly from  primarily due to property acquisitions to accommodate the increased business activities in  including the construction of an additional facility at the san diego  california location for a total of million  the purchase and the deployment of a new erp system for a total of million  and a purchase of an additional undeveloped parcel of land adjacent to the san diego  california facility for million 
this parcel of land is the site of cymer s newest facility which is currently under construction 
in addition  million in cash was used in to acquire the minority interest in cymer s taiwan subsidiary 
in  the cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the timing of short term and long term investments maturing and being reinvested during the period offset by a million payment made to acquire patents and the purchase of million in capital equipment 
in  the million used in investing activities primarily reflects short term and long term investments made using the net proceeds generated by the convertible subordinated note transactions in february and march  and million in capital equipment purchases 
included in these capital purchases for are costs associated with cymer s new spare parts refurbishment factory in korea  which was completed in september  and costs associated with the construction of a new manufacturing and office facility adjacent to cymer s corporate headquarters located in san diego  california 
in july  cymer entered into an agreement with a contractor for the construction of a  square foot building adjacent to the corporate headquarters 
this manufacturing and office facility will be completed in two phases  with phase one currently scheduled for completion by april and phase two  as required throughout cymer will self fund the cost of the construction project  which is estimated to be approximately million 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for compared to net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million and million for and  respectively 
in  the million net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to million in employee stock option exercises offset by a million net payment made during the year on cymer s revolving loan 
in  the cash used in financing activities was attributable to the repurchase of million in outstanding notes and a net payment on the revolving loan of million during the period  partially offset by the receipt of million from the exercise of employee stock options 
in  the million provided by financing activities was primarily due to the activity during the first quarter of related to cymer s convertible subordinated notes 
the private placement of notes that cymer completed in february resulted in net proceeds to cymer of approximately million 
of these proceeds  cymer used million to redeem a portion of its outstanding notes and pay accrued interest and premiums on those notes 
in addition  during cymer received proceeds of million from the exercise of employee stock options 
during and  cymer maintained certain loan agreements with a commercial bank the loan agreements which provided for unsecured revolving loan facilities allowing for borrowings of million and million under a us line of credit and japanese line of credit  respectively 
under the loan agreements  cymer may borrow in us dollars or japanese yen  and interest accrues on outstanding borrowings at libor plus on us dollar denominated borrowings and at the yen cost of funds rate plus on yen denominated borrowings 
the loan agreements require cymer to maintain compliance with certain financial and other covenants  including tangible net worth  quick ratio and profitability requirements 
as of december   cymer was in compliance with all such covenants 
the loan agreements expire on june  as of december  and  respectively  there was million and million outstanding at annual interest rates of and  respectively  under the loan agreements 
since its initial public offering and a secondary public offering  both in  cymer has funded its operations primarily from cash generated from operations  the proceeds of convertible subordinated note offerings in august and february  bank borrowings  and the proceeds from employee stock option exercises 
cymer requires substantial working capital to fund its business  particularly to finance inventories and accounts receivable and for capital expenditures 
cymer s future capital requirements depend on many factors  including cymer s manufacturing activity  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  expansion of sales and marketing and field service and support  competitive labor market compensation requirements  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and the market acceptance of cymer s products 
cymer believes that it has sufficient working capital and available banking arrangements to sustain operations and provide for the future expansion of its business for at least the next months 
the following summarizes cymer s contractual obligations and other commitments as of december   and the impact such obligations could have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands amount of commitment expiring by period thereafter capital leases payable operating leases payable convertible subordinated notes total commitments critical accounting policies and estimates cymer s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon cymer s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires cymer to make estimates and use judgment that may impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
as a part of its on going internal processes  cymer evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventory allowances  warranty provisions  revenue recognition  allowances for bad debt  long lived assets valuation  intangible assets valuation  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
cymer bases these estimates upon both historical information and other assumptions that it believes valid and reasonable under the circumstances 
these assumptions form the basis for making judgments and determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
cymer believes that inventory allowances and warranty provisions require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements than other accounting estimates 
cymer maintains an inventory allowance to record inventory at net realizable value 
the value of this allowance is determined by taking into consideration certain assumptions related to market conditions and future demands for its products which may result in excess or obsolete inventory 
if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than projected by management  adjustments to this inventory allowance may be required 
cymer provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the warranty coverage period and terms vary by light source model 
in general  the light source system warranty period ranges from to months after shipment 
cymer also warrants spare parts sold to its customers and the coverage period varies by spare part type as some types include time based warranty periods and others include usage based warranty periods 
on average  the warranty period for spare parts is approximately months from the date of shipment 
cymer records a provision for warranty for all products which is included in cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of income and is recorded at the time that the related revenue is recognized 
the warranty provision for light source systems is determined by using a financial model which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with cymer s different light source system models 
this financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision 
the risk levels used within this model are reviewed and updated as risk levels change by model over its product life cycle 
the warranty provision for spares is determined by using actual historical data 
although cymer engages in product improvement programs and processes  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures at customer sites 
should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from cymer s estimates  revisions to its estimated warranty provision would be required 
factors that may affect financial condition and future results cymer participates in an industry that is very cyclical in nature and subject to rapid technological changes and demands by its customers 
the following are important risk factors that could affect actual results and cause them to differ materially from the projected results in the forward looking statements in this report cymer s business depends on the semiconductor equipment industry  which is volatile and unpredictable  cymer depends on the introduction of new products for its success  and is subject to risks associated with rapid technological change  a significant percentage of cymer s revenue is derived from sales to a few large customers  and if cymer is not able to retain these customers  or they reschedule  reduce or cancel orders  cymer s revenues would be reduced and its financial results would suffer  a substantial percentage of cymer s revenue is derived from the sale of a limited number of primary products  economic  political  regulatory and other events in geographic areas where cymer has significant sales or operations could interfere with cymer s business  cymer depends on a few key suppliers for purchasing components and subassemblies that are included in its products  cymer faces competition from two other companies and may face competition from additional competitors who enter the market  cymer depends on key personnel  especially management and technical personnel  who may be difficult to attract and retain  failure to maintain effectively cymer s direct field service and support organization could have a material adverse effect on its business  cymer s ability to compete could be jeopardized if it is unable to protect its intellectual property rights 
these types of claims could seriously harm cymer s business or require cymer to incur significant costs  the parties to whom cymer provides research and development services may dispute the ownership of the intellectual property that cymer develops performing these services  in the future  cymer may be subject to patent litigation to enforce patents issued to cymer and have to defend itself against claimed infringement by cymer s competitors or any third party  trademark infringement claims against cymer s registered and unregistered trademarks would be expensive and cymer may have to stop using such trademarks and pay damages  cymer is exposed to risks related to the fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for the japanese yen  semiconductor device manufacturers prolonged use of cymer s product in high volume productions may not produce the results they desire  and as a result  cymer s reputation could be damaged in the semiconductor industry as well as with cymer s customers who supply photolithography tools to the semiconductor manufacturers  cymer has in the past and may in the future acquire businesses that will involve numerous risks 
cymer may not be able to address these risks successfully without substantial expense  delay or other operational and financial problems  cymer must develop and manufacture enhancements to its existing products and introduce new products in order to grow its business 
cymer may not effectively manage its growth and integrate these new enhancements and products  which could materially harm its business  cymer is dependent on its manufacturing facilities and subcontractors to assemble and test its product  cymer s products are subject to potential product liability claims if personal injury or death result  and the price of cymer s common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely 
at december  and  cymer did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  cymer did not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  cymer is not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships 
cymer does not have relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with cymer or its related parties except as disclosed herein

our revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter have varied in the past and our future operating results may continue to fluctuate significantly due to many factors including those listed in this section and throughout this annual report on form k for the period ending december  these factors include demand for semiconductors in general and  in particular  for leading edge devices with smaller circuit geometries  cyclicality in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  rates at which semiconductor device manufacturers take delivery of photolithography tools from our customers  rates at which our customers take delivery of light source systems from us  timing and size of orders from our small base of customers  mix of light source models  consumable and spare parts and service revenues in our total revenues  changes in the price and profitability of our products  our ability to develop and implement new technologies and introduce new products  utilization rates of light sources and sales of consumable and spare parts and services  our ability to manage our manufacturing requirements  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  principally with respect to the japanese yen in which sales by our japanese subsidiary are denominated  worldwide political instability  changing global economic conditions  and intellectual property protection 
we also have historically derived a large portion of our quarterly and annual revenues from selling a small number of light source systems 
because we sell a small number of products  the precise time that we recognize revenue from an order may have a significant impact on our total revenue for a particular period 
our customers may cancel or reschedule orders with little or no penalty 
orders expected in one quarter could shift to another period due to changes in the anticipated timing of customers purchase decisions or rescheduled delivery dates requested by our customers 
our operating results for a particular quarter or year may be adversely affected if our customers  particulary our three largest customers  cancel or reschedule orders  or if we cannot fill orders in time due to unexpected delays in manufacturing  testing  shipping  and product acceptance 
we manage our expense levels based  in large part  on expected future revenues 
as a result  our expenses are relatively fixed for the short term  and if our actual revenue decreases below the level we expect  our operating results will be adversely affected 
as a result of these or other factors  we could fail to achieve our expectations as to future revenue  gross profit and operating income 
our failure to meet the performance expectations set and published by external sources could result in a sudden and significant drop in the price of our stock  particularly on a short term basis  and could negatively affect the value of any investment in our stock 
our business depends on the semiconductor equipment industry  which is highly volatile and unpredictable 
the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical 
we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from photolithography tool manufacturers our customers 
our customers depend in turn on the demand for their photolithography tool products from their customers  the semiconductor device manufacturers 
the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically has experienced periodic ups and downs and is currently in a significant and prolonged downturn 
this cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and  thus future expense levels 
when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels  operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound 
during a down cycle  we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees 
in addition  during periods of rapid growth  we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand 
we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles 
the current downturn has had a severe effect on the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  including photolithography tools that our customers produce 
we are not able to predict when the semiconductor industry will recover 
if overall market conditions continue to deteriorate in the near term  our current operating levels may negatively impact our profitability 
we believe that downturns in the semiconductor manufacturing industry will periodically occur  and result in periodic decreases in demand for all semiconductor manufacturing equipment  including photolithography tools our customers manufacture 
as a result  fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor device manufacturers and pricing volatility will continue to materially affect our aggregate bookings  revenues and operating results 
also  even during periods of reduced revenues we believe we must continue to invest in research and development and to maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive  which may temporarily harm our financial results 
accordingly  these downturns are likely to continue to adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results and our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters 
such failure to meet operating result expectations would materially adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our customers try to manage their inventories and production requirements to appropriate levels that best reflect their expected sales to semiconductor device manufacturers 
market conditions in the industry and production efficiency of the photolithography tool manufacturers can cause our customers to expand or reduce their orders for new light source systems as they try to manage their inventories and production requirements to these levels 
we continue to work with our customers to better understand these issues 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in understanding our customers inventory management and production requirements or that our customers will not build up an excess inventory of light source products 
if our customers retain an excess inventory of light source products  our revenue could be reduced in future periods as the excess inventory is utilized  which would adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we depend on the introduction of new products for our success  and we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 
rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes 
we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop  manufacture and timely introduce new light source products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing light source systems and process capabilities 
due to the risks inherent in transitioning to new products  we must forecast accurate demand for new products while managing the transition from older products 
our newest product introduction project consists of a technology change from a single discharge chamber designed excimer light source to a dual discharge chamber design called mopa 
this mopa design represents a paradigm shift from current lithography technology and is projected to enable higher power  tighter bandwidth and lower cost of operation for future optical lithography applications across all three duv wavelengths nm  nm and nm 
there are risks inherent in transitioning to this new technology 
these risks include effective execution of the product development plan  adoption of the product by photolithography tool manufacturers and semiconductor manufacturers  manufacturability and cost effectiveness of the new products and the development of a comparable product by our competitors 
we believe that semiconductor device manufacturers are currently developing a capability to produce devices that are measured at micron or less  and these efforts are driving the current demand for our light source products for duv photolithography systems 
after semiconductor device manufacturers have this capability  their demand for our light source products will depend on whether they want to expand their capacity to manufacture these devices 
this will in turn depend on whether their sales forecasts and projected manufacturing process yields justify the necessary investments 
future technologies  such as euv and epl  may render our excimer light source products obsolete 
we must manage product transitions  as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products 
if new products are not introduced on time  or have reliability or quality problems  our performance may be impacted by reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in acceptance of and payment for new products  and additional service and warranty expenses 
we may not be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a timely or cost effective manner that satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance 
failure to develop and introduce these new products and enhancements could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors 
we believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products to this market  which may affect our ability to sell our new products 
furthermore  new products represent significant investments of our resources and their success  or lack thereof  could have a material effect on our financial results 
a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from sales to a few large customers  and if we are not able to retain these customers  or they reschedule  reduce or cancel orders  delay or default on payments  our revenues would be reduced and our financial condition and cash flows would suffer 
three large companies  asm lithography  canon and nikon dominate the photolithography tool business 
collectively  these three companies accounted for the following percentage of our total revenue during the periods indicated years ended december  asm lithography canon nikon total collectively  these three companies account for the following percentage of our total accounts receivable for the periods indicated december  asm lithography canon nikon total we expect that sales of our light source products to these three customers will continue to account for a substantial majority of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
none of our customers are obligated to purchase a minimum number of our products in the aggregate or during any particular period 
the loss of any significant business from or production problems for any one of these three customers will have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
sales to these customers may be affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include a change in a customer s competitive position in its industry  a customer experiencing duv photolithography tool production problems  a decision to purchase light sources from other suppliers  changes in economic conditions in the semiconductor or the photolithography tool industries  and a decline in a customer s financial condition 
a substantial percentage of our revenue is derived from the sale of a limited number of primary products 
our only product line is excimer light source systems  which include krypton fluoride  argon fluoride and fluorine systems  and we expect these primary products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term 
continued market acceptance of our primary products is  therefore  critical to our future success 
the primary market for excimer light sources is in the use of duv photolithography equipment for manufacturing deep submicron semiconductor devices using smaller circuit geometries 
the demand for our products depends in part on the rate at which semiconductor device manufacturers further adopt excimer light sources as the chosen light source for their photolithography tools 
semiconductor manufacturers may choose not to adopt excimer light sources for a variety of reasons  including instability of photoresists used in advanced duv photolithography  and potential shortages of specialized materials used in duv optics 
we cannot guarantee that these factors can or will be overcome or that the demand for our excimer light source products will not be materially reduced 
the demand for our light source products  and therefore our operating results  financial condition and cash flows  could be adversely affected by a number of factors  including a decline in demand for our customers duv photolithography tools  a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our products  an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in  technological change that we are unable to address with our products  and a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis 
economic  political  regulatory and other events in geographic areas where we have significant sales or operations could interfere with our business 
we serve an increasingly global market 
a large portion of our total revenues is derived from customers located outside of the united states  particularly in asian countries 
we expect our international sales to continue to account for a very large portion of our total revenues 
in order to support our foreign customers  we must maintain subsidiaries located in japan  korea  taiwan  singapore  the people s republic of china and the netherlands  as well as further develop our field service  support  and manufacturing operations 
we may not be able to manage our operations to address and support our global customers effectively 
further  our investments in these types of activities may not make us competitive in the global market or we may not be able to meet the service  support  and manufacturing levels required by our global customers 
additionally  we are subject to the risks inherent in doing business globally  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuations in exchange rates and currency controls  political and economic conditions and instability  imposition of trade barriers and restrictions  including changes in tariff and freight rates  foreign customs and duties  difficulty in coordinating our management and operations in several different countries  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations  limited intellectual property protection in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences in some countries  the possibility of accounts receivable collection difficulties  in the case of asia  the risk of business interruption and damage from earthquakes  the effect of acts of terrorism and war  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
many of our major customers and many of the semiconductor device manufacturers who use our light source products in their photolithography systems are located in asia 
economic problems and currency fluctuations affecting these regions in asia could create a larger risk for us 
further  even though it has not been difficult for us to comply with united states export controls  these export rules could change in the future and make it more difficult or impossible for us to export our products to many countries 
any of these vulnerabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must effectively manage changes in our business 
in order to respond to the business cycles of the semiconductor industry  in the past few years we have sharply expanded and contracted the scope of our operations and the number of employees in many of our departments 
as the semiconductor industry grows and contracts we will need to closely manage our global operations  improve our process and other internal management systems  improve our quality control  order fulfillment  field service and customer support capabilities  quickly adapt to changing sales and marketing channels  effectively manage our inventory levels  and attract  train  retain and manage key personnel 
if we fail to effectively manage changes in our business  our operating results  financial condition and cash flows would be adversely affected 
we depend on a few key suppliers for purchasing components and subassemblies that are included in our products 
we purchase some of the components and subassemblies included in our light source products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
for certain optical components used in its light source systems  we currently utilize a single supplier 
although we have not aggressively pursued other vendors for these optical components  we have attempted to qualify one other vendor 
to date  this vendor has been unsuccessful in producing these optical components and has not been qualified by us 
to reduce the risk associated with this single supplier  we carry a two year supply of these optical components 
this two year supply is based upon current business activities  so any significant increase in production would likely result in a quicker consumption of these optical components 
in addition  we outsource the manufacture of various subassemblies more often than in the past 
further  some of our suppliers have specialized in supplying equipment or manufacturing services to semiconductor equipment manufacturers and therefore have been adversely affected by the current industry downturn 
if the current downturn continues for an extended period of time  these suppliers may not be able to continue to meet our requirements or respond quickly enough 
due to the nature of our product development requirements  these key suppliers must rapidly advance their own technologies and production capabilities in order to support the introduction schedule of our new products 
these suppliers may not be able to provide new modules and subassemblies when they are needed to satisfy our product schedule requirements 
if we cannot purchase enough of these materials  components or subassemblies  or if these items do not meet our quality standards  there could be delays or reductions in our product shipments  which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we face competition from two companies and may face competition from additional competitors who enter the market 
we are currently aware of two significant competitors that sell light sources for duv photolithography applications 
these competitors are gigaphoton  a joint venture between two large companies  komatsu and ushio  which is headquartered in japan  and lambda physik  a company headquartered in germany  majority owned by coherent  inc  a us company 
we believe that gigaphoton and lambda physik are aggressively trying to gain larger market penetration in the excimer light source industry 
we believe that our customers have purchased products from these two competitors and that our customers have approved these competitors light sources for use with their products 
we believe that gigaphoton  in particular  has been approved by chipmakers in japan and elsewhere for producing excimer light sources 
also  we believe that lambda physik has been approved by chipmakers in the us and europe for producing excimer light source products 
the market for excimer light sources is still small and immature 
larger competitors with substantially greater resources  such as other manufacturers of industrial light sources for advanced lithography  may attempt to sell competitive products to our customers 
potential competitors may also be attracted to our growing installed base of light sources and may attempt to supply consumable products and refurbished parts to that installed base 
if any existing or future competitors gain market acceptance we could lose market share and our growth could slow or decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we depend on key personnel  especially management and technical personnel  who may be difficult to attract and retain 
we are highly dependent on the services of many key employees in various areas  including engineering  research and development  sales and marketing  field service  manufacturing  and management 
in particular  there are a limited number of experts in excimer light source technology  and we require highly skilled hardware and software engineers 
competition for qualified personnel is intense and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel as needed 
we do not have employment agreements with most of our employees 
we believe that our future growth and operating results will depend on the continued services of our engineering  research and development  sales and marketing  manufacturing and field service  and management personnel  our ability to attract  train and retain highly skilled key personnel  and the ability of our personnel and key employees to continue to expand  train and manage our employee base 
if we are unable to hire  train and retain key personnel as required  our operating results  financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 
failure to maintain effectively our direct field service and support organization could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe it is critical for us to provide quick and responsive service directly to the semiconductor device manufacturers throughout the world that use our light source products in their photolithography systems  and that it is essential to maintain our own personnel or trained third party resources to provide these services 
accordingly  we have an ongoing effort to develop our direct support system with locations in the united states  japan  europe  korea  singapore  taiwan and the people s republic of china 
this requires us to do the following recruit and train qualified field service personnel  identify qualified independent firms  and maintain effective and highly trained organizations that can provide service to our customers in various countries 
we might not be able to attract and train qualified personnel to maintain our direct support operations successfully 
we may not be able to find and engage qualified third party resources to supplement and enhance our direct support operations 
further  we may incur significant costs in providing these support services 
failure to implement our direct support operation effectively could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
these types of claims could seriously harm our business or require us to incur significant costs 
we believe our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
as of december   we owned united states patents covering certain aspects of technology related to light sources and piezo techniques 
these patents will expire at various times during the period from january to april as of december   we also had applied for additional patents in the united states 
as of december   we owned foreign patents and had filed patent applications pending in various foreign countries 
our pending patent applications and any future applications might not be approved 
our patents might not provide us with a competitive advantage and may be challenged by third parties 
in addition  third parties patents might have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
as a result of cost constraints  we did not begin filing in japan and other countries our patents for inventions covered by united states patents and patent applications until as a result we lost the right to seek foreign patent protection for some of our early inventions 
additionally  laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
thus  the possibility of piracy of our technology and products are more likely in these countries 
further  third parties might independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or  design around patents that are granted to us 
other companies or persons may have filed or may file in the future patent applications that are similar or identical to ours 
we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office uspto in order for the patent office to determine the priority of inventions 
the patent office may determine that these third party patent applications have priority over our patent applications 
loss of priority in these interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to us 
we also rely on the following to protect our confidential information and our other intellectual property trade secret protection  employee nondisclosure agreements  third party nondisclosure agreements  and other intellectual property protection methods 
however  we may not be successful in protecting our confidential information and intellectual property  particularly our trade secrets  because third parties may independently develop substantially the same proprietary information and techniques  gain access to our trade secrets  or disclose our technology 
the parties to whom we provide research and development services may dispute the ownership of the intellectual property that we develop performing these services 
in the past  revenues from research and development arrangements with third parties have been used to pay for a portion of our own research and development expenses 
we receive these revenues from government sponsored programs  customers and from sematech  a research consortium  in connection with our designing and developing specific products 
currently  revenues from sematech  photolithography tool manufacturers and semiconductor manufacturers are used to fund a small portion of our development expenses 
in providing these research and development services to these manufacturers and sematech  we try to make clear who owns the intellectual property that results from the research and development services we perform 
however  disputes over the ownership or rights to use or market this intellectual property may arise between us and the photolithography tool manufacturers and sematech 
any dispute over ownership of the intellectual property we develop could restrict our ability to market our products and have a material adverse effect on our business 
in the future  we may be subject to patent litigation to enforce patents issued to us and defend ourselves against claimed infringement by our competitors or any other third party 
third parties have notified us in the past  and may notify us in the future  that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 
also  we have notified third parties in the past  and may notify them in the future  that they may be infringing our intellectual property rights 
specifically  komatsu has notified us that we may be infringing some of its japanese patents 
during our discussions with komatsu  they also asserted that we or our japanese manufacturing partner  seiko  may be infringing on some of komatsu s united states patents and a number of its additional japanese patents 
komatsu has also notified one of our customers  nikon  of its belief that our light sources infringe several of komatsu s japanese and us patents 
as a result  we started proceedings in the japanese patent office to oppose certain patents and patent applications of komatsu 
the japanese patent office has dismissed some of our opposition claims 
thus  litigation may result in connection with komatsu s japanese patents or us patents 
also  komatsu might claim that we infringe other or additional patents 
komatsu notified seiko  our manufacturing partner  that it intends to enforce its rights against seiko with respect to its japanese patents if seiko continues to engage in manufacturing activities for us 
in connection with our manufacturing agreement with seiko  we agree to pay seiko under certain conditions for damages associated with these types of claims 
seiko may not prevail in any litigation against komatsu  and therefore  we may be required to pay seiko for such damages 
we have notified our competitors and others of our united states patent portfolio 
specifically  we have notified komatsu that they may be infringing on some of our us patents 
we have discussed with komatsu our claims against each other 
komatsu challenged one of our us patents in the uspto but it was subsequently re issued by the uspto 
also  komatsu transferred its lithography light source business to one of our competitors  gigaphoton 
we also have had discussions with lambda physik  another competitor  regarding allegations by each party against the other for possible patent infringement 
any of these discussions with our competitors may not be successful and litigation could result 
in the future  patent litigation may result due to a claim of infringement by our competitors or any other third party or may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us 
any such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of effort by us  which would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  our customers and the end users of our products might assert other claims for indemnification that arise from infringement claims against them 
if these assertions are successful  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially affected 
instead of litigation  we may seek a license from third parties to use their intellectual property 
however  we may not be able to obtain a license on reasonable terms 
in the alternative  we may design around the third party s intellectual property right or we may challenge these claims in legal proceedings 
any adverse determination in a legal proceeding could result in one or more of the following  any of which could have a substantial adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results loss of our proprietary rights  exposure to significant liabilities by other third parties  requirement that we get a license from third parties on terms that are not favorable  or restriction from manufacturing or selling our products 
any of these actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of cymer s management and technical personnel  which would materially adversely affect cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
trademark infringement claims against our registered and unregistered trademarks would be expensive and we may have to stop using such trademarks and pay damages 
we registered the trademark cymer insist on cymer in the united states and in some other countries 
we are also trying to register additional trademarks in the united states in other countries 
we use these trademarks and many other marks in our advertisements and other business materials  which are distributed throughout the world 
we may be subject to trademark infringement actions for using these marks and other marks on a worldwide basis and this would be costly to defend 
if a trademark infringement action was successful  we would have to stop using the mark and possibly pay damages 
we are dependent on air transport to conduct our business and disruption of domestic and international air transport systems could adversely affect our business 
we depend on regular and reliable air transportation on a worldwide basis for many of our routine business functions 
if civil aviation in the united states or abroad is disrupted by terrorist activities or security responses to the threat of terrorism or for any other reason  our business could be adversely affected in the following ways supplies of raw materials and components for the manufacture of our products or our customers products may be disrupted  we may not be able to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner  we may not be able to provide timely support of installed light sources for semiconductor device manufacturers  and our sales and marketing efforts may be disrupted 
we are exposed to risks related to the fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for the japanese yen 
if we sell products to our japanese subsidiary  the sale is denominated in us dollars 
if our japanese subsidiary sells our products directly to customers in japan  the sale is denominated in japanese yen 
thus  our results of operations may fluctuate based on the changing value of the japanese yen to the us dollar 
our japanese subsidiary manages its exposure to these fluctuations through foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge its purchase commitments 
we will continue to monitor our exposure to these currency fluctuations  and  when appropriate  use hedging transactions to minimize the effect of these currency fluctuations 
however  exchange rate fluctuations may still have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in the future  we may need to sell our products in other foreign currencies other than the japanese yen and the management of more currency fluctuations will be more difficult and expose us to greater risks in this area 
we are subject to many standards and regulations of foreign governments and  even though we intend to comply  we may not always be in compliance with these rules  or we may be unable to design or redesign our products to comply with these rules 
many foreign government standards and regulations apply to our products 
these standards and regulations are always being amended 
although we intend to meet all foreign standards and regulations  our products may not comply with these foreign government standards and regulations 
further  it might not be cost effective for us to redesign our products to comply with these foreign government standards and regulations 
our inability to design or redesign products to comply with foreign standards therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 
semiconductor device manufacturers prolonged use of our products in high volume productions may not produce the results they desire and  as a result  our reputation and that of our customers who supply photolithography tools to the semiconductor manufacturers could be damaged in the semiconductor industry 
over time  our light source products may not meet semiconductor device manufacturers production specifications or operating cost requirements after the light source is used for a long period in high volume production 
if any semiconductor device manufacturer cannot successfully achieve or sustain their volume production using our light sources  our reputation could be damaged with the semiconductor device manufacturers and our customers who are the limited number of photolithography tool manufacturers 
this would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have in the past and may in the future acquire business that will involve numerous risks 
we may not be able to address these risks successfully without substantial expense  delay or other operational and financial problems 
the risks involved with acquiring a new company include the following diversion of management s attention and resources to integrate the new company  failure to retain key personnel  amortization of acquired definite lived intangible assets and deferred compensation  client dissatisfaction or performance problems with the acquired company  the cost associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired operations  failure to commercialize purchased technologies  ability of the acquired companies to meet their financial projections  and assumption of unknown liabilities or other unanticipated events or circumstances 
mergers and acquisitions are inherently subject to multiple significant risks  and the inability to effectively manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business 
any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
further  any business that we acquire may not achieve anticipated revenues or operating results 
we must develop and manufacture enhancements to our existing products and introduce new products in order to continue to grow our business 
we may not effectively manage our growth and integrate these new enhancements and products  which could materially harm our business 
to continue to grow our business  our existing light source products and their process capabilities must be enhanced  and we must develop and manufacture new products to serve other semiconductor applications 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to manage our growth effectively 
nor can we guarantee that we will be able to accelerate the development of new enhancements to our existing products and create new products 
further  we may not be able to effectively integrate new products and applications into our current operations 
any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on our manufacturing facilities and subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
operations at our primary manufacturing facility and our subcontractors are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons  including work stoppages  terrorism  fire  earthquake  energy shortages  flooding or other natural disasters 
such disruptions could cause delays in shipments of our products to our customers 
we cannot ensure that alternate production capacity would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that  if it were available  it could be obtained on favorable terms 
such disruption could result in cancellation of orders or loss of customers which have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
our operations are subject to environmental and other government regulations that may expose us to liabilities for noncompliance 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulations  such as regulations related to the environment  land use  public utility utilization and the fire code  in connection with the storage  handling  discharge and disposal of substances that we use in our manufacturing process and on our facilities that we lease 
we believe that our activities comply with current government regulations that are applicable to our operations and current facilities 
we may be required to purchase additional capital equipment or other requirements for our processes to comply with these government regulations in the future if they change 
further  these government regulations may restrict us from expanding our operations 
adopting measures to comply with changes in the government regulations  our failure to comply with environmental and land use regulations  or restrictions on our ability to discharge hazardous substances  could subject us to future liability or cause our manufacturing operations to be reduced or stopped 
our products are subject to potential product liability claims if personal injury or death result 
we are exposed to significant risks for product liability claims if personal injury or death results from the use of our products 
we may experience material product liability losses in the future 
we maintain insurance against product liability claims 
however  our insurance coverage may not continue to be available on terms that we accept 
this insurance coverage also may not adequately cover liabilities that we incur 
further  if our products are defective  we may be required to recall or redesign these products 
a successful claim against us that exceeds our insurance coverage level  or any claim or product recall that results in adverse publicity against us  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations  nasdaq stock market rules  and new accounting pronouncements are creating uncertainty and additional complexities for companies such as ours 
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure  we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards 
this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from strategic revenue generating and cost management activities 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past 
the market price of our common stock will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in the future in response to a variety of factors  including the risk factors contained in this report 
various factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock  including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  conditions and trends in the light source device and other technology industries  announcements of innovations in technology  new products offered by us or our competitors  developments of patents or proprietary rights  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  general worldwide political  economic  and market conditions  and united states political  economic  and market conditions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies 
such fluctuations have in some cases been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
severe price fluctuations in a company s stock have frequently been followed by securities litigation 
any such litigation can result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources and therefore could have a material adverse effect on cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have implemented steps to protect our company from hostile takeovers 
nevada law and our articles of incorporation contain provisions that discourage a proxy contest and provisions that make an acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock more difficult 
in addition  our board of directors is authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  shares of preferred stock 
such shares of preferred stock may have voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that may be superior to those of the common stock and this could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of holders of common stock 
our board can use the issuance of the preferred stock or rights to purchase the preferred stock to discourage any unsolicited acquisition proposal or attempt

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk cymer conducts business in several international currencies through its global operations 
due to the large volume of cymer s business that is conducted in japan  the japanese operation poses the greatest foreign currency risk 
cymer uses financial instruments  principally foreign currency forward exchange contracts  in japan to manage its foreign currency exposures 
cymer enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations related to purchases of cymer s inventories by cymer japan in us dollars for resale under firm third party sales commitments denominated in japanese yen 
cymer does not enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts for trading purposes 
as of december   cymer had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts to buy us million for billion yen under foreign currency exchange facilities with contract rates ranging from yen to yen per us dollar 
these contracts expire on various dates through november investment and debt risk cymer maintains an investment portfolio consisting primarily of government and corporate fixed income securities  certificates of deposit and commercial paper 
while it is cymer s general intent to hold such securities until maturity  cymer will occasionally sell certain securities for cash flow purposes 
therefore  cymer s investments are classified as available for sale and are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
due to the conservative nature of the investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
in february  cymer issued million principal amount of unsecured fixed rate convertible subordinated notes due february  notes 
interest on the notes is payable on february and august of each year  commencing august  the notes are convertible into shares of cymer s common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
cymer may redeem the notes on or after february   or earlier if the price of its common stock reaches certain levels 
the notes are subordinated to cymer s existing and future senior indebtedness and effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of cymer s subsidiaries 
a portion of the net proceeds of this private placement was used to redeem cymer s outstanding notes 
because the interest rate is fixed  we believe there is no risk of increased interest expense
