item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview harmonic designs  manufactures and sells a variety of broadband solutions that allow communications service providers around the world to deliver video  voice and data to their subscribers 
harmonic s technically advanced fiber optic  digital video and data delivery systems enable network operators to provide a range of interactive and advanced digital services that include digital video  high speed internet access  telephony  hdtv  video and audio streaming  and video on demand 
historically  almost all of our sales were derived directly or indirectly from sales of fiber optic transmission systems to cable television operators 
with the introduction of digital headend products beginning in  we have broadened our product offering to enable delivery of digital video  voice and data over satellite and wireless networks and cable systems 
in order to further expand our digital systems capability  harmonic acquired c cube microsystems inc in may  pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement dated october  under the terms of the merger agreement  c cube spun off its semiconductor business as a separate publicly traded company  which was subsequently acquired by lsi logic in june c cube merged into harmonic and harmonic therefore acquired c cube s divicom business  which provides encoding products and systems for digital television 
the merger was structured as a tax free exchange of stock and has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price  including merger related costs  was approximately billion 
as of december   the company determined that there was an impairment and recorded an impairment charge of billion  eliminating goodwill and reducing identified intangibles acquired to million 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the merged company has been organized into two operating divisions  broadband access networks  or ban  for fiber optic systems and convergent systems  or cs  for digital headend systems 
harmonic s net sales decreased in following a decrease in  and since the middle of  our sales have been well below pre merger levels achieved by harmonic and divicom in and early as industry capital spending has been and generally remains weak 
in addition  certain of our domestic and international customers have accumulated significant levels of debt and have announced in recent quarters  or are expected to announce  reorganizations and financial restructurings  including bankruptcy filings 
in particular  adelphia communications declared bankruptcy in june  and as a result  we have recorded only nominal revenue from adelphia since the first quarter of and established a million provision in the second quarter of for probable losses on receivables and deferred costs of sales determined to no longer be recoverable 
adelphia accounted for less than of our net sales in and less than of net sales in the stock prices of other domestic cable companies came under pressure following the adelphia communications bankruptcy due to concerns about debt levels and capital expenditure requirements for new and expanded services 
these issues may further restrict our customers access to capital and increase the cost of capital 
we believe that these capital market concerns about the cable industry and the associated pressures on capital spending contributed to the decrease in sales during the second half of compared to the first half of we expect our business with domestic cable customers to remain at reduced levels at least through the first quarter of in addition  spending by our domestic satellite customers and european customers was weak in  particularly in the second half of we believe that this was principally because of pending business consolidations  financial restructurings and regulatory issues 
for example  we believe that the regulatory review of the proposed acquisition of directv by echostar depressed spending in  particularly in the second half of during the fourth quarter the companies ultimately called off the proposed merger due to federal government opposition 
while directv announced in january that they would launch local channels in an additional markets  along with additional high definition services  there is continuing speculation about potential business combinations involving both directv and echostar 
any such transaction could negatively impact satellite capital spending in as a result of uncertain market conditions and lower sales during the second half of  the company implemented a series of cost control measures that included workforce reductions totaling approximately employees during the second half of harmonic recorded severance charges of million during the second half of related to the work force reductions 
this followed a workforce reduction of approximately during for which the company recorded severance and other costs of million at the time 
these actions reduced headcount from over at the end of to at the end of 
table of contents in light of the company s reduced headcount  difficult business conditions  and a weak local commercial real estate market  we reassessed our accrual for the costs of excess facilities and recorded a charge of million during the third quarter of we changed our estimates with regard to the expected timing and amount of sublease income due to the substantial and growing surplus of vacant space in the san francisco bay area 
the excess facilities charge recorded during the third quarter of was for facilities that we no longer occupied  do not intend to occupy  plan to sublease  and followed charges of million recorded for excess facilities in when the initial accruals were established 
our operating results in also included charges of million for excess and obsolete inventories and million for fixed asset impairment 
the provisions for excess and obsolete inventories resulted from significant reductions in the demand for our products  principally ban division products 
in accordance with our policy  we wrote down inventory levels in excess of our demand forecasts 
historically  a majority of our net sales have been to relatively few customers  and due in part to the consolidation of ownership of cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems  we expect this customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future 
in  sales to charter communications and comcast accounted for and of net sales  respectively 
if comcast  which acquired at t broadband in november  and at t broadband had been combined for all of  total revenues would have been of net sales 
charter represented of net sales in and at t broadband represented of sales in in addition  in  rcn represented of net sales 
we expect sales to charter to be significantly lower in  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue  as it is now in the latter stages of its network upgrade program 
in addition  our sales to charter may be impacted by capital market concerns about the cable industry  in the aftermath of the adelphia communications bankruptcy filing in june  and concerns about the financial condition of charter  particularly its significant level of debt 
as of december   harmonic had accounts receivable of million due from charter  which was subsequently collected 
in  and  sales of ban products accounted for approximately  and of net sales  respectively  while cs products accounted for approximately  and of net sales  respectively 
cs sales prior to the merger in may consisted of sales of our transend and cyberstream product lines 
sales to customers outside of the united states in  and represented  and of net sales  respectively 
a significant portion of international sales are made to distributors and system integrators  which are generally responsible for importing the products and providing installation and technical support and service to customers within their territory 
we expect international sales to continue to account for a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
harmonic often recognizes a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of the quarter 
harmonic establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of harmonic s business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
harmonic s expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations  our operating results may be adversely impacted by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result of these and other factors  harmonic s operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 
due to lower than expected sales in several quarters during and  and the third quarter of  harmonic failed to meet the expectations of securities analysts  and the price of our common stock declined  in some cases significantly 
see factors that may affect results of future operations our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures requires harmonic to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and expenses if different judgments or different estimates were made 
see note of notes to 
table of contents consolidated financial statements for details of harmonic s accounting policies 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates which we believe have the most significant impact on harmonic s financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts  valuation of inventories  impairment of long lived assets  restructuring costs and accruals for excess facilities  assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition harmonic recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and risk of loss and title has transferred to the customer 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment  and allowances are provided for estimated returns and discounts 
such allowances are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated experience 
revenue on solution sales  which principally include the design  manufacture  test  integration and installation of equipment to our customers specifications  or acquired from third parties to be integrated with our products  is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue recognized reflects the portion of the anticipated contract revenue that has been earned  equal to the ratio of labor costs expended to date to anticipated final labor costs  based on current estimates of labor costs to complete the project 
if the estimated costs to complete a project exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss is recognized 
revenue from services is generally recognized as services are performed 
maintenance services are recognized ratably over the maintenance term  which is typically one year 
deferred revenue represents billings in excess of revenue recognized 
revenue recognition in each period is dependent on our application of these accounting policies 
if we believe that any of the conditions to recognize revenue has not been met  we defer revenue recognition 
for example  if collectibility is not reasonably assured we defer revenue recognition until subsequent cash receipt 
our application of percentage of completion accounting is subject to our estimates of labor costs to complete each project 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results for a particular period could be adversely affected 
allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts we establish allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts based on credit profiles of our customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions and historical payment  return and discount experience  as well as for known or expected events 
if there were to be a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness or if actual defaults  returns or discounts were higher than our historical experience our operating results and financial position could be adversely affected 
valuation of inventories harmonic states inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we establish provisions for excess and obsolete inventories after evaluation of historical sales and future demand and market conditions  expected product lifecycles and current inventory levels 
in the event that we adjust our estimates  such as future demand and expected product lifecycles  our operating results and financial position could be adversely affected 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we perform an evaluation of the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets whenever we become aware of an event or change in circumstances that would indicate potential impairment 
we evaluate the recoverability of other intangible assets and long lived assets on the basis of undiscounted cash flows from each asset group 
if impairment is indicated  provisions for impairment are determined based on fair value  principally using discounted cash flows 
changes in industry and market conditions or the strategic realignment of our resources could result in an impairment of identified intangibles or long lived assets 
there can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
restructuring costs and accruals for excess facilities for restructuring activities initiated prior to december  we recorded restructuring costs when harmonic committed to an exit plan and significant changes to the exit plan were not likely 
to determine our excess facility accrual we estimate expected sublease rental income on each excess facility 
in the event we are unable to achieve expected levels of sublease rental income  we will need to revise our estimate of the liability which could materially impact our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
for restructuring activities initiated after december  we will follow statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  as discussed under new accounting pronouncements below 
assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation harmonic records accruals for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
based on harmonic s review of the complaints filed in the securities class action and other pending litigation  harmonic believes that it has meritorious defenses and  accordingly  no loss contingencies have been accrued 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will prevail 
an unfavorable outcome of these legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  operating results and liquidity 
accounting for income taxes in preparation of our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current tax exposures and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
based on our judgment that the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income is not assured  we established a valuation allowance of million in which was increased to million in at december  we have fully reserved for our net deferred tax assets related to temporary differences  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 

table of contents results of operations harmonic s historical consolidated statements of operations data for each of the three years ended december    and as a percentage of net sales  are as follows fiscal year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative impairment of goodwill and other intangibles amortization of intangibles acquired in process technology total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net loss net sales harmonic s net sales decreased to million in  from million in the lower net sales were due to a decrease in cs division sales  partially offset by a increase in ban division sales 
the cs sales decrease was principally attributable to significantly lower sales of encoders to domestic satellite customers 
we believe these lower sales were due  in part  to purchasing delays created by the uncertainty of the regulatory review of the proposed acquisition of directv by echostar  which was ultimately called off in the fourth quarter 
the lower cs division sales to satellite customers were partially offset by higher sales of the narrowcast services gateway  or nsg  for video on demand deployments to cable operators 
with regard to the ban division  the modest increase was due to higher sales of node products  partially offset by lower transmitter sales  and generally higher unit volumes  offset by lower pricing 
international sales represented of net sales in  compared to in reflecting a decrease in international sales 
this international sales decrease was partially offset by a increase in domestic sales 
the significant decrease in international sales was due principally to depressed market conditions  particularly in europe  which impacted both divisions 
harmonic s net sales decreased to million in  from million in the lower net sales were due to a decrease in ban sales partially offset by a increase in cs sales 
the significant decrease in ban sales in was principally due to weak capital spending on transmission upgrades  particularly reduced capital spending by at t broadband and rcn 
these two customers accounted for a combined total of less than of net sales in compared to a combined total of of net sales in the significant increase in cs sales during was principally due to sales of new next generation digital products including the mv encoder and narrowcast services gateway  or nsg  which commenced volume shipment in the second quarter of this increase was also attributable to the fact that net sales for included only eight months of sales for the divicom business as the c cube merger was accounted for as a purchase transaction and closed on may  international sales represented of net sales in  compared to in the increase was principally due to the higher international sales mix of the divicom business 
gross profit gross profit increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to special charges in of million  principally for excess and obsolete inventories  and credits in of million related to products sold for which the cost basis had been written down in prior years 
also contributing to the higher gross profit in were cost control measures  including a reduction in headcount in the factory and technical service and support organizations  associated with work force reductions throughout 
table of contents and during the second half of these factors which contributed to higher gross margins in compared to  were partially offset by lower pricing and a higher proportion of ban division revenue which historically has had lower margins 
gross profit decreased to million of net sales in  from million of net sales in the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to decreased sales and associated lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower production levels and purchasing volumes 
also contributing to the lower gross profit and margins in were lower pricing and changes in product mix 
in addition  approximately million of the reduction in gross profit was attributable to the recording of provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  the impairment of certain fixed assets and severance and other costs resulting from streamlining our product lines in both divisions 
the provisions for excess and obsolete inventories of million resulted from significant reductions in demand for our products  principally ban division products 
in accordance with our policy we established provisions for inventory levels in excess of our demand forecasts 
the decreases in gross profit and gross margins were partially offset by the inclusion of divicom for the entire year in research and development research and development expenses decreased to million of net sales in  from million of net sales in the decreases in were primarily due to a reduction in headcount associated with the workforce reductions over the past two years and ongoing cost control measures 
research and development expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to inclusion of divicom for the entire year in  which historically spent a higher percentage of net sales on research and development than harmonic  partially offset by lower headcount and associated expenses 
in  the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to decreased net sales  but also attributable to the inclusion of divicom for the entire year 
sales  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million of net sales in  from million of net sales in the decreases were due principally to the reduction in headcount associated with the work force reductions and to lower promotional costs 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses in included excess facilities charges of million compared to million in selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in absolute dollars was due principally to million of excess facility  severance and other costs  and the inclusion of divicom for the entire year in  partially offset by lower headcount and associated expenses 
the increase as a percentage of net sales was also attributable to the decrease in net sales 
amortization and impairment of intangibles amortization of intangibles decreased to million in from million in the decrease in was due principally to cessation of goodwill amortization on adoption of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective january  harmonic expects to record approximately million in amortization of intangibles in amortization of intangibles decreased to million in  from million in the decrease in was due to the recording of an impairment charge of billion as of december  to write down long lived assets associated with the acquisition of the divicom business completed in may divicom was acquired in a tax free exchange of stock at a time when the market values of telecommunications equipment manufacturers were substantially higher 
the divicom business had experienced a significant decrease in the demand for its products and services as customers in the digital headend systems market reduced levels of current and planned capital expenditures and  as a result  revenues  cash flows and expected future growth rates decreased 
due to these significant changes  management performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the goodwill and other long lived assets related to the divicom business in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
because the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of this operation were less than the carrying value of the related long lived assets as of december   an impairment charge was required 
the impairment charge represents the amount required to write down long lived assets to fair value based on management s best estimate of this operation s future 
table of contents discounted cash flows 
as a result of the impairment charge  harmonic wrote off the remaining unamortized goodwill and reduced the recorded value of other identified intangibles related to its acquisition of the divicom business to million 
acquired in process technology harmonic recorded charges to operations of million in for acquired in process technology in connection with the c cube merger and cogent acquisition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these amounts were expensed on the acquisition dates in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  was million in  million in and million in the decrease in was due principally to lower interest income  and to a lesser extent higher interest expense on borrowings under harmonic s equipment term loan 
the decrease in interest income was due to lower average cash and short term investment balances as well as lower interest rates 
the decrease in was principally due to lower average cash and short term investments 
lower interest rates also contributed to the decrease 
income taxes harmonic recorded a provision for income taxes of million in principally due to foreign income taxes despite a loss before income taxes of million 
the valuation allowance was increased from million in to million in the valuation allowance is for the full amount of the net deferred tax asset  because realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences  net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards was uncertain at december  harmonic recorded a benefit from income taxes of only million despite a loss before income taxes of million in this was principally due to the establishment of the valuation allowance for the full amount of harmonic s net deferred tax assets of million 
for  harmonic recorded a benefit from income taxes of only million  principally due to non deductible goodwill impairment and amortization  and acquired in process technology related to the acquisition of divicom 
in  harmonic expects to record a provision for income taxes of less than million due principally to foreign income taxes 
this estimate is based on current tax laws  current estimates of operating results and the expected distribution of income among various tax jurisdictions  all of which is subject to change 
in addition  harmonic is liable for c cube s taxes for periods prior to the merger 
see factors that may affect future results of operations we are liable for c cube s pre merger tax liabilities  including tax liabilities resulting from the spin off of its semiconductor business 
segments harmonic s management uses income or loss from segment operations as its measure of segment profitability 
income or loss from segment operations excludes intangible amortization expense  corporate expenses  including excess facilities charges  and interest and other income 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in net sales by operating segment are discussed more extensively in the section above entitled  net sales 
with regard to losses from segment operations  ban had a loss of million in compared to a loss of million in the improved results in were due to a increase in sales  improved factory absorption and lower operating expenses  resulting primarily from lower headcount 
in addition  ban results included special charges in of million for excess and obsolete inventories and credits of million in related to products sold in for which the cost basis had been written down in prior years 
ban had a loss from segment operations of million in compared to million in the larger loss in was due primarily to a decrease in sales and the recording of special charges impacting gross profits as discussed above 
cs had a loss from segment operations of million in compared to a loss of million in despite a decrease in sales in  results improved  principally due to lower headcount and other cost control measures 
in addition  cs results included special charges for excess and obsolete inventories in of million and credits of million in related to products sold in for which the cost basis had been written down in prior years 
cs had a loss from segment operations of million in compared to a loss of million in despite a increase in sales  the loss from segment operations increased in due in part to the special charges for excess and obsolete 
table of contents inventories which impacted gross profits 
in addition  results only included eight months of operating results for the divicom business as the c cube merger closed on may  liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million compared to million as of december  cash used in operations was million in compared to million in the reduced use of cash in operations in was due to a significantly reduced net loss that was substantially offset by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and net cash provided through improved working capital management 
cash used in operations in was primarily due to the significant net loss  partially offset by depreciation and amortization  and net cash provided through improved working capital management compared to during  harmonic received income tax refunds of million  principally due to pre merger tax liabilities 
under the terms of the merger agreement with c cube  harmonic is generally liable for c cube s pre merger tax liabilities 
as of december   approximately million of pre merger tax liabilities remain outstanding and are included in accrued liabilities 
harmonic expects to negotiate final settlement and make payment of these obligations to a variety of taxing authorities or to lsi logic during to the extent that these obligations are finally settled for less than the amount provided  harmonic is required  under the terms of the merger agreement  to refund the difference to lsi logic 
accordingly  we expect a significant reduction in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during additions to property  plant and equipment were million during compared to million in the decrease from was due principally to expenditures during for leasehold improvements and related furniture  fixtures and equipment in connection with relocation of former divicom employees to new facilities in sunnyvale  and the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning software system 
these major capital programs commenced during the second half of and were substantially completed during the first half of as a result of these major programs  capital expenditures for the combined company were significantly higher during and than historic levels  in  and levels expected in the future 
harmonic currently expects capital expenditures to be less than million during the company s previous credit facility  as modified in november  provided for borrowings up to million including million for equipment under a secured term loan  contained financial and other covenants and expired in march under the november modification agreement  a minimum cash covenant was established which required the company to maintain at least of its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments with the bank 
the company was granted a grace period until january  to satisfy this covenant 
after giving effect to this grace period  harmonic was in compliance with the covenants under the previous credit facility as of december  during  harmonic borrowed an additional million under the secured equipment term loan portion of this facility 
as of december   million was outstanding under the equipment term loan portion of this facility 
the term loan interest rates were to annually on outstanding borrowings as of december  borrowings under the facility mature at various dates through july other than standby letters of credit and guarantees set forth in the contractual obligations and other commercial commitments table below  there were no other outstanding borrowings or commitments under the line as of december  in march  harmonic entered into a new bank line of credit facility with silicon valley bank  which provides for borrowings up to million including million for equipment under a secured term loan 
this new facility  which expires in march  contains financial and other covenants including the requirement for harmonic to maintain on deposit with the bank the greater of of total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments or million  or satisfy a liquidity covenant requirement in the event cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are less than million 
if harmonic is unable to maintain on deposit with the bank the minimum balance of million  or satisfy the liquidity covenant requirement  harmonic would be in noncompliance with the facility 
in the event of noncompliance by harmonic with the covenants under the facility  silicon valley bank would be entitled to exercise its remedies under the facility  including in the event amounts are outstanding under the facility  offset rights against the amounts harmonic has maintained on deposit with the bank 
future borrowings pursuant to the line bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus prime rate plus for equipment borrowings depending upon the company s total cash position 
borrowings are payable monthly  and are collateralized by all of harmonic s assets 
the company has entered into an agreement with a financial institution holding amounts on deposit to allow  in the event of default  silicon valley bank to control these deposits 

table of contents harmonic also has a facility with silicon valley bank that provides for the sale of trade receivables on a non recourse basis up to million and expires in march trade receivables sold under the facility are discounted based on the bank s prime rate plus for north american customers and at a negotiated rate for all other customers 
this facility  which was amended in march  was not utilized in the company s ability to utilize both facilities with silicon valley bank depends to a significant extent on having a sufficient amount of qualified receivables  which may fluctuate depending on the level and timing of sales and the aging  customer concentration  international mix and credit quality of receivables 
to the extent that the company does not have sufficient qualified receivables  our ability to utilize these facilities could be significantly constrained 
based upon current levels of receivables  the company believes that it would not be able to utilize a significant portion of these facilities at this time 
future payments under contractual obligations  and other commercial commitments  as of december   were as follows in thousands payments due by period total amounts less than over contractual obligations committed year years years years long term debt c cube pre merger tax liabilities operating leases inventory purchase commitments total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial total amounts less than over commitments committed year years years years standby letters of credit indemnifications guarantees total commercial commitments operating lease commitments include million of accrued excess facilities costs 
harmonic indemnifies some of its suppliers and customers for specified intellectual property rights pursuant to certain parameters and restrictions 
the scope of these indemnities varies  but in some instances  includes indemnification for damages and expenses including reasonable attorneys fees 
no amounts have been accrued in respect of the indemnification provisions at december  harmonic s cash and investment balances declined million in the fourth quarter of after increasing million through the first three quarters of we currently believe that our existing liquidity sources  including our bank line of credit and trade receivables facilities  as limited by qualified receivables  will satisfy our requirements for at least the next twelve months  including the final settlement and payment of c cube s pre merger tax liabilities 
however  we may need to raise additional funds if our expectations or estimates change or prove inaccurate  or to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or to strengthen our financial position 
because our stock is currently trading at near historically low levels  any financing at these levels could be significantly dilutive to existing shareholders 
on march   harmonic filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  or sec 
this shelf registration statement  which was declared effective by the sec in april  will allow harmonic to issue various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock from time to time  up to an aggregate of million  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
in addition  from time to time  we review potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings  enhance our technical capabilities or expand our marketing and sales presence 
any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital or could require us to issue our stock and dilute existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 

table of contents our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to harmonic  as well as factors beyond our control  including increased market uncertainty surrounding the ongoing us war on terrorism  and the outbreak of war in iraq  as well as conditions in capital markets and the cable and satellite industries 
there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
see factors that may affect future results of operations we may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard replaces emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  upon adoption  we do not expect a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires the guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
it also expands on the disclosures by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued and to be made in regard to product warranties 
disclosures required under fin are included in these financial statements  however  the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we are evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company believes that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on its financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses accounting for the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
prior to the issuance of fin  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin now requires a variable interest entity  as defined in fin  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the company does not believe that the adoption of fin will have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that may affect future results of operations we depend on cable and satellite industry capital spending for a substantial portion of our revenue and any decrease or delay in capital spending in these industries would negatively impact our resources  operating results and financial condition and cash flows 
prior to the merger with c cube in may  almost all of harmonic s historic sales had been derived from sales to cable television operators and we expect these sales to constitute a significant portion of net sales for the foreseeable future 
almost all of the divicom business historic sales had been derived from sales to satellite operators  telephone companies and cable operators 
demand for our products will depend on the magnitude and timing of capital spending by cable television operators  satellite operators  broadcasters and telephone companies for constructing and upgrading of their systems 

table of contents these capital spending patterns are dependent on a variety of factors  including access to financing  annual budget cycles  the impact of industry consolidation  the status of federal  local and foreign government regulation of telecommunications and television broadcasting  overall demand for communication services and the acceptance of new video  voice and data services  evolving industry standards and network architectures  competitive pressures  discretionary customer spending patterns  and general economic conditions 
in the past  specific factors contributing to reduced capital spending have included uncertainty related to development of digital video and cable modem industry standards  delays associated with the evaluation of new services and system architectures by many cable television operators  emphasis on generating revenue from existing customers by cable television operators instead of new construction or network upgrades  proposed business combinations by our customers and regulatory review thereof  and economic and financial conditions in domestic and international markets 
developments in capital markets over the past several years have reduced access to funding for new and existing customers  causing delays in the timing and scale of deployments of our equipment  as well as the postponement or cancellation of certain projects by our customers 
our business has been negatively impacted by the prolonged economic recession 
during this same period harmonic and other vendors received notification from several customers that they were canceling new projects  or delaying new orders to allow them to reduce inventory levels which were in excess of their current deployment requirements 
certain of our customers have accumulated significant levels of debt and have announced during the past year  or are expected to announce  reorganizations and financial restructurings  including bankruptcy filings 
for example  two of our major domestic customers  adelphia communications and winfirst  declared bankruptcy during the first half of  while ntl  a major international customer  has just recently emerged from bankruptcy 
even if these restructurings are completed  we cannot assure you that these customers will be in a position to purchase new equipment at levels we have seen in the past 
our business has been negatively impacted by the prolonged economic recession and the bankruptcy of adelphia communications has further heightened concerns in the financial markets about the domestic cable industry 
these concerns  coupled with the current uncertain and volatile capital markets  have further pressured the market values of domestic cable operators and may further restrict their access to capital 
the timing of deployment of our equipment can be subject to a number of other risks  including the availability of skilled engineering and technical personnel  the availability of other equipment such as digital set top boxes  and the need for local franchise and licensing approvals 
we believe that changes in our customers deployment plans have in recent quarters delayed  and may in the future delay  the receipt of new orders or the release of existing backlog 

table of contents cable television capital spending can be subject to the effects of seasonality  with fewer construction and upgrade projects typically occurring in winter months and otherwise being affected by inclement weather 
ban division sales have decreased significantly from the third quarter of and were lower in than in this was due in particular to reduced spending by at t broadband  which was acquired by comcast in november  and rcn 
these two customers accounted for a combined total of of sales in compared to a combined total of less than of sales in while ban sales increased in  sales generally remain weak 
for a more detailed discussion regarding risks related to comcast  and other major customers  see our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would harm our business 
the loss of any key customer would have a negative effect on our business 
cs division sales from the second quarter of through the first quarter of  consisting principally of divicom products  were below divicom s sales levels in and the first quarter of  and were significantly below our expectations at the time the divicom merger was announced in october the lower cs sales were attributable principally to reduced spending by satellite operators 
cs division sales increased significantly from the first quarter of through the second quarter of due principally to demand for our next generation digital systems such as the narrowcast services gateway  or nsg  for video on demand deployments  and the mv encoder 
cs sales of the mv encoder benefited during this period from the expansion of local channel offerings and compliance with fcc must carry regulations by domestic direct broadcast satellite  or dbs  operators 
however  cs sales decreased during the second half of compared to the first half of due principally to significantly lower sales to cable and satellite customers 
we believe this decrease was the result  in part  of the prolonged regulatory review of the proposed acquisition of directv by echostar  a pause in nsg shipments as most major domestic cable operators focused on initial vod service launches rather than new vod deployments  and reduced cable industry spending in the aftermath of the adelphia bankruptcy filing 
due to more challenging market conditions during the second half of  and uncertainty about the capital spending plans of certain of our domestic and international cable and satellite customers  it is difficult to estimate growth in the markets in which we participate 
accordingly  harmonic expects sales to remain at levels similar to the second half of through at least the first quarter of our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would harm our business 
the loss of any key customer would have a negative effect on our business 
historically  a majority of our sales have been to relatively few customers  and due in part to the consolidation of ownership of cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems  we expect this customer concentration to continue in the foreseeable future 
sales to our ten largest customers in   and accounted for approximately  and of net sales  respectively 
although we are attempting to broaden our customer base by penetrating new markets such as the telco and broadcast markets  we expect to see continuing industry consolidation and customer concentration due in part to the significant capital costs of constructing broadband networks 
for example  comcast acquired at t broadband in november  thereby creating the largest us cable operator  reaching approximately million subscribers 
in the dbs segment  the proposed acquisition of directv by echostar was opposed by the fcc and the justice department  and the two companies have subsequently called off the merger 
however  speculation regarding potential business combinations of both directv and echostar continues 
in addition  financial restructurings of companies such as adelphia communications and several european operators may lead to further industry consolidation 
in  sales to charter communications and comcast accounted for and of net sales  respectively 
if comcast and at t broadband had been combined for all of  total revenues would have been of net sales 
charter represented of net sales in and at t broadband represented of sales in in addition  in rcn represented of net sales 
the loss of charter communications or comcast or  any other significant customer or any reduction in orders by charter communications or comcast  or any significant customer  or our failure to qualify our products with a significant customer could adversely affect our business  operating results and liquidity 
in this regard sales to charter communications are expected to be significantly lower in  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue  as they are now in the latter stages of their network upgrade program 
in addition  our sales to charter may be impacted by capital market concerns about the cable industry and charter in the aftermath of the adelphia communications bankruptcy filing in june 
table of contents we cannot currently predict the impact of the acquisition of at t broadband by comcast on our future sales nor can we predict the impact of the continuing speculation surrounding the sale of directv by hughes on our future sales 
our sales are made on a purchase order or system contract basis  and none of our customers has entered into a long term agreement requiring it to purchase our products 
the loss of  or any reduction in orders from  a significant customer would harm our business 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future  on an annual and a quarterly basis  as a result of several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that may cause these fluctuations include the level and timing of capital spending of our customers  both in the us and in foreign markets  changes in market demand  the timing and amount of orders  especially from significant customers  the timing of revenue from systems contracts which may span several quarters  competitive market conditions  our unpredictable sales cycles  new product introductions by our competitors or by us  changes in domestic and international regulatory environments  market acceptance of new or existing products  the cost and availability of components  subassemblies and modules  the mix of our customer base and sales channels  the mix of our products sold  our development of custom products and software  the level of international sales  and economic and financial conditions specific to the cable and satellite industries  and general economic conditions 
in addition  we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of the quarter 
we establish our expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of our business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
our expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations  our operating results may be adversely impacted by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result of all these factors  our operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 
in this regard  due to lower than expected sales in several quarters during and  and during the third quarter of  we failed to meet our internal expectations  as well as the expectations of securities analysts and investors  and the price of our common stock declined  in some cases significantly 

table of contents the terrorist attacks of  the war in iraq and the ongoing threat of terrorism have created great uncertainty and may continue to harm our business 
current conditions in the us and global economies are uncertain 
the terrorist attacks in created many economic and political uncertainties that have severely impacted the global economy 
we experienced a further decline in demand for our products after the attacks 
the long term effects of the attacks  the war in iraq and the ongoing war on terrorism on our business and on the global economy remain unknown 
moreover  the potential for future terrorist attacks has created additional uncertainty and makes it difficult to estimate how quickly the us and other economies will recover and our business will improve 
we may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us 
harmonic s cash and investment balances declined million in the fourth quarter of after increasing million through the first three quarters of we currently believe that our existing liquidity sources  including our bank line of credit and trade receivables sale facilities  will satisfy our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we may need to raise additional funds if our estimates change or prove inaccurate  or in order for us to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or to strengthen our financial position 
because our stock is currently trading at near historically low levels  any financing at these levels could be significantly dilutive to existing shareholders 
on march   harmonic filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  or sec 
this shelf registration statement  which was declared effective by the sec in april  will allow harmonic to issue various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock from time to time  up to an aggregate of million  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to harmonic  as well as factors beyond our control  including increased market uncertainty following the events of september   the outbreak of war in iraq  and the ongoing us war on terrorism as well as conditions in capital markets 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  from time to time  we review potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings  enhance our technical capabilities or expand our marketing and sales presence 
any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital to finance the acquisition and related expenses as well as to integrate operations following a transaction  and could require us to issue our stock and dilute existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
we depend on our international sales and are subject to the risks associated with international operations  which may negatively affect our operating results 
sales to customers outside of the united states in  and represented  and  of net sales  respectively  and we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks  including changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  import and export license requirements  tariffs  taxes and other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  treaties and technical standards  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  and political and economic instability 

table of contents certain of our international customers have accumulated significant levels of debt and have recently announced  or are expected to announce  reorganizations and financial restructurings  including bankruptcy filings 
even if these restructurings are completed  we cannot assure you that these customers will be in a position to purchase new equipment at levels we have seen in the past 
while our international sales and operations have typically been denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
following implementation of the euro in january  a higher portion of our european business is denominated in euros  which may subject us to increased foreign currency risk 
gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in operating results 
furthermore  payment cycles for international customers are typically longer than those for customers in the united states 
unpredictable sales cycles could cause us to fail to meet or exceed the expectations of security analysts and investors for any given period 
in addition  foreign markets may not develop in the future 
if sales forecasted for a particular period are not realized in that period due to the unpredictable sales cycles of our products  our operating results for that period will be harmed 
the sales cycles of many of our products  particularly our newer products and products sold internationally  are typically unpredictable and usually involve a significant technical evaluation  a commitment of capital and other resources by cable  satellite  and other network operators  time required to engineer the deployment of new technologies or new broadband services  testing and acceptance of new technologies that affect key operations  and test marketing of new services with subscribers 
for these and other reasons  our sales cycles generally last three to six months  but can last up to months 
if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter do not occur in that quarter  our operating results for that quarter could be substantially lower than anticipated 
as a result of the merger with c cube  a significant portion of our revenue is derived from solution contracts that include a combination of product sales as well as design  installation and integration services 
revenue forecasts for solution contracts are based on the estimated timing of the design  installation and integration of projects 
because the solution contracts generally span several quarters and revenue recognition is based on progress under the contract  the timing of revenue is difficult to predict and could result in lower than expected revenue in any particular quarter 
we face risks associated with having important facilities and resources located in israel 
harmonic maintains a facility in caesarea in the state of israel with a total of approximately employees  or of our workforce 
the employees at this facility consist principally of research and development personnel involved in development of certain products for the cs division 
in addition  we have pilot production capabilities at this facility consisting of procurement of subassemblies and modules from israeli subcontractors and final assembly and test operations 
accordingly  we are directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel  and any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its trading partners could significantly harm our business 
the september terrorist attacks  the war in iraq  the ongoing us war on terrorism and the escalation of terrorist attacks and hostilities within israel have heightened these risks 
we cannot assure you that the protraction or escalation of current tensions in the middle east will not adversely affect our business and results of operations 

table of contents in addition  most of our employees in israel are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and several have been called for active military duty recently 
we cannot predict the effect of these obligations on harmonic in the future 
pending business combinations and other financial and regulatory issues among our customers could adversely affect our business 
the telecommunications industry has been particularly impacted by the prolonged economic recession  adverse conditions in capital markets and financial difficulties in both the service and equipment sectors  including bankruptcies 
although large telecommunications service providers such as worldcom and troubled data and voice oriented start ups have not been traditional customers of harmonic  the cable  satellite and broadcast sectors have experienced significant financial problems 
many of our domestic and international customers have accumulated significant levels of debt and have announced in recent quarters  or are expected to announce  reorganizations and financial restructurings  including bankruptcy filings 
in particular  adelphia communications  a major domestic cable operator  declared bankruptcy in june the stock prices of other domestic cable companies came under pressure following the adelphia bankruptcy due to concerns about debt levels and capital expenditure requirements for new and expanded services  thereby making the raising of capital more difficult and expensive 
new competitors  such as rcn and winfirst  also had difficulty in accessing capital markets 
winfirst subsequently filed for bankruptcy 
in europe  rapid consolidation of the cable industry through acquisition also led to significant levels of debt at the major msos  and companies such as ntl and upc commenced bankruptcy proceedings 
european digital broadcasters  such as itv digital  kirsch and quiero  have also filed for protection from creditors 
while the capital market concerns about the domestic cable industry have eased somewhat since the summer of  market conditions remain difficult and capital spending plans are generally constrained 
it is likely that further industry restructuring will take place via mergers or spin offs  such as the recent comcast at t broadband transaction and the proposed spin off of time warner cable from aol time warner 
in addition  echostar and directv  whose recent merger agreement was abandoned due to opposition from federal regulatory agencies  remain the subject of speculation about other potential mergers or acquisitions 
regulatory issues  financial concerns and business combinations among our customers are likely to significantly affect the industry  its capital spending plans  and our levels of business for the foreseeable future 
we must be able to manage expenses and inventory risks associated with meeting the demand of our customers 
from time to time  we receive indications from our customers as to their future plans and requirements to ensure that we will be prepared to meet their demand for our products 
if actual orders differ materially from these indications  our ability to manage inventory and expenses may be affected 
in addition  if we fail to meet customers supply expectations  we may lose business from such customers 
if we enter into purchase commitments to acquire materials  or expend resources to manufacture products and such products are not purchased by our customers  our business and operating results could suffer 
in this regard  our gross margins and operating results for the fourth quarter of and in were adversely affected by provisions for excess and obsolete inventories of approximately million 
the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and many of our competitors are larger and more established 
the markets for cable television fiber optics systems and digital video broadcasting systems are extremely competitive and have been characterized by rapid technological change and declining average selling prices 
harmonic s competitors in the cable television fiber optics systems business include corporations such as c cor 
net which recently acquired philips fiber optics systems business  motorola  and scientific atlanta 
in the digital and video broadcasting systems business  we compete broadly with vertically integrated system suppliers including motorola  scientific atlanta  tandberg television and thomson multimedia  and in certain product lines with cisco and a number of smaller companies 
many of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than harmonic 
many of these large organizations are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by customers in these markets 
they often have broader product lines and market focus and may not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market 
in addition  many of our competitors have been in operation longer than we have and therefore have more long standing and established relationships with domestic and foreign customers 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future which may harm our business 

table of contents if any of our competitors products or technologies were to become the industry standard  our business could be seriously harmed 
for example  us cable operators have to date mostly purchased proprietary digital systems from motorola and scientific atlanta 
while certain operators have made limited purchases of the open systems provided by harmonic  we cannot assure you that our digital products will find broad market acceptance with us cable operators 
in addition  companies that have historically not had a large presence in the broadband communications equipment market have begun recently to expand their market share through mergers and acquisitions 
the continued consolidation of our competitors could have a significant negative impact on us 
further  our competitors  particularly competitors of our digital and video broadcasting systems business  may bundle their products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products or which may require us to lower our selling prices resulting in lower gross margins 
broadband communications markets are characterized by rapid technological change 
broadband communications markets are relatively immature  making it difficult to accurately predict the markets future growth rates  sizes or technological directions 
in view of the evolving nature of these markets  it is possible that cable television operators  telephone companies or other suppliers of broadband wireless and satellite services will decide to adopt alternative architectures or technologies that are incompatible with our current or future products 
if we are unable to design  develop  manufacture and sell products that incorporate or are compatible with these new architectures or technologies  our business will suffer 
we need to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner to remain competitive 
broadband communications markets are characterized by continuing technological advancement  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
to compete successfully  we must design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability 
however  we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce these products  if our products are not cost effective  are not brought to market in a timely manner  are not in accordance with evolving industry standards and architectures  or fail to achieve market acceptance  or are ahead of the market 
also  to successfully develop and market certain of our planned products for digital applications  we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into any necessary technology development or licensing agreement on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the failure to enter into technology development or licensing agreements when necessary could limit our ability to develop and market new products and  accordingly  could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
we need to effectively manage our operations and the cyclical nature of our business 
the cyclical nature of our business has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our personnel  management and other resources 
this strain has been exacerbated by the acquisition of divicom and the subsequent loss of numerous employees  including senior management 
in addition  we reduced our work force by approximately since the beginning of due to reduced industry spending and demand for our products 
our ability to manage our business effectively in the future  including any future growth  will require us to train  motivate and manage our employees successfully  to attract and integrate new employees into our overall operations  to retain key employees and to continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems 
in particular  in april we implemented a new management information system 
we believe this new system significantly affects many aspects of our business  including accounting  manufacturing operations  purchasing  sales and marketing functions 
the successful operation of this system is critical to our business 

table of contents competition for qualified personnel can be intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining personnel 
our future success will depend  to a significant extent  on the ability of our management to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
we are dependent on our ability to retain and motivate high caliber personnel  in addition to attracting new personnel 
in spite of the current worldwide economic slowdown  competition for qualified technical and other personnel can be intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
competitors and others have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees 
while our employees are required to sign standard agreements concerning confidentiality and ownership of inventions  we generally do not have employment contracts or non competition agreements with any of our personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers and other technical personnel  could negatively affect our business 
we are liable for c cube s pre merger tax liabilities  including tax liabilities resulting from the spin off of its semiconductor business 
the spin off of c cube s semiconductor business gave rise to a significant tax liability of approximately million based on a valuation of the semiconductor business of billion 
the estimated liability was paid in by harmonic 
under state law  harmonic generally is liable for all of c cube s debts  including c cube s liability for taxes resulting from the spin off and other pre merger tax liabilities 
c cube retained and transferred to harmonic in the merger an amount of cash and other consideration sufficient to pay this liability as well as all other tax liabilities of c cube and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the merger 
approximately million of pre merger tax liabilities remain outstanding and are included in accrued liabilities 
harmonic expects final settlement and payment of these obligations during  to a variety of taxing authorities and lsi logic  which acquired the spun off semiconductor business in june and assumed its obligations 
to the extent that these obligations are finally settled for less than the amounts provided  harmonic is required  under the terms of the merger agreement  to refund the difference to lsi logic 
the merger agreement stipulates that harmonic will be indemnified by the spun off semiconductor business if the cash reserves are not sufficient to satisfy all of c cube s tax liabilities for periods prior to the merger 
if for any reason  the spun off semiconductor business does not have sufficient cash to pay such taxes  or if there are additional taxes due with respect to the non semiconductor business and harmonic cannot be indemnified by c cube  harmonic generally will remain liable  and such liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
we may be subject to risks associated with other acquisitions 
we have made and may make investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
if we make acquisitions  we could have difficulty assimilating or retaining the acquired companies key personnel and operations or integrating the acquired technology or products into ours 
we also may face challenges in achieving the strategic objectives  cost savings or other benefits from a proposed acquisition and difficulties in expanding our management information systems to accommodate the acquired business 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and significantly increase our expenses 
moreover  our operating results may suffer because of acquisition related expenses  amortization of intangible assets and impairment of acquired goodwill or intangible assets 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions  or to provide for additional working capital requirements  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks  our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed 
cessation of the development and production of video encoding chips by c cube s spun off semiconductor business may adversely impact us 
the divicom business and c cube semiconductor business collaborated on the production and development of two video encoding microelectronic chips prior to the merger 
in connection with the merger  harmonic and the spun off semiconductor business entered into a contractual relationship under which harmonic will have access to certain of the spun off semiconductor business technologies and products which the divicom business previously depended for its product and service offerings 
the spun off semiconductor business is the sole supplier of these chips to harmonic 
several of these products continue to be important to our business  and we have incorporated these chips into additional products that we have developed 

table of contents however  under the contractual relationships between harmonic and the spun off semiconductor business  which was acquired by lsi logic in june  the semiconductor business does not have a firm commitment to continue the development of video encoding microelectronic chips 
as a result  the semiconductor business may choose not to continue future development of the chips for any reason 
the semiconductor business may also encounter in the future technological difficulties in the production and development of the chips 
if the spun off semiconductor business is not able to or does not sustain its development and production efforts in this area our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be harmed 
also  this agreement expires in see supply  license and development agreement at page of the joint proxy statement filed with the sec on march   for further details of harmonic s business relationship with the spun off semiconductor business after the merger 
we purchase several key components  subassemblies and modules used in the manufacture or integration of our products from sole or limited sources  and we are increasingly dependent on contract manufacturers 
many components  subassemblies and modules necessary for the manufacture or integration of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
our reliance on sole or limited suppliers  particularly foreign suppliers  and our increased reliance on subcontractors since the merger with c cube involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  subassemblies or modules and reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery of components  subassemblies or modules 
in particular  certain optical components have in the past been in short supply and are available only from a small number of suppliers  including sole source suppliers 
while we expend considerable efforts to qualify additional optical component sources  consolidation of suppliers in the industry and the small number of viable alternatives have limited the results of these efforts 
we do not generally maintain long term agreements with any of our suppliers or subcontractors 
an inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply could affect our ability to ship our products on a timely basis  which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our business 
we attempt to limit this risk by maintaining safety stocks of these components  subassemblies and modules 
as a result of this investment in inventories  we have in the past and in the future may be subject to risk of excess and obsolete inventories  which could harm our business  operating results  financial position and liquidity 
in this regard  our gross margins and operating results from the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of were adversely affected by excess and obsolete inventory charges of approximately million 
our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights may adversely affect us 
we currently hold issued united states patents and issued foreign patents  and have a number of patent applications pending 
although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  copyrights  licensing arrangements  maintaining certain technology as trade secrets and other measures  we cannot assure you that any patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property rights owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that such intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
we cannot assure you that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents that we own 
in addition  effective patent  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries in which we do business or may do business in the future 
we believe that the future success of our business will depend on our ability to translate the technological expertise and innovation of our personnel into new and enhanced products 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  vendors and customers as needed  and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology 
in addition  we have taken in the past  and may take in the future  legal action to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business  operating results  financial position and liquidity 
in order to successfully develop and market certain of our planned products for digital applications  we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties 
although many companies are often willing to enter into technology development or licensing agreements  we cannot assure you that such agreements will be negotiated on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the failure to enter into technology development or licensing agreements  when necessary  could limit our ability to develop and market new products and could cause our business to suffer 

table of contents we or our customers may face intellectual property infringement claims from third parties 
harmonic s industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  leading companies in the telecommunications industry have extensive patent portfolios 
from time to time  third parties  including these leading companies  have asserted and may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights against us or our customers 
indeed  a number of third parties  including leading companies  have asserted patent rights to technologies that are important to us 
our suppliers and customers may receive similar claims 
we have agreed to indemnify some of our suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement 
the scope of this indemnity varies  but  in some instances  includes indemnification for damages and expenses including reasonable attorney s fees 
in this regard  since december  we have been in communication with several of harmonic s customers who have been contacted by one of these leading companies that believes certain of our products require a license under a number of their patents 
we currently are reviewing the identified patents to examine whether we consider a license necessary 
while it is our understanding that the third party is willing to grant our customers a non exclusive license under the identified patents  there can be no assurance that the terms of any offered license would be acceptable to our customers or that failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license would not cause our operating results to be materially adversely affected 
we are the subject of securities class action claims and other litigation which  if adversely determined  could harm our business and operating results 
between june and august   several actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws by harmonic and certain of its officers and directors some of whom are no longer with harmonic were filed in or removed to the united states district court for the northern district of california 
the actions subsequently were consolidated 
a consolidated complaint  filed on december   was brought on behalf of a purported class of persons who purchased harmonic s publicly traded securities between january and june  the complaint also alleged claims on behalf of a purported subclass of persons who purchased c cube securities between january and may  in addition to harmonic and certain of its officers and directors  the complaint also named c cube microsystems inc and several of its officers and directors as defendants 
the complaint alleged that  by making false or misleading statements regarding harmonic s prospects and customers and its acquisition of c cube  certain defendants violated sections b and a of the securities exchange act of the complaint also alleged that certain defendants violated section a of the exchange act and sections  a  and of the securities act of by filing a false or misleading registration statement  prospectus  and joint proxy in connection with the c cube acquisition 
on july   the court dismissed the consolidated complaint with leave to amend 
an amended complaint alleging the same claims against the same defendants was filed on august  defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on september  on november   the court issued an opinion granting the motions to dismiss the amended complaint without leave to amend 
judgment for defendants was entered on december  on december   plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the judgment and for leave to file an amended complaint pursuant to rules e and a of the federal rules of civil procedure 
although a hearing on that motion was set for february   the court issued an order stating that it would decide the motion without a hearing 
the parties are awaiting the court s decision 
a derivative action purporting to be on behalf of harmonic was filed against its then current directors in the superior court for the county of santa clara on september  harmonic also was named as a nominal defendant 
the complaint is based on allegations similar to those found in the securities class actions and claims that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by  among other things  causing harmonic to violate federal securities laws 
the derivative action was removed to the united states district court for the northern district of california on september  all deadlines in this action have been stayed pending resolution of the motions to dismiss the securities actions

some anti takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan  as well as provisions of delaware law  could impair a takeover attempt 
harmonic has provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws  each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by the harmonic board of directors 
these include provisions authorizing blank check preferred stock  which could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to harmonic common stock  limiting the liability of  and providing indemnification to  directors and officers  limiting the ability of harmonic stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings  requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of harmonic stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to the harmonic board of directors  controlling the procedures for conduct and scheduling of board and stockholder meetings  and providing the board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings 
these provisions  alone or together  could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control or management of harmonic 
in addition  harmonic has adopted a stockholder rights plan 
the rights are not intended to prevent a takeover of harmonic  and we believe these rights will help harmonic s negotiations with any potential acquirors 
however  if the board of directors believes that a particular acquisition is undesirable  the rights may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging that acquisition 
the rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire harmonic on terms or in a manner not approved by the harmonic board of directors  except pursuant to an offer conditioned upon redemption of the rights

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  our stockholder rights plan or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for harmonic stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of harmonic common stock  and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for harmonic common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the operating results  financial position  or liquidity of harmonic due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
harmonic is exposed to market risk because of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and currencies of harmonic s subsidiaries 
foreign currency exchange risk harmonic has a number of international subsidiaries each of whose sales are generally denominated in us dollars 
following implementation of the euro in january  a higher proportion of our european business is denominated in euros which may subject us to increased foreign currency exchange risk 
in addition  the company has various international branch offices which provide sales support and systems integration services 
while harmonic does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity  harmonic cannot assure you that a sudden and significant change in the value of local currencies would not harm harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to harmonic s investment portfolio of marketable debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities and to harmonic s borrowings under its bank line of credit facility 
harmonic does not use derivative instruments in its investment portfolio  and its investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of less than two years 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at estimated fair value  with material unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income 
there is risk that losses could be incurred if harmonic were to sell any of its securities prior to stated maturity 
a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on financial conditions  results of operations and cash flows
