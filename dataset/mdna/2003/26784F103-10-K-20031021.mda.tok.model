item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the company s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
statements regarding future economic performance  management s plans and objectives  and any statements concerning its assumptions related to the foregoing contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations constitute forward looking statements 
certain factors  which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward looking statements  accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this report  including without limitation  the factors disclosed under risk factors 
general sales consist primarily of charges to customers for delivery services and weekly or monthly charges for recurring services  such as facilities management 
sales are recognized when the service is performed 
the yield value per transaction for a particular service is dependent upon a number of factors including size and weight of articles transported  distance transported  special handling requirements  requested delivery time and local market conditions 
generally  articles of greater weight transported over longer distances and those that require special handling produce higher yields 
cost of sales consists of costs relating directly to performance of services  including driver and messenger costs  third party delivery charges  insurance and worker s compensation costs 
substantially all of the drivers used by the company own their own vehicles  and approximately of these owner operators are independent contractors as opposed to employees of the company 
drivers and messengers are generally compensated based on a percentage of the delivery charge 
consequently  the company s driver and messenger costs are variable in nature 
to the extent that the drivers and messengers are employees of the company  employee benefit costs related to them  such as payroll taxes and insurance  are also included in cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs incurred at the branch level related to taking orders and dispatching drivers and messengers  as well as administrative costs related to such functions 
also included in selling  general and administrative expenses are regional and corporate level marketing and administrative costs and occupancy costs related to branch and corporate locations 
generally  the company s on demand services provide higher gross profit margins than do scheduled distribution or fleet management services because driver compensation for on demand services is generally lower as a percentage of sales from such services 
however  scheduled distribution and fleet management services generally have fewer administrative requirements related to order taking  dispatching drivers and billing 
as a result of these variances  the company s margins are dependent in part on the mix of business for a particular period 
as the company has no significant investment in transportation equipment  depreciation and amortization expense primarily relates to depreciation of office  communication and computer equipment  and software and the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the company s various acquisitions  each of which has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
effective august  the company adopted sfas no which requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill 
amortization of goodwill totaled million in the year ended july  a significant portion of the company s sales is generated in canada 
for the fiscal years ended july   and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s sales were generated in canada 
before deduction of corporate costs  the majority of which are incurred in the us  the cost structure of the company s operations in the us and in canada is similar 
the conversion rate of canadian dollars to us dollars increased during the fiscal year ending july  compared to july  and decreased during the fiscal year ending july  compared to july  as the canadian dollar is the functional currency for the company s canadian operations  these changes in the exchange rate have affected the company s reported sales 
the effect of these changes on the company s net income loss for the fiscal years ended july   and has not been significant  although there can be no assurance that fluctuations in such currency exchange rate will not  in the future  have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company believes that the following are its most significant accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from such estimates 
the company reviews all significant estimates affecting the financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their issuance 
intangibles intangibles arise from acquisitions accounted for as purchased business combinations and include goodwill  covenants not to compete and other identifiable intangibles and from the payment of financing costs associated with the company s credit facility 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over all tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired 
effective august  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that the company identify reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
the company s operations are conducted in two geographic regions  canada and the united states 
these two regions were identified as reporting units in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
because discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of these regions 
management performed a valuation on each of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow model 
this model indicated a valuation that was far in excess of the company s market capitalization  however  management did not believe this could be used as the sole indicator of fair value 
accordingly  the company engaged an independent business valuation firm to perform a valuation of these reporting units 
the independent firm utilized a methodology combining the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach is based on the present value of future economic benefits that accrue to the shareholders 
the market approach establishes value through the analysis of the market price of the common stock of comparable  publicly traded companies 
the independent firms conclusion of the value of dynamex was derived by applying a weight of to the value determined under the income approach and to the value determined under the market approach 
using this valuation as the purchase price in a purchase price allocation model  the implied value of the goodwill for the united states segment was approximately million  compared to a carrying value of approximately million 
as a result  the company recognized a goodwill impairment loss related to this segment of million 
although the performance of the united states operations has improved  the large amount of goodwill recorded during the competitive acquisition environment of the late s was not fully supported by the valuation model 
the implied value of the goodwill for the company s canadian operations was in excess of million compared to a carrying value of approximately million 
the company completed its goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded the million charge net of million of deferred tax benefits as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations 
as required by sfas no 
 the charge was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal based on this test  the fair value of the goodwill exceeds the carrying amount 
other intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from to years 
self insured claims liability 
the company is financially self insured for us workers compensation claims 
a liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but unreported losses  are recorded based on the company s estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred 
the company s estimates are based on actual experience and historical assumptions of development of unpaid liabilities over time 
factors affecting the determination of amounts to be accrued for workers compensation claims include  but are not limited to  cost  frequency  or payment patterns resulting from new types of claims  the hazard level of our operations  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions  court interpretations  changes in the medical conditions of claimants and economic factors such as inflation 
the method of calculating the estimated accrued liability for workers compensation claims is subject to inherent uncertainty 
if actual results are less favorable than what are used to calculate the accrued liability  the company would have to record expenses in excess of what has already been accrued 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make payments when due or within a reasonable period of time thereafter 
estimates are used in determining this allowance based on the company s historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of accounts receivable by aging category 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required 
in fiscal  the company deployed additional resources to manage accounts receivable and collection activities resulting in reduced time to collect the receivables and lower bad debt expense 
these improvements led to lower allowances for doubtful accounts in the years ending july  and the company has increased the allowance at july  to approximately of outstanding accounts receivable  compared to of outstanding receivables at july   due primarily to the financial condition of a single customer 
income taxes income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting 
the net deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
as of july   the company has available federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income of million 
in addition  the company has generated unused foreign tax credits related to its canadian operations and other tax credits of million 
the company continuously reviews the probability of realization of deferred tax assets and has established valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized 
as of july   the company has established valuation allowances totaling million in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes sfas no 
for us operating losses and other tax credits not currently deductible 
prior to the fiscal year  the company had a history of taxable net operating losses in the united states 
in the year ended july   the company generated us taxable income of approximately million  including million of dividend income from the company s canadian subsidiary 
based on such a limited period and the relatively small amount from operations  management does not believe that this is sufficient evidence to support a determination that it is more likely than not that the remaining tax benefits available from us operating losses will be realized 
however  should this trend of taxable income continue  it may become necessary  as early as fiscal  to release a portion or all of the valuation allowance 
stock based compensation statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
encourages but does not require companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company elected to continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations during the fiscal years ending on or before july  accordingly  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company s stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements effective august   the company elected to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
for stock based employee compensation 
under the modified prospective method of adoption selected by the company  stock based employee compensation cost recognized in will be the same as that which would have been recognized had the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
been applied to all awards granted after august  based on the outstanding and unvested awards as of april   the anticipated effect on net income for fiscal  net of taxes  will be approximately foreign currency translation assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the year 
the net exchange differences resulting from these translations are recorded in stockholders equity 
where amounts denominated in a foreign currency are converted into u 
s 
dollars by remittance or repayment  the realized exchange differences are included as other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items from the company s consolidated statement of operations  expressed as a percentage of sales 
due to the adoption of sfas no 
 there was no goodwill amortization during each of the years ended july  and during the year ended july   the company recorded million in goodwill amortization 
years ended july  sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization recovery of settlement of shareholder litigation gain loss on sale of property and equipment operating income interest expense other income expense income before income taxes income taxes income before accounting change year ended july  compared to year ended july  net income for the year ended july  was million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended july  the net loss for includes a non cash after tax adjustment of million to adjust the carrying value of goodwill to fair value in accordance with sfas no 
the following discussion and analysis excludes the goodwill impairment 
sales for the year ended july  were million compared to million in  an increase of approximately 
the company s investment in a us national sales organization beginning in january began to show a return on this investment in the current fiscal year  as evidenced by new contracts signed with several large national accounts 
local and national accounts teams are focused on demonstrating the value of our comprehensive menu of services  and during a soft economy clients are drawn to the benefits of our scheduled  distribution and outsourcing services 
sales of these services increased million  or over last year  while on demand sales grew  or million 
these increases result in part from increased sales volume  and in part from the increase in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollar 
the canadian dollar was stronger compared to the us dollar in fiscal  which had the effect of increasing reported sales by approximately million 
cost of sales increased million to million in compared to million in the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales increased from in to in this increase in cost as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to higher insurance costs and bad debt expense and a change in the overall business mix of the company s sales 
scheduled  distribution and outsourcing sales were a larger percentage of total sales  increasing from in the prior year  to in historically on demand sales have lower cost of sales and higher selling  general and administrative costs sg a compared to scheduled  distribution and outsourcing sales 
sg a costs were million for the year ended july  compared to million for the fiscal year ended july  the increase from to is attributable to a number of factors 
the increase in the exchange rate between the canadian dollar and the us dollar had the effect of increasing reported sg a costs by approximately million 
compensation and employee benefits costs were million more than in approximately one third of the increase is due to the change in the exchange rate between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
the remaining increase is due principally to higher compensation and benefits associated with the lifting of the salary freeze earlier this fiscal year  additional operating personnel to handle new business  higher sales commissions related to new business  additional sales personnel and higher unemployment taxes and medical insurance premiums 
the increase in compensation and employee benefits was partially offset by reductions in communications costs million and legal and professional fees million 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses decreased from in to in depreciation and amortization was million in compared to million in the prior year 
this decrease is due to lower capital expenditures in recent years 
the company purchased enterprise software several years ago  which was fully amortized at the end of in  the decision was made to transition to two way mobile data units to communicate with drivers  which requires no initial capital expenditure 
interest expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to this decrease is due to a lower level of debt in and lower interest rates compared to the prior year 
other income of million in consists primarily of realized foreign currency transaction gains of million and interest income of million 
in the prior year  a foreign currency transaction loss of million related to the canadian tax restructuring was offset by interest income totaling million 
the effective tax rate was in compared to in taxable income in the us was offset by the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards nols generated in prior years 
the deferred tax asset resulting from these nols has been fully reserved for financial reporting purposes  therefore there was no tax expense reported related to this income 
in march  the company s canadian subsidiary paid a million dividend to the us the payment of this dividend resulted in a foreign tax credit of million  which reduced tax expense in the us in addition  the canadian statutory federal tax rate decreased marginally in the effective rate in was high due to a million non recurring tax expense and a million foreign exchange loss not deductible for tax purposes related to the tax reorganization of the company s canadian operations 
year ended july  compared to year ended july  the net loss for the year ended july  was million compared to net income of million for the year ended july  the net loss for includes a non cash after tax adjustment of million to adjust the carrying value of goodwill to fair market value in accordance with sfas no 
as well as one time charges totaling million associated with the tax reorganization of our canadian operations 
net income for includes other income of approximately million related to the settlement of claims related to the shareholder class action lawsuit and gains on sales of surplus radio licenses of million 
the following discussion and analysis excludes the aforementioned goodwill impairment  non recurring and unusual charges and adjustments 
sales for the year ended july  were million compared to million in  a decline of approximately 
the decline is attributable to a number of factors 
first  the economic slowdown in the us and canada that began during the second half of fiscal continued and had a negative impact on sales in  primarily on demand services 
second  the decline in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollar had the effect of reducing sales by slightly over million had the exchange rate been the same as the prior year 
third  the phase out of a contract with a single customer negatively impacted sales by approximately million during  and sales growth for the fiscal year will be negatively impacted by approximately million of sales to this customer 
while the company is disappointed in the loss of this contract  a large portion of the services provided is not part of the company s core competencies 
cost of sales decreased million to million in compared to million in the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales increased from in to in this increase in cost is primarily attributable to a change in the overall business mix of the company 
on demand sales were approximately of total sales in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year scheduled and distribution and other specialized service sales increased as a percentage of total sales while on demand sales have declined both as percentage of sales and in absolute dollars 
historically on demand sales have lower cost of sales and higher selling  general and administrative costs compared to scheduled and distribution and other specialized service sales 
as a result of this change in business mix  cost of sales has increased as a percentage of sales while selling  general and administrative sg a costs have declined as a percentage of sales 
sg a costs were million for the fiscal year ended july  compared to million for the year ended july  as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses decreased from in to in the decline from to is attributable to a number of factors 
compensation and employee benefits declined million as a result of the change in the business mix that requires fewer personnel in the dispatch and customer service areas  as well as lower administrative salaries due to fewer personnel 
through on going cost reduction initiatives  the company has eliminated approximately million of non essential employee related costs including travel and entertainment  as well as reductions of over  of communication  occupancy and other office costs 
depreciation and amortization was million in compared to million in the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the adoption of sfas no 
million  which requires that companies no longer amortize goodwill  and the reduction in amortization of covenants not to compete that are fully amortized after three years million 
most of the company s acquisitions occurred in fiscal years through  therefore  all covenants were fully amortized in fiscal and prior years 
interest expense decreased million or in the fiscal year ended july  compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a lower level of debt in and lower interest rates compared to the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal years ended july   and  the company s used capital primarily for capital expenditures  working capital needs and debt reduction 
as of july   the company s bank credit agreement consisted of an amortizing term loan of million and a revolving credit facility of million due november  this third amendment to the third amended and restated credit agreement credit facility was executed may  the amount available under the revolving credit facility is based on a formula  generally defined as of accounts receivable less than days past due 
required principal payments on the amortizing term loan consist of million quarterly  with a final payment of  due on november  interest on outstanding borrowings is payable monthly at prime plus a margin ranging from to  or libor plus a margin ranging from to  based on the ratio of total debt to ebitda  as defined in the agreement 
at july   the company s total debt to ebitda ratio was to  therefore the applicable margin is for prime based loans and for libor based loans  effective august  in addition  the company is required to pay a commitment fee for any unused amounts of the revolving credit facility  ranging from to per annum based on the ratio of total debt to ebitda 
this fee is currently 
as of july  borrowings under the credit facility totaled approximately  and the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling  amounts outstanding under the credit facility are secured by all of the company s us assets and of the stock of the company s principal canadian subsidiaries 
the agreement contains restrictions on the payment of dividends  incurring additional debt  capital expenditures and investments by the company 
in addition  the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios related to minimum amounts of stockholders equity  fixed charges to cash flow and funded debt to cash flow  and to reduce the amortizing term loan principal at the end of each year beginning july   by the amount of excess cash flow  all as defined in the agreement 
since the company s total debt to ebitda was less than to at july   the restriction on the payment of dividends and the requirement to reduce the amortizing term loan by the amount of excess cash flow were waived 
the agreement also requires the company to obtain the consent of the lender for additional acquisitions in certain instances 
effective july   the company entered into an interest rate protection arrangement on the amortizing term loan portion of the credit facility 
the interest rate has been fixed at the libor margin plus at july  
this arrangement matures november  at july   unpaid settlements related to the interest rate swap were not material 
the fair value of the company s interest rate protection arrangements at july  was an asset of  and at july  was a liability of  at july  the weighted average interest rate for all outstanding borrowings was approximately 
during the fiscal years ended july   and  the company spent approximately million  million and million respectively  on capital expenditures  which expenditures primarily related to improvements in infrastructure and technology to support the company s operations 
management expects the amount of capital expenditures for these purposes in future years to range between million and million 
the company does not have significant capital expenditure requirements to replace or expand the number of vehicles used in its operations because substantially all of its drivers are owner operators who provide their own vehicles 
the company s cash flow provided by operations for the fiscal years ended july   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
this internally generated cash flow financed entirely the company s increases in working capital and purchases of property and equipment 
changes in working capital provided million and million of operating cash flow in fiscal and  respectively  compared to a use of operating cash flow totaling million in the year ended july  management expects internally generated cash flow will be sufficient to support its future capital requirements 
the company s access to other sources of capital  such as additional bank borrowings and the issuance of debt securities  is affected by  among other things  general market conditions affecting the availability of such capital 
the company completed its last acquisition in august and there currently are no pending or contemplated acquisitions 
the company s ability to make future acquisitions is dependent upon many factors  including the availability of capital  and currently requires approval by the company s primary lenders 
there can be no assurance that such capital will be available or that it can be obtained on terms the company deems acceptable  or that the company will be able to obtain the lender s consent 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth the company s contractual commitments as of july  for the periods indicated in thousands less than total year years years thereafter long term debt    operating leases      total      the company has entered into an employment agreement with its ceo which provides for the payment of a base salary in the annual amount of  participation in an executive bonus plan  an auto allowance  and participation in other employee benefit plans 
in addition  the company has entered into retention agreements with certain key executive officers and other employees that provide certain benefits in the event their employment is terminated subsequent to a change in control of the company  as defined in the retention agreements 
the company believes that it is unlikely that these circumstances will transpire  but if they did the potential exposure could range between million and million 
as of july  the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling  income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal  compared to million and million in the years ended july  and  respectively 
the difference between the statutory rates and the effective federal income tax rates is primarily attributable to foreign and state income taxes  changes in the valuation allowance on net operating loss carryforwards  and other expenses that are non deductible for tax purposes 
as of july   the company has available federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income of million 
in addition  the company has generated unused foreign tax credits related to its canadian operations and other tax credits of million

based on such a limited period and the relatively small amount of taxable income generated from operations  management does not believe that this is sufficient evidence to support a determination that it is more likely than not that the remaining tax benefits available from us operating losses will be realized 
however  should this trend of taxable income continue  it may become necessary  as early as fiscal  to release a portion or all of the valuation allowance 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the company s results of operations nor does it believe it will do so in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
financial condition the company believes its financial condition remains strong and that it has the financial resources necessary to meet its needs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign exchange exposure significant portions of the company s operations are conducted in canada 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us and canadian dollar result in fluctuations in the amounts relating to the canadian operations reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company historically has not entered into hedging transactions with respect to its foreign currency exposure  but may do so in the future 
the sensitivity analysis model used by the company for foreign exchange exposure compares the revenue and net income figures from canadian operations over the previous four quarters at the actual exchange rate versus a decrease in the exchange rate 
based on this model  a decrease would result in a decrease in revenue of approximately million and a decrease in net income of approximately million over this period 
there can be no assurances that the above projected exchange rate decrease will materialize 
fluctuations of exchange rates are beyond the control of the company s management 
interest rate exposure effective july   the company entered into an interest rate protection arrangement on the amortizing term loan portion of the credit facility 
the interest rate has been fixed at the libor margin plus at july  
this arrangement matures november  the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the sensitivity analysis model used by the company for interest rate exposure compares interest expense fluctuations over a one year period based on current debt levels and current interest rates versus current debt levels at current interest rates with a increase 
based on this model  a increase would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately  there can be no assurances that the above projected interest rate increase will materialize 
fluctuations of interest rates are beyond the control of the company s management
