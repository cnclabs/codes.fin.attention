the following discussion reflects the results of that restatement 
overview of during  dollar general increased its net sales by  primarily as a result of its continued rapid pace of new store openings 
from through  the company had a compounded annual net sales growth rate of 
same store sales increased in  as compared with increases of and in and  respectively 
same store sales increases are calculated based on the comparable calendar weeks in the prior year 
same store sales calculations include only those stores that were open both at the end of a fiscal year and at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year 
the year marked the fifteenth consecutive year that the company increased its total number of store units 
the company opened new stores in  compared with in and in  and remodeled or relocated stores  compared with in and in during the last three years  the company has opened  remodeled or relocated  stores  accounting for approximately of its total stores as of january  the company ended with  stores 
in  new stores  remodels and relocations  net of closed stores  added an aggregate of approximately million square feet of selling space to the company s total sales space 
as a result  the company had an aggregate of approximately million square feet of selling space at the end of the year 
the average new store opened in and had approximately  selling square feet 
virtually all of the new stores opened in are subject to traditional operating lease arrangements 
the company currently expects to open approximately new stores in within its existing market area  close to stores  and remodel or relocate approximately stores 
the new store openings in are expected to be divided evenly between small towns and more densely populated areas and generally will be within miles of existing distribution centers 
the company expects its new stores to be subject to traditional operating lease arrangements 
capital expenditures related to new store openings will be financed through a combination of cash flows from operations and existing credit facilities 
the company focused on the following key initiatives in standardizing work processes to improve the execution of basic retail tasks  completing the roll out of store perpetual inventories  executing an effective disposition program for certain excess inventory identified in the fourth quarter of  and implementing the arthur merchandise planning system to improve its merchandise planning process 
the company made substantial progress in on each of these initiatives 
the company launched the seven habits of a highly effective dollar general store  which is a program designed to improve store level execution in the areas of ordering  receiving  stocking  presentation  selling  support and staffing 
as of january   all of the company s stores are on a perpetual inventory system  which allows the company to track store level inventory at t he sku level 
during  the company liquidated all but approximately million at cost of the aforementioned excess inventory  and the company implemented the product and location planning  channel clustering  demand forecasting  and performance analysis modules of the arthur merchandise planning system 
critical accounting policies merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail last in  first out lifo method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
also  it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  initial markups  markdowns  and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted or inaccurate cost figures 
factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation of the inventory balance include applying the rim to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost and selling price relationship and turnover applying rim to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise inaccurate estimates of inventory shrinkage between the date of the last physical inventory at a store and the financial statement date inaccurate estimates of lifo reserves to reduce the potential of such distortions in the valuation of inventory from occurring  the company s rim utilizes departments in which fairly homogenous classes of merchandise inventories having similar gross margins are grouped 
the company estimates its shrink provision based on historical experience and utilizes an outside statistician to assist in the lifo sampling process and index formulation 
on a periodic basis  the company reviews and evaluates its inventory and records an adjustment  if necessary  to reflect its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
as previously discussed  the company collected sku level inventory information at each of its stores during in connection with its establishment of an item based perpetual inventory system 
in conjunction with this undertaking  in an effort to improve inventory valuation and cost of goods sold estimates  the company will be refining estimates of its retail ownership mix and expanding the number of departments it utilizes for its gross margin calculations 
the company has not established a date for these changes  which may result in an inventory adjustment and may also impact the rim calculation results in the year of adoption and in subsequent years 
the impact of such changes on the company s consolidated financial statements cannot currently be estimated 
the implementation of the item based perpetual inventory system in has improved our ability to identify items where we are carrying more inventory than our sales information would suggest is necessary 
the company intends to evaluate such information on an ongoing basis and take periodic markdowns to ensure the salability of our inventory 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are recorded at cost 
the company provides for depreciation on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
property and equipment are reviewed for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
self insurance liability 
the company retains a significant portion of the risk for its workers compensation  employee health insurance  general liability  property loss and automobile coverage 
these costs are significant primarily due to the large employee base and number of stores 
provisions are made to this insurance liability on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed by outside actuaries utilizing historical claim trends 
if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns  the company may be required to record additional expense or expense reductions which could be material to the company s results of operations 
results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial performance is based on the consolidated financial statements set forth herein 
net sales 
net sales totaled billion for  billion for and billion for  representing annual increases of in  in and in the increases resulted primarily from net new stores and a same store sales increase of in  net new stores and a same store sales increase of in  and net new stores and a same store sales increase of in the company tracks its sales internally by four major categories highly consumable  seasonal  home products and basic clothing 
total sales in the highly consumable category increased by  and in  and  respectively 
total sales in the seasonal category increased by  and in  and  respectively 
total sales in the home products category experienced annual changes of  and in  and  respectively 
total sales in the basic clothing category increased by  and in  and  respectively 
the company s same store sales increase of was due to a number of factors  including but not limited to the introduction of approximately new items in the highly consumable category  a strong performance of seasonal merchandise in the first half of due in part to the introduction of new outdoor items and the staging of warm weather items in our stores earlier than in prior years  an increase in the number of stores offering perishable products from at the end of to  at the end of  and improved ordering practices by our store employees 
the company attributes the same store sales increase that it achieved in to a number of factors  including but not limited to an improved in stock position  an increase in the number of stores offering perishable products from in to by the end of  strong sales of seasonal merchandise resulting in part from additional floor space dedicated to such items as part of the store reset program  described below  that was undertaken in  and expanded offerings in certain highly consumable categories including home cleaning  paper products and pet supplies 
the company believes that the lower same store sales increase in was due primarily to the disruptive effect of a comprehensive store reset program designed to improve the product mix and appearance of its stores  which affected the vast majority of the store base 
other factors that may have had an impact on the lower same store sales increase in include a change in store ordering procedures from a manual process to a new automated system relying on the scanning of shelf tags  which may have been an additional cause of the sporadic out of stock conditions experienced by the company during this period  and a general softening of economic conditions 
gross profit 
gross profit for was billion  or of sales  compared with billion  or of sales  in and billion  or of sales  in the slight decline in the gross profit rate in as compared with is due primarily to an increase in the company s shrinkage provision as further described below 
the company improved its initial margin on inventory purchases in all four of its major categories in as compared against however  the continued shift in the company s sales mix to lower margin highly consumable items limited the year over year increase in the total initial margin rate to basis points 
the company recorded an million adjustment and a million adjustment in the fourth quarters of and  respectively  pertaining to its lifo valuation  which had the effect of increasing gross profit in both years 
these adjustments are primarily the result of the company s ability to lower its product costs through effective purchasing methods and the general lack o f inflation in the current economic environment 
the improvement in the gross profit rate in as compared to was due primarily to the million effect of a markdown recorded in as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the markdown in resulted from the identification by the company of certain excess inventories that it believed would require a markdown to assist with their disposition by the conclusion of the company also improved its initial margin on inventory purchases by basis points in as compared against the company was able to make particular improvements in its inventory margin in the housewares  seasonal and mens and boys clothing product lines 
inventory shrinkage calculated at the retail value of the inventory  as a percentage of sales  was in  in  and in some of the actions taken by the company in to combat shrink include the hiring of an asset protection professional  the development of an asset protection monthly scorecard  the installation of loss prevention software that identifies unusual cash register transactions  increasing the emphasis of shrink in the store bonus plan and the establishment of a multi disciplinary shrink task force that has developed a comprehensive shrink reduction action plan 
some of the components of the action plan include increased use of closed circuit television monitors and burglar alarms  a specific high shrink store action plan  the creation of various shrink awareness tools and the production of various exception reports to identify high risk stores 
distribution and transportation costs decreased by basis points as a percentage of sales in as compared to the reduction in distribution and transportation costs as a percentage of sales was due primarily to freight  occupancy and depreciation expenses that grew at a rate less than the sales increase 
factors contributing to this result in include lower fuel costs during the first half of the year  an effective freight revenue sharing program whereby the company picks up product directly from its vendors as opposed to having it shipped  and the fact that distribution center occupancy costs are relatively fixed in comparison with the growth in our sales base 
distribution and transportation costs decreased by basis points as a percentage of sales in as compared to the reduction in distribution and transportation costs as a percentage of sales in was due primarily to a relatively modest increase in transportation costs during a period of increased sales 
factors contributing to this result in included the opening of the zanesville  ohio dc  which supported continued expansion in the number of stores with only a modest increase in store delivery miles  increased trailer utilization as a result of improved routing  and lower fuel costs

the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of sales  excluding restatement expenses  in was due to a number of factors including but not limited to increases in the following expense categories that were in excess of the percentage increase in sales store labor  workers compensation claims  store occupancy and store repairs and maintenance 
the basis point increase in sg a expense as a percentage of net sales experienced in was due in part to the million in restatement related expenses referred to above 
there were no such expenses in  and such expenses recorded in were in addition to the litigation settlement expense described below that was recorded in the increase in sg a expense in was also attributable in part to a increase in labor expenses at the company s retail stores  which was in excess of the company s sales increase of 
the increased labor expenses incurred in resulted from a decision by the company s management to spend additional funds in this area in order to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to improve store conditions

 accounting for variable interest entities fin  expands upon current guidance relating to when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of a variable interest entity 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply for older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   which would apply for the company beginning in the third quarter of the company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of fin will have on its financial position and results of operations when adopted in forward looking statements risk factors some of the statements in this form k and in the documents incorporated by reference into this form k are forward looking statements 
for example  some statements may express or imply projections of revenues or expenditures  statements of plans and objectives for future operations or statements of future economic performance 
also  the words believe  anticipate  project  plan  expect  estimate  objective  forecast  goal  intend  will likely result  or will continue and similar expressions generally identify forward looking statements 
these  and similar statements  are forward looking statements concerning matters that involve risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual performance of the company to differ mater ially from those expressed or implied by these statements 
all forward looking information should be evaluated in the context of these risks  uncertainties and other factors 
the company believes the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements are reasonable  however  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate  and therefore  actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the factors and risks that may result in actual results differing from such forward looking information include  but are not limited to the company s reputation and financial condition could be affected by the restatement and or the pending sec investigation 
as previously disclosed  the company announced on april  that it had become aware of certain accounting issues that would cause it to restate its audited financial statements for fiscal years and  and to restate the unaudited financial information for fiscal year that had been previously released by the company 
the company subsequently restated such financial statements and financial information by means of its form k for the fiscal year ended february   which was filed on january  the sec is conducting an investigation into the circumstances that gave rise to the company s april  announcement 
the company is cooperating with this investigation by providing documents  testimony and other information to the sec 
at this time  the company is unable to predict the outcome of this investigation and the ultimate effects on the company  if any 
in addition  the publicity surrounding the sec investigation could affect the company s reputation and have an impact on its financial condition 
the company s business is modestly seasonal with the highest sales occurring during the fourth quarter 
adverse events during the fourth quarter could  therefore  affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company realizes a larger portion of its net sales and net income during the christmas selling season 
in anticipation of the holidays  the company purchases substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hires many temporary employees 
if for any reason the company s net sales during the christmas selling season were to fall below seasonal norms  a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result 
if such an imbalance were to occur  markdowns might be required to minimize this imbalance 
the company s profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unbudgeted markdowns 
adverse weather conditions or other disruptions  especially during the peak christmas season  could also adversely affect the company s net sales and could make it more difficult for the company to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from its suppliers 
competition in the retail industry could limit the company s growth opportunities and reduce its profitability 
the company competes in the discount retail merchandise business  which is highly competitive 
this competitive environment subjects the company to the risk of reduced profitability resulting from reduced margins required to maintain the company s competitive position 
the company competes with discount stores and with many other retailers  including mass merchandise  grocery  drug  convenience  variety and other specialty stores 
some of the nation s largest retail companies operate stores in areas where the company operates 
the company s direct competitors in the dollar store retail category include family dollar  dollar tree  fred s  and various local  independent operators 
competitors from other retail categories in clude cvs  rite aid  walgreens  eckerd  wal mart and kmart 
the discount retail merchandise business is subject to excess capacity and some of the company s competitors are much larger and have substantially greater resources than the company 
the competition for customers has intensified in recent years as larger competitors  such as wal mart  have moved into the company s geographic markets 
the company remains vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of these major national discount chains  and to the risk that these chains or others could venture into the dollar store industry in a significant way 
generally  the company expects an increase in competition 
the company s financial performance is sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that may impact consumer spending 
a general slowdown in the united states economy may adversely affect the spending of the company s consumers  which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis 
future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment levels  business conditions  fuel and energy costs  interest rates  and tax rates  could also adversely affect the company s business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to other products 
possibility of war  acts of terrorism and rising fuel costs could adversely impact the company 
the involvement of the united states in a war in the middle east or elsewhere or a significant act of terrorism on us soil or elsewhere could have an adverse impact on the company by  among other things  disrupting its information or distribution systems  causing dramatic increases in fuel prices thereby increasing the costs of doing business  or impeding the flow of imports or domestic products to the company 
the company s business is dependent on its vendors 
the company believes that it has generally good relations with its vendors and that it is generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors 
if the company fails to maintain good relations with its vendors  it may not be able to obtain attractive pricing with the consequence that its net sales or profit margins would be reduced 
the company may also face difficulty in obtaining needed inventory from its vendors because of interruptions in production or for other reasons  which would adversely affect the company s business 
the efficient operation of the company s business is heavily dependent on its information systems 
the company depends on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its business 
the company relies on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support the company s business 
the software programs supporting many of the company s systems were licensed to the company by independent software developers 
the inability of these developers or the company to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the company s operations if it were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner 
in addition  costs and potential problems and interruptions associa ted with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the company s operations 
the company is subject to interest rate risk 
the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing  investing and cash management activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management the company is exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates 
to minimize such risk  the company may periodically use financial instruments  including derivatives 
as a matter of policy  the company does not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and all financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to board of directors approval 
all financial instrument positions taken by the company are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of high correlation between the financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure 
the financial instruments used by the company are straightforward instruments with liqu id markets 
the company has cash flow exposure relating to variable interest rates associated with its revolving line of credit  and may periodically seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate derivatives 
the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate obligations is based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
at january  and february   the fair value of the company s debt  excluding capital lease obligations  was estimated at approximately million and million  respectively  based on the estimated market value of the debt at those dates 
such fair value is less than the carrying value of the debt at january  and february   by approximately million and million  respectively 
at february   the company was party to an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million

under the terms of the agreement  the company paid a fixed rate of and received a floating rate libor on the million notional amount through september  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was million at february  the counterparty to the company s interest rate swap agreement was a major financial institution 
the interest rate swap agreement expired on september  and  as of january   the company was not party to any interest rate derivatives 
in and  as required by sfas no 
 the company recorded the fair value of the interest rate swap in the balance sheet  with the offsetting  effective portion of the change in fair value recorded in other comprehensive loss  a separate component of shareholders equity in the consolidated financial statements 
amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss were reclassified into earnings  as an adjustment to interest expense  in the same period during which the hedged synthetic lease agreements affected earnings 
in fiscal  as required by the accounting literature for derivatives and hedging instruments in effect at that time  the company recognized any differences paid or received on interest rate swap agreements as adjustments to interest expense 
based upon the company s variable rate borrowing levels  a change in interest rates would have resulted in a pre tax loss in earnings and cash flows of approximately million and million  including the effects of interest rate swaps  in and  respectively 
in  the company does not anticipate the potential loss due to a change in interest rates to vary materially from the estimated impact in
