item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
all statements in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical are forward looking statements 
actual results may differ from the forward looking statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties that are discussed under risk factors in item and elsewhere on this annual report on form k 
shareholders and prospective investors in the company should carefully consider these risk factors 
we disclaim any obligation to update these statements for subsequent events 
genelabs technologies  inc  referred to as genelabs or the company  is a biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery and development of novel pharmaceutical products to improve human health 
genelabs is pursuing regulatory approval of prestara  its investigational drug for women with systemic lupus erythematosus  a disease for which no new drug has been approved in the past years and for which current therapies are not adequate 
we are also pursuing the discovery of novel antimicrobial and antiviral compounds for treatment of infections that are not well treated with currently available drugs 
we believe that these high risk  potentially high reward programs focus our research and development expertise in areas where we have the opportunity to be scientific pioneers and  if successful  we believe that these programs will yield products that will address diseases for which current therapies are inadequate 
at the same time  our established capabilities can be utilized as we diversify our research and development programs 
we have built drug discovery and clinical development capabilities that can support various research and development projects 
we are concentrating our capabilities on three core programs o developing our late stage product for lupus  prestara tm  o discovering follow on compounds to our preclinical antifungal drug candidate  and o discovering novel lead compounds that selectively inhibit replication of the hepatitis c virus  or hcv 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the following are critical accounting policies where estimates have been made which are important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations as presented in the financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees where we continue involvement through a collaboration or other obligation is recognized ratably over the development period 
deferred revenue at december  and at december   is from a single source  an up front payment received in from watson pharmaceuticals  inc  referred to as watson  for our license to them of the north american marketing rights to prestara 
genelabs management considers the amortization period for the up front payment from watson a critical accounting estimate 
the amortization period we use is based on our current estimate of the period we have significant obligations to watson 
in august  the fda issued an approvable letter to genelabs for prestara  citing issues to be addressed prior to approval  including  among other things  the successful completion of an additional clinical trial to confirm the positive effect of prestara on bone mineral density previously observed in women with mild to moderate lupus while on low dose glucocorticoids 
genelabs management believes that its significant obligations under the agreement with watson extend to the submission of a complete response to the approvable letter to the fda and the fda reaching a final decision regarding approval of the nda 
the date upon which we may receive a final fda decision on approval will vary based on  among other things  the time period necessary for the enrollment of a sufficient number of patients in the clinical trial  the results of the trial  and the length of time the fda will take to review the data submitted after the conclusion of the trial 
we do not directly control these time frames 
based on management s estimates  genelabs currently believes it could take until december for an fda decision on the nda 
accordingly  during  beginning in the third quarter  genelabs extended the amortization period of the up front payment received from watson from a period ending march  to a period ending december  the estimated period for amortization has a noteworthy impact on the revenue recognized  and  in turn  the net loss reported in genelabs financial statements 
for example  if a longer term were estimated genelabs revenue would be lower and the net loss would be higher 
conversely  if a shorter amortization term were estimated  genelabs revenue would be greater and the net loss lower 
we have assessed the remaining term over which the up front payment from watson is being recognized into the statement of operations  and believe it is the most appropriate term based on the facts known to us as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k 
however  actions taken by the fda  or other changes in circumstances  after the filing of this annual report on form k may either reduce or lengthen the remaining period over which genelabs records the up front revenue from watson 
discontinued operations 
we account for our diagnostics subsidiary  genelabs diagnostics pte 
ltd  referred to as gld  as a discontinued operation because we plan to sell this business 
accounting treatment for discontinued operations involves segregation of the net assets and operating results of the discontinued operation for separate disclosure in the financial statements  rather than including the results within the other line items of the financial statements 
we have accounted for gld as a discontinued operation since  the year we adopted a plan to divest gld 
we have determined that gld meets held for sale criteria of current accounting requirements as of december   and that discontinued operation accounting continues to apply 
judgments and estimates were used in reaching this conclusion 
a different interpretation of current accounting literature that concluded discontinued operation accounting did not apply would have a significant impact on the financial statements  increasing revenues  operating expenses  assets and liabilities  although shareholder s equity and the net loss would remain the same 
results of operations years ended december  and introduction 
genelabs net loss was million in  an increase of million from the million net loss in this increase is primarily the result of lower contract revenue and interest income in a more detailed discussion of the changes in genelabs statement of operations follows 
contract revenue 
contract revenues were million in  a decrease of million from million in contract revenues in in  approximately of revenue  or million  was the recognition into income of a previously received up front license payment from watson 
in  this source of revenue decreased by million from the million recorded as revenue from watson in due to the fda s clarification in the august approvable letter of the period over which we have significant obligation to watson 
based on management s estimates  genelabs currently believes it could take until december for an fda decision on the nda 
accordingly  during  beginning in the third quarter  genelabs extended the amortization period of the up front payment received from watson from a period ending march  to a period ending december  this change reduced revenue by million  as it was implemented beginning in the third quarter 
applied over a full year  it would reduce annual revenue by approximately million  but does not impact the cash flow of genelabs 
aside from the revenue recognized from watson  none of our other sources of revenue for exceeded million 
other sources of revenue include data analysis services performed for larger pharmaceutical companies  royalties and grants 
collectively  these other sources declined by million in compared to one component of this decrease was the scheduled expiration of genelabs defense advanced research projects agency darpa grant at the end of january  resulting in a decrease in contract revenue of million in compared to in addition  revenues from data analysis services performed for pharmaceutical companies also decreased by million 
partially offsetting these decreases  in genelabs recognized million in revenue from the license of dna amplification technologies to a leading genetic analysis tool company 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million in  an increase of million from the million in operating expenses in all operating expenses are related to genelabs business of discovering and developing pharmaceutical products 
in  million of operating expenses were in research and development  compared to million in  an increase of million for as compared to costs related to prestara were approximately million higher in due to our frequent meetings with the fda and initiation of a confirmatory phase iii clinical trial for prestara for lupus 
costs for genelabs drug discovery efforts increased by million in compared to  as we built additional discovery research capabilities in chemistry and pharmacokinetics while initiating a new project directed towards discovery of a new treatment for infection with the hepatitis c virus 
the prestara and drug discovery projects are both ongoing 
in we plan to incur a higher level of costs for prestara as we conduct a phase iii clinical study evaluating the ability of prestara to prevent bone loss in lupus patients on glucocorticoids 
in we plan to continue our drug discovery efforts  but also plan to incur lower drug discovery costs due to reductions in personnel early in while we have maintained our core research capabilities  our cost containment efforts will constrain our ability to undertake additional discovery projects while we continue our antifungal and hcv programs 
costs beyond the year will depend on many factors  including the outcome of our bone density clinical trial  decisions made by the u 
s food and drug administration  the outcome of scientific experiments and funding available to the company 
in  million in operating expenses were general and administrative expenses  compared to million in  a decrease of million 
lower general and administrative costs were incurred in compared to as a result of the resolution of a legal matter in and cost savings measures implemented in substantially all administrative areas 
future general and administrative expenses will vary depending upon our execution of our business plans 
nonoperating expenses 
interest income was million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates and lower average cash and short term investment balances during than during in  we recorded million in income from the discontinued operations of genelabs diagnostics pte 
ltd  a decrease from million in income for largely due to lower sales of diagnostics products 
years ended december  and introduction 
genelabs net loss was million in  an increase of million from the million net loss in this increase is primarily the result of lower contract revenue in and higher general and administrative costs  partially offset by higher interest income and lower prestara development costs 
a more detailed discussion of the changes in genelabs statement of operations follows 
contract revenue 
contract revenues were million in  a decrease of million from million in contract revenues in in  approximately of revenue  or million  was the recognition into income of a previously received up front license payment from watson 
in  this source of revenue increased by million over the million recorded as revenue from watson in  because the agreements with watson were signed in late and a full year of the up front payment amortization was recognized in but not in in and  this up front license fee from watson was deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis through march  aside from the revenue recognized from watson  none of our other sources of revenue for exceeded million 
other sources of revenue include data analysis services performed for larger pharmaceutical companies  royalties and grants 
revenues in from genelabs defense advanced research projects agency darpa grant were million  compared to million in  a decrease of million in due to the grant s scheduled expiration in early none of the other revenue changes for compared to were material 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million in  a decrease of million from the million in operating expenses in all operating expenses are related to genelabs business of discovering and developing pharmaceutical products 
in  million of operating expenses were in research and development  compared to million in  a decrease of million for as compared to costs related to prestara were approximately million lower in due to completion in of certain externally conducted toxicology studies and our purchase in of bulk drug supply in preparation for manufacturing validation of commercial product lots 
partially offsetting these decreases in prestara costs were higher costs incurred in for external medical consultants as we prepared for and participated in various meetings with the fda 
costs for genelabs drug discovery efforts decreased million in compared to  as marginal cost reductions related to the scheduled expiration of genelabs grant from darpa in early were largely offset with increased expenditures related to genelabs own drug discovery efforts 
in  million in operating expenses were general and administrative expenses  compared to million in  an increase of million 
higher general and administrative costs were incurred in compared to as we incurred costs preparing for the potential commercial introduction of prestara and resolved a legal matter 
future general and administrative expenses will vary depending upon our execution of our business plans 
nonoperating expenses 
interest income was million in  an increase of million from the increase in interest income was due to higher average cash and short term investment balances during than during in  we recorded million in income from the discontinued operations of genelabs diagnostics pte 
ltd  referred to as gld 
this amount reflects the net income of this subsidiary after it settled an hiv patent infringement suit that was brought in singapore 
liquidity and capital resources genelabs had cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances totaling million at december  during  our cash and short term investments balance decreased by million  largely due to million cash used in operations and partially offset by proceeds of million raised in a common stock offering 
the cash used in operations funded our development of prestara for lupus  the continued research on antimicrobial compounds discovered in our dna targeted drug discovery program and the initiation of a new research project directed towards the discovery of a new treatment for hepatitis c virus infection 
the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations and to obtain additional capital 
the company is aggressively seeking funding in order to satisfy its projected cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
the company is aggressively seeking funding in order to satisfy its projected cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
the company is pursuing the close of the sale of its diagnostics operation and also renegotiating the terms of a key collaboration  which  if completed  the company expects would provide additional cash resources to the company 
the company may be unable to complete either of these transactions as currently contemplated or at all 
while these are in process  our board of directors has approved  and we are implementing a plan to furlough a majority of our employees in order to conserve short term resources 
under the furlough program  genelabs expects that it will have sufficient resources to meet its operational needs through the end of may the company is also evaluating the sale of non core assets and exploring potential partnerships as additional ways to fund operations 
however  the company will continue to rely on outside sources of financing to meet its capital needs 
the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time 
further  there can be no assurance  assuming the company successfully raises additional funds  that the company will achieve positive cash flow 
if the company is not able to secure additional funding  in addition to the furlough program  the company will be required to scale back its research and development programs  preclinical studies and clinical trials  and selling  general  and administrative activities and may not be able to continue in business 
these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the specific amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities  which might be necessary should the company be unable to continue in business 
the following are illustrations of potential impediments to our ability to successfully secure additional funds o our stock price and market capitalization are low  therefore there are limited funds we can raise through equity financings  o our ability to successfully complete an equity financing would be negatively impacted if we should become unable to meet nasdaq s listing requirements  o our ability to find a european marketing partner for prestara would be negatively impacted if we receive indications that the emea s review of our maa is unlikely to result in approval of our application  and o our research programs are in an early stage  therefore there are fewer opportunities to enter into collaborations with other companies and up front payments for early stage pharmaceutical research collaborations are generally smaller for projects that are further from potential marketability 
longer term  if we succeed in securing sufficient capital to allow us to complete the clinical trial for prestara  genelabs liquidity and capital resources will potentially be materially impacted by fda actions with respect to our nda for prestara 
if prestara is approved for marketing in the us  genelabs may receive a one time milestone payment of up to million from watson 
receipt of a milestone payment from watson would materially improve genelabs liquidity and capital resources 
however  genelabs believes that the most important impact of the watson collaboration for genelabs long term liquidity and capital resources is the significant royalties genelabs is entitled to receive on net sales of prestara 
during the first three quarters after product launch  a separate royalty schedule applies to support the product launch 
since genelabs inception  the company has operated at a loss and has funded operations primarily through public and private offerings of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  contract revenues 
we expect to incur substantial additional costs  including research costs for drug discovery and development costs for prestara 
the amount of additional costs in our business plans will depend on numerous factors including any fda actions  progress of our research and development programs and the status of corporate partnership agreements 
additional funds for our research and development activities may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the unavailability of additional funds could delay or prevent the development  approval or marketing of some or all of our products and technologies  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other contractual arrangements 
genelabs principal research  clinical development and office facilities are leased from third parties under operating leases 
as such  genelabs expenses its facility rental costs as those costs are incurred over the term of the lease 
other than the facility operating leases and a loan on a single piece of laboratory equipment  genelabs does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
there are no contractual financial obligations that extend beyond the next five years  although we have an option to extend our current operating lease for a four year period beyond its current expiration in november our contractual obligations for the next five years are as follows less than one to three three to one year years five years total in thousands operating leases     equipment loans total     item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk genelabs exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s short term investments 
we consider the risk minimal as each security in our portfolio of short term investments matures in less than two years  to date we have not used derivative instruments  and we have placed our investments with high quality debt issuers 
as of december   the overall average maturity of genelabs short term investment portfolio was less than six months  leaving little exposure to changes in interest rates 
genelabs exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the company s investment in a taiwan based biopharmaceutical company  genovate biotechnology co  ltd  which is accounted for at cost  based on the lower of cost or market value method 
this investment is the only item included in the balance sheet caption long term investments 
genelabs may attempt to divest a portion of this investment  in which case changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the proceeds received upon sale of these shares 
because the book value of genelabs ownership percentage of genovate is greater than our carrying cost  we currently do not believe that any foreign currency exchange rate changes would impact the value of this investment as reported in the financial statements unless the value of a taiwan dollar depreciates by greater than compared to the us dollar  which  depending on other circumstances  might require genelabs to record a non cash charge to write down the long term investment
