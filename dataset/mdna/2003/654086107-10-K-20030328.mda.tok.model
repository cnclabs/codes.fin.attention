item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this financial review is to explain changes in operating results and financial condition from to and to discuss business trends and uncertainties that might affect nicor inc nicor 
certain terms used herein are defined in the glossary on page i 
summary nicor s two major subsidiaries  nicor gas and tropical shipping  operate in two business segments gas distribution and shipping 
all of nicor s other wholly owned businesses are combined and presented as other energy ventures 
the gas distribution segment represents the majority of consolidated operating income and assets 
net income and diluted earnings per common share are presented below net income millions diluted earnings per share nicor s net income and earnings per share were significantly impacted by the effects of nicor gas mercury inspection and repair program in  and a charge of million was recorded as operating expense in to establish a reserve related to the program 
in and  the recognition of partial recoveries from insurers and contractors and reserve reductions lowered operating expenses by million and million  respectively 
for details of nicor gas mercury inspection and repair program  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements mercury program beginning on page net income was higher in compared with due primarily to increased insurance recoveries at the company s gas distribution segment related to the mercury inspection and repair program  partially offset by other operating income reductions in the gas distribution segment 
lower net interest expense  and operating income improvements in the shipping segment  also contributed to the improvement 
net income was significantly higher in compared with due primarily to the mercury related charge recorded in and related cost recoveries and a reserve reduction recorded in in the gas distribution segment 
this increase was partially offset by other gas distribution operating income reductions and lower operating results in the shipping segment 
also reflects increased interest income from higher short term investment balances and lower interest expense due to lower interest rates 
per share results in both and benefited from the company s common stock repurchase programs 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operating income 
operating income loss by major business segment is presented below in millions gas distribution shipping other energy ventures corporate and eliminations the following summarizes operating income comparisons by business segment gas distribution operating income increased million in the improvement reflects million of pretax mercury related insurance recoveries and positive reserve adjustments in compared to million in the prior year 
annual results were also impacted favorably by lower losses related to a performance based rate pbr plan million  increased natural gas deliveries unrelated to weather million and colder weather million 
results were negatively impacted by higher operating costs  including lower pension credits million  increased legal and accounting costs related primarily to the pbr plan review million  higher depreciation million and higher health care costs million 
gas distribution operating income increased million in compared to reflecting a million change in mercury related costs and recoveries  increased contributions from the chicago hub million  which provides gas supply related services  and increased pension credits million 
the above improvements were partially offset by the impact of greater losses from the pbr plan million  reduced natural gas deliveries million  certain increased operating expenses related to higher average natural gas prices million and increased depreciation million 
tropical shipping operating income for increased million compared to due to increased revenues from higher volumes shipped million attributable primarily to recent acquisitions  partially offset by the impact of higher operating expenses million and lower average rates million due primarily to increased volumes shipped as a result of recent acquisitions and unfavorable economic conditions throughout the caribbean region 
a slowdown in the us and caribbean economies resulted in a decrease in shipping operating income of million in the negative revenue impact of lower volumes shipped million in more than offset the positive effects of slightly higher average rates million  due primarily to a change in product and route mix  and lower operating and maintenance expenses million 
other energy ventures operating income for decreased 
million compared to higher operating results in the company s energy related products and services business million  nicor services  were more than offset by increased losses from the company s former energy system development activities million 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operating income from nicor s other energy ventures was essentially unchanged in improved operating results from nicor services million and increased operating income relating to the company s former energy system development activities million were more than offset by a decline in operating income from a small venture that had a large one time project in million 
equity investment income loss 
equity investment income loss was million in compared to 
million in and million in lower results in reflect a million investment loss from nicor energy  nicor s retail energy marketing joint venture  compared with a loss of 
million in other income expense 
other income expense  net was million in  million in  and million in the fluctuation from year to year was due primarily to short term investment levels and the resulting effect on interest income 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million in due to lower average borrowing levels and interest rates 
interest expense decreased million in due primarily to the positive effect of lower interest rates 
income taxes 
the percent effective income tax rate for varied from its historical level due to much lower pretax income related to the mercury charge at nicor gas 
lower pretax income typically results in a lower effective income tax rate because tax credits and other permanent tax differences represent a larger share of pretax income 
results of operations details of various financial and operating information by segment can be found in the tables throughout this review 
the following discussion summarizes the major items impacting nicor s results of operations 
operating revenues 
operating revenues by major business segment are presented below in millions gas distribution shipping other energy ventures corporate and eliminations gas distribution revenues decreased in due primarily to significantly lower average natural gas costs  which are passed directly through to customers without markup 
the revenue effect of the lower average natural gas costs is estimated to be approximately million 
the revenue effect of the lower natural gas costs was partially offset by the impact of colder weather million in compared to in  shipping segment results included higher volume related revenues million partially offset by lower average rates million 
the increases in volume related revenues resulted primarily from acquisitions 
the slow economy in the caribbean region continued to put pressure on shipping segment average rates 
the increase in revenues for other energy ventures was due primarily to increased business activity at nicor services 
nicor services revenues increased million in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued to million 
partially offsetting this increase were decreased revenues from former energy system development activities million 
the increase in gas distribution revenues from was due primarily to significantly higher average natural gas costs and related revenue taxes 
the revenue effect of the higher average natural gas costs in compared to is approximately million 
partially offsetting the effect of higher average gas costs were the estimated effects of lower deliveries million due to warmer weather  energy conservation and economic conditions 
the decline in shipping revenues in reflects the effect of lower volumes million compared to the prior year 
reduced volumes were due to a slowdown in the economy  which resulted in lower construction and tourist related shipments in the caribbean region 
the increase in revenues for other energy ventures was due primarily to increased business from nicor s former energy system development activities million and new customers and products at nicor services million 
partially offsetting these increases was the decline in activity at a small venture million that had a large one time project in gas distribution margin 
nicor utilizes a measure it refers to as gas distribution margin to evaluate the operating income impact of gas distribution revenues 
gas distribution revenues include gas costs  which are passed directly through to customers without markup  and revenue taxes  for which nicor gas earns only a small administrative fee 
these items often cause significant fluctuations in gas distribution revenues  and yet they have virtually no direct impact on gas distribution operating income 
therefore  nicor gas and many other gas utility companies exclude these items in evaluating performance 
a reconciliation of gas distribution revenues and margin follows in millions gas distribution revenues cost of gas revenue tax expense gas distribution margin gas distribution margin increased million in contributing to the improvement were lower pbr plan losses compared to million 
additional information related to the pbr plan is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contingencies performance based rate plan beginning on page other factors affecting margin in were the positive effects of increased natural gas deliveries unrelated to weather million and colder weather million  and the negative effect of lower revenues from customer finance charges million 
the reduction of revenues from customer finance charges is related to lower levels of customer receivables arising from reduced natural gas prices in gas distribution margin in was million lower than in positively affecting the margin were greater customer finance charges million and larger contributions from the chicago hub million 
lower customer demand million and increased pbr plan losses million negatively impacted results in reduced customer demand for natural gas in resulted from warmer weather  energy conservation and economic conditions 
the negative impact of warmer weather in versus million was partially offset by benefits from the company s weather protection million 
gas distribution operating and maintenance expense 
gas distribution operating and maintenance expense for and was million and million  respectively 
the million increase reflects smaller pension credits million  increased legal and accounting costs related item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued primarily to the pbr plan review million and increased health care costs million 
these increases were partially offset by lower natural gas costs to operate company equipment and facilities million 
gas distribution operating and maintenance expense was million in  up million from the increase in was due largely to increased bad debt expense million and higher natural gas costs to operate company equipment and facilities million resulting from higher natural gas prices 
partially offsetting these increases were higher pension credits million in compared to gas distribution operating and maintenance expense included pension credits of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for more details concerning fluctuations in the gas distribution s pension credits  see the factors affecting business performance gas distribution pension investment returns section on page gas distribution mercury related costs recoveries 
mercury related costs recoveries reflect the estimated costs  credits and recoveries associated with the company s mercury inspection and repair program 
in  nicor gas reached an agreement with an insurer whereby the company recovered approximately million of mercury related costs 
in both and  a million adjustment lowered the mercury related reserve and reduced operating expense 
operating income for also reflected million in mercury related recoveries 
the million of mercury related costs in represents the original charge to establish the mercury program reserve 
additional information about the company s mercury inspection and repair program is presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contingencies mercury program beginning on page gas distribution property sale gains losses 
property sale gains and losses vary from year to year depending upon property sales activity 
the company continues to assess its ownership of real estate holdings 
shipping operating expenses 
shipping segment operating expenses rose million in due primarily to increased volumes shipped as a result of recent acquisitions 
increased costs included higher transportation and voyage costs million  greater leased equipment costs million  higher wage and benefit costs million and increased vessel charter expenses million 
for  shipping segment operating expenses decreased million due primarily to lower volumes shipped 
decreased volume related expenses included lower port costs million  lower fuel costs million and decreased wage and benefit expenses million 
all other operating expenses 
the million increase in all other operating expenses was due primarily to increased expenses at nicor services million associated largely with the addition of new customers and products  such as the fixed bill product described in the following factors affecting business performance section 
the increase at nicor services included million of fixed bill operating expenses that were eliminated against gas distribution revenues in nicor s consolidated financial statements 
the increase at nicor services was partially offset by lower operating expenses from nicor s former energy system development activities million and its gas distribution technology business million 
the increase in all other operating expenses in compared to was associated largely with increased business from nicor s former energy system development activities million

these resources include net cash flow from operating activities  access to capital markets  lines of credit and short term investments 
operating cash flows 
net cash flow provided from operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
year to year changes in operating cash flow result largely from fluctuations in working capital items occurring mainly in the gas distribution segment because of factors including weather  the price of natural gas  the timing of collections from customers and gas purchasing practices 
operating cash flows increased significantly in due primarily to changes in amounts due from customers and accounts payable balances associated with natural gas price volatility 
the company generally relies on short term financing to meet temporary increases in working capital needs 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures by business segment are presented below in millions estimated gas distribution shipping other energy ventures the increase in capital expenditures in the gas distribution segment was related to the acquisition of a compressor for a storage facility and higher capitalized employee benefit costs 
gas distribution capital expenditures were higher in than in due primarily to increased information technology projects and improvements to the company s operating system 
shipping segment capital expenditures were higher in and than the and anticipated levels due primarily to the construction of two vessels 
expenditures were lower in and are expected to be further reduced in because vessel construction was completed in early other investments 
nicor invested million in each of  and in a cargo container leasing business and will likely invest a similar amount in nicor s equity investment in this business at december  was million 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in may nicor invested million for a percent share of equity in horizon pipeline 
nicor s equity investment in this business at december  was million 
additional information about horizon pipeline is presented on page nicor s equity investment in nicor energy  including an million note receivable  was written down to zero during the third quarter of additional information about transactions with nicor energy is provided within the nicor energy section of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contingencies beginning on page in both and  nicor services acquired a heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac company 
in march  nicor services acquired a third hvac company 
all purchases were made with shares of nicor stock 
nicor services has no current plans for further hvac acquisitions 
in october  tropical shipping acquired the container assets of kent line international for cash 
with this acquisition  tropical shipping began offering canadian customers an all water service from new brunswick  canada  to tropical shipping s network of caribbean destinations and florida 
in april  tropical shipping also purchased certain assets of tecmarine lines inc and tmx logistics inc 
for cash  expanding its network of caribbean and south american destinations 
financing activities 
as of the filing date of this report  nicor gas has long term debt ratings that are among the highest in the gas distribution industry 
because of uncertainties pertaining to the energy industry in general and to the company  as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contingencies beginning on page  the rating agencies put nicor and nicor gas long term debt ratings under review for possible downgrade or on credit watch with negative implications in moody s investors service and fitch ratings have also put both companies commercial paper on credit watch 
on november   fitch ratings lowered its rating on nicor gas long term debt to aa from aa and lowered its rating on nicor inc s short term debt to f from f 
nicor gas f short term debt rating was unchanged 
lower ratings could cause higher interest costs 
nicor s financial statistics at december include long term debt  net of current maturities  as a percent of capitalization times interest earned  before income taxes interest coverage for was negatively affected by the unusual mercury related charge 
long term debt 
nicor is in compliance with its debt covenants and believes it will remain so even if its debt ratings are lowered 
nicor s long term debt agreements do not include ratings triggers or material adverse change provisions 
net proceeds from securities issued are typically used for refinancing outstanding debt  construction programs to the extent not provided by internally generated funds  and general corporate purposes 
in april  nicor gas issued million of percent unsecured notes due in april with the proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes 
nicor gas plans to refinance at least million of long term debt in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in  nicor gas issued the following first mortgage bonds million due in at  million due in at  million due in at  and million due in at 
retirements of first mortgage bonds in were as follows million due in at  million due in at  million due in at  and million due in at 
during  nicor gas also retired million of variable rate unsecured notes 
as a result of these activities  nicor s weighted average interest rate for long term debt at december  was compared with at december  in january  nicor gas issued million of variable rate unsecured notes due in at an initial rate of to fund the redemption of million of unsecured notes at due in short term debt 
at december   the company had line of credit agreements with five major domestic and foreign banks 
these agreements  which serve as backup for the issuance of commercial paper  allow for borrowings of up to million through march  and million thereafter through september  at december  the company had million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
nicor had million of commercial paper outstanding at year end under the company s short term line of credit agreements  if nicor s ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to capitalization including short term debt exceeds during the term of the credit facility while there are short term bank loans outstanding  each bank may at its option declare any amounts due immediately payable and or terminate its commitment to make advances to the company 
the company expects that commercial paper funding will continue to be available in the foreseeable future 
common stock 
in  nicor completed a million common stock repurchase program initiated in the third quarter of and announced a new million common stock repurchase program 
purchases may be made as market conditions permit through open market transactions and to the extent cash flow is available after other cash needs and investment opportunities 
the company purchased and retired 
million  million and million common shares in  and  respectively  at a cost of million  million and million  respectively  under the stock repurchase program 
at december   approximately million remained authorized for the repurchase of common stock under the existing program 
since january  the company has repurchased over one quarter of its outstanding stock 
nicor increased its quarterly common stock dividend rate during by percent  which was the fifteenth consecutive annual increase 
on march   the nicor board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 
per common share  increasing the rate by 
the company paid dividends on its common stock of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
nicor currently has no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends 
commitments 
for a summary of nicor s contractual obligations  refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements contractual obligations beginning on page in addition to its contractual obligations  nicor could be required to provide funding on behalf of related parties under guarantee arrangements if certain contingent events occur 
these guarantees are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements related party transactions on page  the notes to the consolidated financial statements guarantees and indemnities on page and the notes to the consolidated financial statements contingencies nicor energy beginning on page other 
restrictions imposed by regulatory agencies and loan agreements limiting the amount of subsidiary net assets that can be transferred to nicor are not expected to have a material impact on the company s ability to meet its cash obligations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting business performance the following factors can impact year to year comparisons and may affect the future performance of nicor s businesses 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
nicor prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which regularly require nicor management to exercise judgment in the selection and application of accounting methods 
the application of accounting methods includes making estimates using subjective assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the selection of accounting methods and the use of estimates affect nicor s reported results and financial condition 
the company has adopted several significant accounting policies that are important to understanding its financial statements and are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements accounting policies beginning on page management is also required to make significant estimates  which are similarly described in the footnotes 
although there are numerous areas in which nicor management makes significant estimates or judgments  it believes its critical estimates or judgments involve derivative instruments  unbilled revenues  credit risk and loss contingencies because they are susceptible to material change and could materially impact nicor s financial statements 
the rules for determining whether a contract meets the criteria for a derivative instrument  or whether a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment  are numerous and complex 
the treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections and changes in management s assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions 
as a result  management judgment is required in the determination of the appropriate accounting treatment 
in addition  the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market projections  and changes in hedge effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment 
these determinations and changes in estimates may have a material impact on reported results 
certain nicor subsidiaries estimate revenues for gas deliveries not billed to customers from the last billing date to month end unbilled revenues 
unbilled revenue estimates are dependent upon a number of factors which require management judgment  including projections of gas costs  weather  and customer usage 
these estimates are adjusted when actual billings occur  and changes in estimates can be material 
nicor s estimated unbilled revenues at december   were million 
nicor s subsidiaries and affiliates are required to estimate credit risk in establishing allowances for doubtful accounts and in estimating the fair values of certain derivative instruments and energy related trading contracts  with counterparty credit risk being an especially difficult and critical judgment 
actual credit losses could vary materially from nicor s estimates 
nicor s estimated allowance for doubtful accounts at december   was million 
nicor records loss contingencies as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
nicor and its subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in various legal proceedings and exposed to various loss contingencies see discussion in contingencies beginning on page and the notes to the consolidated financial statements contingencies  beginning on page 
these loss contingencies are in some cases resolved in stages over time  estimates may change significantly from period to period  and the company s ultimate obligations may differ materially from its estimates 
of particular note is the pbr plan contingency described in contingencies performance item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued based rate plan beginning on page and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contingencies performance based rate plan beginning on page gas distribution 
nicor gas  a regulated natural gas distribution utility  serves two million customers in a service territory that encompasses most of the northern third of illinois  excluding the city of chicago 
the region s economy is diverse and has grown steadily over the years  providing nicor gas with a well balanced mix of residential  commercial and industrial customers 
in  residential  commercial and industrial customers accounted for approximately percent  percent and percent of natural gas deliveries  respectively 
weather 
since about one half of gas deliveries are used for space heating  fluctuations in weather have the potential to significantly impact year to year comparisons of operating income and cash flow 
nicor estimates that  excluding weather protection  every degree day variation in weather has an impact on earnings per share of approximately cents 
since  nicor gas has purchased earnings protection against the impact of significantly warmer weather 
to partially offset the cost of this protection  beginning in nicor gas agreed to pay its counterparty if weather is colder than an approximate normal 
thus far for  weather protection has been purchased for only the first quarter and the agreement stipulates that the maximum payment received or amount paid out will not exceed million 
demand and natural gas prices 
in addition to the impact of weather  significant changes in economic conditions or natural gas prices can impact customer gas usage 
however  nicor gas large residential customer base provides relative stability during weak economic periods  and the industrial and commercial customer base is well diversified  lessening the impact of industry specific economic swings 
nicor gas growth in natural gas deliveries has traditionally come from customer additions and increased usage by existing commercial and industrial customers  including power generation facilities 
although commercial and industrial deliveries declined in  they increased in and the company anticipates continued long term growth attributable to these factors 
a partial offset is expected as customers install more energy efficient equipment 
changes in the price of natural gas have no direct impact on nicor gas margin since gas costs are passed directly through to customers without markup 
however  high natural gas prices can have an adverse effect on accounts receivable collections  customer demand  company use gas expenses  financing costs and customer service expenses 
competition 
nicor gas competes with other energy suppliers based on such factors as price  service and reliability 
the company believes that it is well positioned to deal with the possibility of fuel switching by customers because it has rates and services designed to compete against alternative fuels 
in addition  the company has a rate that allows negotiation with potential bypass customers  and no customer has bypassed the nicor gas system since the rate became effective in nicor gas also offers commercial and industrial customers alternatives in rates and service  increasing its ability to compete in these markets 
storage and supply 
nicor gas has a direct connection to multiple interstate pipelines and extensive underground storage capacity that provides the company and its transportation customers with flexibility and alternatives for natural gas supply procurement and storage services 
in addition  in an effort to ensure supply reliability  the company purchases gas from several different producing regions under varied contract terms 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued customer choice of commodity supplier 
the company s customer select program offers customers a choice of natural gas suppliers 
nicor gas made its customer select program available to all residential customers beginning in march previously  supplier choice was available to only industrial customers and  under a customer select pilot program  all commercial customers and about percent of residential customers 
in the pilot program s first four years  about one third of eligible business customers and one quarter of eligible residential customers signed up 
the choice of another natural gas commodity supplier has no direct impact on nicor gas distribution margin because natural gas costs are passed directly through to customers without markup 
nicor gas continues to deliver the natural gas  maintain its distribution system and respond to emergencies 
customer credit risk 
nicor gas has a diversified customer base  which limits its exposure to concentrations of credit risk in any one industry or income class 
the company believes that it maintains prudent credit policies  subject to icc regulations 
customers also have options to help them manage their bills  such as energy assistance programs for low income customers and a budget payment plan that spreads gas bills more evenly throughout the year 
however  high natural gas prices can increase the risk of customer nonpayment 
nicor gas experienced increased bad debt expense in  and that was higher than historical levels due primarily to significantly higher natural gas prices 
it is expected that higher natural gas prices will continue in see also the credit risk section on page pension investment returns 
nicor gas maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees hired prior to net income related to net periodic benefit credits represented percent  percent and percent of nicor s net income in   and  respectively 
the percentage was significantly affected by nicor s lower net income in  which resulted from the unusual mercury program charge 
for actuarial valuation purposes  nicor gas utilizes an october measurement date to determine the company s pension expense or credit for the subsequent calendar year 
during the months ended september   the pension plans experienced poor investment returns consistent with general market conditions  negatively impacting the company s operating income 
the company s pension credit included in operating income in was million compared to million in the october  actuarial valuation reflected even lower asset values which  along with changes in actuarial assumptions  will lead to a materially lower pension credit for  reducing operating income by about million 
actuarial assumptions affecting include an expected rate of return on plan assets of and a discount rate of 
the pension plans are adequately funded  and recent market performance is not expected to impact participant benefits or future company contributions 
however  further substantial declines in market performance or changes to actuarial assumptions could require future company contributions 
nontraditional activities 
nicor gas continues to pursue nontraditional activities  including the chicago hub  which provides natural gas transportation and storage services 
the chicago area is a major market hub for natural gas  and demand exists for storage related and transmission related services by marketers  other gas distribution companies and electric power generation facilities 
during  and  the chicago hub contributed to operating income million  million and million  respectively 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued regulation 
nicor gas is regulated by the icc  which establishes the rules and regulations governing utility rates and services in illinois 
rates are generally designed to allow the company to recover its costs and provide an opportunity to earn a fair return for its investors 
significant changes in the regulations applicable to nicor gas or its affiliates  or the regulatory environment in general  could affect the performance of nicor gas 
information regarding certain icc proceedings is presented within the contingencies performance based rate plan section beginning on page and within the notes to the consolidated financial statements contingencies performance based rate plan beginning on page in addition  nicor gas provides certain ferc regulated storage and transportation services  and information concerning ferc regulated activities is discussed in the contingencies hub services section and in the contingencies other ferc matters section on page outlook 
due to the absence of the positive mercury related impacts that occurred in and an anticipated increase in pension  health care and insurance costs  lower gas distribution results are expected in shipping 
tropical shipping is one of the largest containerized cargo carriers in the caribbean region 
tropical shipping has a reputation for providing quality  on time delivery service a reputation that has helped the company establish a leading position in most of the markets it serves 
the company is a major carrier of exports from the east coast of the united states and canada to the caribbean region 
the company s shipments consist primarily of southbound cargo such as building materials  food and other necessities for developers  manufacturers and residents in the caribbean  as well as tourist related shipments intended for use in hotels and resorts  and on cruise ships 
the balance of tropical shipping s cargo consists of northbound shipments of agricultural products and apparel  and interisland shipments 
tropical shipping s financial results can be affected significantly by general economic conditions in the united states  the caribbean region and canada 
the caribbean marketplace is very competitive  with global carriers having established a presence in several markets that tropical shipping serves 
tropical shipping is continuing to meet these challenges by focusing on superior customer service  controlling costs  and maximizing the efficiency and utilization of its vessel fleet and shore assets 
in  tropical shipping ordered the construction of two vessels to replace older owned and chartered vessels  and to support growth 
the first vessel was placed into service in late  and the second vessel was delivered in early in october  tropical shipping acquired the container assets of kent line international for cash 
with this acquisition  tropical shipping began offering canadian customers an all water service from new brunswick  canada  to tropical shipping s network of caribbean destinations and florida 
the acquisition has the potential to increase tropical shipping s annual volumes by about percent 
in april  tropical shipping also purchased certain assets of tecmarine lines inc and tmx logistics inc 
for cash  expanding its network of caribbean and south american destinations 
the acquisition has the potential to increase tropical shipping s annual volumes by approximately percent 
nicor anticipates modest growth in the shipping segment in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other energy ventures 
nicor is involved in several other energy venture businesses including nicor services  nicor enerchange  nicor energy and horizon pipeline 
nicor services provides energy related products and services for retail markets  including residential and small commercial users 
the company offers products and services covering the installation  maintenance and repair of heating and air conditioning related equipment  including gas piping and other appliances 
in  the company also began offering a fixed bill product under which it pays the annual gas service portion of a nicor gas customer s utility bill in exchange for twelve equal monthly payments by the customer to nicor services  regardless of changes in the price of natural gas or weather 
nicor services contributed million in operating income in  compared with million in and million in nicor enerchange is a natural gas marketing company formed in to engage in wholesale marketing and trading of natural gas supply services primarily in the midwest 
nicor enerchange also administers the nicor gas chicago hub for a fee 
the company focuses on opportunities that allow it to leverage its knowledge of natural gas movement in and around the midwest 
changes in the availability of storage capacity may negatively impact the results of nicor enerchange 
nicor enerchange contributed million of operating income in  compared with million in and million in beginning in  nicor enerchange results will be subject to an increased risk of potential volatility caused by the adoption of a new accounting method 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements energy trading accounting methods on page nicor is a percent owner of nicor energy  a retail energy marketing joint venture with dynegy marketing and trade 
in  nicor recorded a pretax loss of million associated with this investment 
nicor energy is in the process of liquidating its assets 
for factors affecting nicor energy see the notes to the consolidated financial statements contingencies nicor energy beginning on page during the second quarter of horizon pipeline  a percent owned joint venture with natural gas pipeline company of america  put into operation a mile  inch pipeline from joliet  illinois to near the wisconsin illinois border 
horizon pipeline s capacity is nearly fully subscribed under year agreements  with nicor gas having contracted for approximately percent of the mmcf per day initial capacity 
horizon pipeline contributed million of pretax earnings in market risk 
nicor is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations  including the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas and fuel commodity prices and interest rates 
it is nicor s practice to manage these risks utilizing derivative instruments and other methods  as deemed appropriate 
commodity price risk 
with regard to commodity price risk  the company has established policies and procedures governing the management of such risks and the use of derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to such risks 
a risk management committee oversees compliance with such policies and procedures 
the company utilizes various techniques to limit  measure and monitor market risk  including limits based on volume  dollar amounts  and duration  and in some cases value at risk var 
var is the potential loss for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors  for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level 
the company s risk management committee has established exposure limits at such a level that material adverse economic results are not expected 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued however  beginning in  the accounting results for any one period are subject to potential volatility caused by the adoption of the new accounting model at nicor enerchange 
the company s commodity price risk policies and procedures continue to evolve with its businesses and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec disclosure requirements  nicor performs sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in earnings based upon a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices 
management does not believe that sensitivity analyses alone provide an accurate or reliable method for monitoring and controlling risks and therefore also relies on the experience and judgment of its management to revise strategies and adjust positions as deemed necessary 
losses in excess of the amounts determined in sensitivity analyses could occur if market prices exceed the percent shift used for the analyses 
based on the company s unhedged positions at december   a percent decrease in natural gas prices would have decreased nicor s earnings at december  by about 
million  which is not materially different than in the prior year 
in addition  substantial increases in natural gas prices may indirectly impact nicor gas earnings by increasing the cost of gas used by the company  bad debt expense and other operating expenses 
higher natural gas prices may also lead to lower customer gas consumption and margin 
the company is addressing certain of these risks with fixed rate purchase agreements  futures contracts and swap agreements to reduce the financial impacts arising from natural gas price changes 
nicor s regulated utility  nicor gas  is generally not exposed to market risk caused by changes in commodity prices because of illinois rate regulation allowing for the recovery of prudently incurred natural gas supply costs from customers 
however  nicor gas pbr plan for natural gas costs created some exposure to commodity price risk 
the company s exposure to this market risk was partially mitigated because the pbr plan compared actual gas costs to a market sensitive benchmark as opposed to a fixed benchmark

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued contingencies 
the following contingencies of nicor are in various stages of investigation or disposition 
although the company is unable to estimate the amount of loss reasonably possible in addition to any amounts already recognized  it is possible that the resolution of these contingencies  either individually or in aggregate  will require the company to take charges against  or will result in reductions in  future earnings 
it is the opinion of management that the resolution of these contingencies  either individually or in aggregate  could be material to earnings in a particular period  but is not expected to have a material adverse impact on nicor s liquidity or financial condition 
performance based rate plan 
nicor gas pbr plan for natural gas costs went into effect in and was terminated by the company effective january  under the pbr plan  nicor gas total gas supply costs were compared to a market sensitive benchmark 
savings and losses relative to the benchmark were determined annually and shared equally with sales customers 
the pbr plan is currently under illinois commerce commission icc review 
there are allegations that the company acted improperly in connection with the pbr plan  and the icc is reviewing these allegations 
on june  the citizens utility board cub filed a motion to reopen the record in the icc s proceedings to review the pbr plan the icc proceedings 
as a result of the motion to reopen  nicor gas  the cook county state s attorney s office ccsao  the staff of the icc and cub entered into a stipulation providing for additional discovery 
the illinois attorney general s office has also intervened in this matter 
in addition  the illinois attorney general s office issued civil investigation demands cids to cub and the icc staff 
the cids ordered that cub and the icc staff produce all documents relating to any claims that nicor gas may have presented  or caused to be presented  false information related to its pbr plan 
the securities and exchange commission sec and the office of the united states attorney for the northern district of illinois are also reviewing the allegations that the company acted improperly in connection with the pbr plan 
the company has committed to cooperate fully in the reviews of the pbr plan 
nicor gas has responded to numerous data requests that have been propounded by the icc staff  cub  ccsao  the sec  the illinois attorney general s office and the office of the united states attorney for the northern district of illinois 
in response to these allegations  on july   the nicor board of directors appointed a special committee of independent  non management directors to conduct an inquiry into issues surrounding natural gas purchases  sales  transportation  storage and such other matters as may come to the attention of the special committee in the course of its investigation 
to conduct the inquiry  the special committee retained scott lassar of the law firm of sidley austin brown wood sidley  and sidley hired the accounting firm of kpmg llp 
mr 
lassar is the former united states attorney for the northern district of illinois 
the special committee presented the report of its counsel report to nicor s board of directors on october  the transmittal letter from the special committee to nicor s board of directors and mr 
lassar s report were filed with the sec on a form k on october  the findings of the report include certain transactions increased customer costs in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
no improper nicor affiliated party transactions or improper hedging activities were identified 
inadvertent accounting errors occurred  sometimes to the benefit of customers and sometimes to the benefit of nicor gas 
no criminal activity or fraud was identified 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in response  the nicor board of directors directed the company s management to make appropriate adjustments to account for  and fully address  the adverse consequences to ratepayers of the items noted in the report  undertake a financial statement re audit of to and a review of the first two quarters of  amend any filings with the icc  the sec or other regulatory agencies  as necessary  conduct a full audit of management fees paid by the company to third parties during and  conduct a detailed study of management bonus issues  and conduct a detailed study of the adequacy of internal accounting and regulatory controls 
nicor and nicor gas previously restated their  and annual financial statements and their and interim results to reflect corrections 
the audited restated financial statements were previously filed with the sec 
in addition  nicor and nicor gas have recorded additional charges in the fourth quarter of the items included in the report are reflected in the financial statements as follows amounts pretax the million of transactions identified in the report  as noted above 
million of these customer costs relate to transactions that required corrections to gas purchase costs or storage volumes from to the remaining million of the million identified in the report was recorded by nicor gas as a pbr plan loss contingency liability in the fourth quarter of the largest correction related to a late wholesale title transfer of natural gas from nicor gas storage inventory which had increased customers gas costs by approximately million 
the corrections also related to physical transfers of natural gas between nicor gas storage fields that were not consistently accounted for under the pbr plan and the improper classification of weather insurance premiums as cost of gas rather than operating expense 
these two items increased customers gas costs by a total of million 
the corrections to gas costs had no direct impact on pretax income because gas costs are passed directly through to customers without markup 
however  the gas cost and benchmark corrections did impact pbr plan results  as discussed below  and the weather insurance correction increased operating and maintenance expense by million 
changes in the timing of certain sales and purchases of natural gas inventory between nicor gas and independent third parties during the period december to the present 
nicor gas had previously recorded these transactions based upon when it held title to the natural gas  but there are additional criteria that were not applied in determining the accounting treatment  including those set forth in fasb statement no 
 accounting for product financing arrangements  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
for example  the level of economic interest in or control over the asset must be considered  which changes the timing of recognizing gas purchases and inventory in some of the third party storage arrangements 
in addition  in some instances a portion of the purchase cost is now classified as interest cost 
these corrections increased both inventory and accounts payable at december  and the corrections to gas costs had no direct impact on pretax income because gas costs are passed directly through to customers without markup 
however  the gas cost and benchmark corrections did impact pbr plan results  as discussed below  and interest expense increased by million and 
million in and  respectively 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued pbr plan results 
since the calendar year pbr plan calculations consider the cost of gas charged to customers and volumes withdrawn from inventory  which are both restated  pbr plan results have also changed and were reduced by million and million in and  respectively 
in addition to the corrections related to the report  as a result of management and audit reviews  the company also increased gas costs for transactions which had previously been recorded in the first quarter of this reduced nicor gas pbr plan results by million 
the adjustments noted above reduced nicor s and pretax gas distribution results by million and million  respectively 
the impact of the items listed above resulted in a reduction to net income for and of million and million  respectively 
because the pbr plan and historical utility gas costs are still under icc review  it is possible that the final outcome could be materially different than the amounts noted above 
pursuant to the agreement of all parties  including the company  the icc re opened the and purchased gas adjustment filings for review of certain transactions related to the pbr plan and consolidated the reviews of the purchased gas adjustment filings with the pbr plan review 
certain parties in the pbr plan review proceeding have indicated disagreement with the findings in the report or have indicated that they believe substantially greater adjustments or penalties are warranted 
in addition  on february   the ccsao and cub filed a motion for million in sanctions against the company in the icc proceedings 
in that motion  ccsao and cub alleged that nicor gas responses to certain cub data requests were false 
also on february   cub stated in a press release that  in addition to million in sanctions  it would seek refunds to consumers in an amount much greater than the million of adjustments identified in the report 
on march   the icc staff filed a response brief in support of cub s motion for sanctions 
it is not possible to determine how the icc will resolve the claims of ccsao  cub or other parties to the icc proceedings 
nicor is unable to predict the outcome of any of the foregoing reviews or the company s potential exposure thereunder beyond the amounts noted above 
also  due to the uncertainties surrounding the pbr plan  nicor gas has not recognized a million pretax gain from the pbr plan year 
in a letter dated october   nicor gas informed the icc that it was terminating its pbr plan effective january  on july   a purported class action was filed against nicor gas and nicor in the circuit court of cook county  illinois  on behalf of all customers of nicor gas who at any time from january through the present were subject to nicor gas pbr plan 
the named plaintiffs alleged breach of contract  unjust enrichment and violation of the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive practices act  and that the class sustained damages as a result of nicor gas manipulating the benchmark under the pbr plan 
the named plaintiffs sought  on behalf of themselves and the purported class  compensatory damages  prejudgment and postjudgment interest  disgorgement of all profits  and restitution to plaintiffs and the purported class 
nicor filed a motion to dismiss this action on september  on december   the named plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case  but indicated an intent to bring their claims before the icc 
nicor is unable to predict the outcome of any such proceeding or nicor s potential exposure related thereto and has not recorded a liability associated with the potential outcome of this contingency
