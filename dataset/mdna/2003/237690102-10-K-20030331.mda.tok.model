the reader should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
the following discussions and the section entitled business cautionary factors that may affect future results describes some  but not all  of the factors that could cause these differences 
business restructuring progress during  we continued the restructuring process from and recorded restructuring charges in the third and fourth quarter of of  and  respectively for a total of  associated with actions taken to reduce our breakeven point and realign data i o with our growth activities 
we required this operational repositioning because of the impact of the economic slowdown and the decline in capital spending across a high number of customer groups on general demand for programming equipment 
we reduced our quarterly breakeven point from approximately million of net sales at the beginning of to approximately million at the end of most of these reductions were achieved by reducing our personnel from at the beginning of to at the end of during  we took a number of strategic restructuring actions to reduce our breakeven point 
repositioning included the following a reduction in our global workforce from at the start of the year to at the end of  discontinuance or reallocation of numerous projects and activities not essential to our long term goals  streamlining activities to decrease discretionary marketing  distribution and promotional expenses  consolidation of numerous functions across the organization to create a team which was more productive and able to respond faster to global customer needs  and closure of a facility in germany and moving our operations to other locations within data i o 
at december  all restructuring expenses associated with the activities detailed above were paid except for approximately  which was primarily associated with severance  facility and consulting and legal fees 
we believe that the progress made in these areas positions us for a successful turnaround and profitable operations 
however  consistently profitable operations may not always be possible  nor is there any assurance that the turnaround efforts will be successful 
critical accounting policy judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and judgments which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  data i o evaluates our estimates  including those related to sales returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring charges  contingencies such as litigation  and contract terms that have multiple elements and other complexities typical in the telecommunications equipment industry 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
data i o believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition sales of our semiconductor programming equipment products requiring installation by us that is other than perfunctory are recorded when installation is complete  or at the later of customer acceptance or installation  if an acceptance clause is specified in the sales terms 
we recognize revenue from other product sales at the time of shipment 
we record revenue from the sale of service and update contracts as deferred revenue and we recognize it on a straight line basis over the contractual period  which is typically one year 
we establish a reserve for sales returns based on historical trends in product returns and estimates for new items 
if the actual future returns differ from historical levels  our revenue could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts we base the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected 
inventory provisions we base inventory purchases and commitments upon future demand forecasts and historic usage 
if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  data i o may be required to increase our inventory provision adjustments and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
warranty accruals data i o accrues for warranty costs based on the expected material and labor costs to fulfill our warranty obligations 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims  which are higher than our historical experience  our gross margin could be adversely affected 
results of continuing operations net sales in thousands net sales by product line change change non automated programming systems    automated programming systems    totals    net sales by location united states    of total international    of total vs 
data i o sales declined for the year compared to however  for the third and fourth quarters of  sales increased over the same quarters in the overall decline is attributed to the continued economic downturn  especially in capital spending 
sales declined in all product categories  but the declines were offset in part by increased sales from our proline roadrunner and new flashpak product lines 
sales declined in both in the us and international markets with the americas and europe declining the most 
we see a continuing trend in migration of customers moving manufacturing operations to low cost geographies  thereby increasing international sales opportunities 
the weakened us dollar  especially compared to the euro  is expected to assist in export sales as foreign currencies have more buying power 
we are continuing our connected strategy and transition to a common programming architecture  which resulted in the new flashpak and ps flashcore 
in  we also introduced proline infinity  proline roadrunner variable capacity options  tf tray feeder system  and high insertion socket adapters 
we expect these products to increase revenues  however  partially offsetting this is the trend of declining sales of our older product lines 
subsequent to year end  ice technology  who licensed our distribution of a low cost programmer line  ceased business 
in  sales related to these products were approximately  we are attempting to sell off our remaining inventory and are offering our other programmers as substitute products 
vs 
data i o experienced a decline in revenues in each of the last three quarters of versus the decline was a significant reduction in orders for both our automated and non automated programming equipment 
we believe this to be due to the general economic slowing in the wireless communications industry  among contract manufacturers and in other sectors of the electronics industry 
we experienced a decline in revenues in both the us and international markets 
gross margin in thousands change change gross margin    percentage of net sales vs 
gross margin decreased in dollars due primarily to the decline in sales volume 
gross margin increased as a percentage of sales primarily due to the savings from the restructuring and implementation of cost reductions  as well as lower inventory reserve and warranty charges 
the product mix shift towards additional proline roadrunner and related aftermarket products also improved the gross margin as a percentage of sales 
the restructuring efforts lowered our breakeven point by bringing cost and operation expenditures  primarily personnel reductions  in line with the revenue levels we are experiencing 
we expect these efforts and cost reductions  combined with the expected stability or growth in revenues  to result in improved gross margin percentages over what have been experienced during the past three years 
vs 
gross margins decreased sharply from to data i o experienced a decrease in both gross margin dollars and gross margin percentage 
the drop in gross margin dollars was roughly in proportion to the decline in revenue dollars 
by implementing cost reductions and three restructuring activities during  data i o limited the reduction in gross margin percentage to 
research and development in thousands change change research and development    percentage of net sales vs 
research and development r d spending for as compared to declined both in dollars and as a percentage of sales 
this was due primarily to the lower headcount related to our restructuring actions over the past two years 
during  data i o s r d focused on the new flashpak gang programming system and ps flashcore automated programming system which integrated the programming architecture first introduced in the proline roadrunner 
we also released the following new products proline infinity  a proline roadrunner utilizing an automated handler  proline roadrunner variable capacity options  tf tray feeder system  and high insertion socket adapters 
vs 
while reducing the r d expenditures by nearly million from the prior year  r d spending increased as a percentage of net sales by 
significant spending reductions occurred in salaries and benefits as a result of the restructuring and cost control efforts 
we believe it is essential to invest in r d to significantly enhance our existing products and to create new products as markets develop and technologies change 
we are focusing our r d efforts in our strategic growth markets  namely new programming technology and automated programming systems for the manufacturing environment  particularly extending the capabilities and support for our flashcore architecture and versions of the proline roadrunner 
selling  general and administrative in thousands change change selling  general and administrative    percentage of net sales vs 
selling  general and administrative sg a spending decreased by million in versus the prior year due primarily to the restructuring actions 
we reduced our expense by lowering our bad debts reserve due to collection of accounts receivable  incurring less retirement plan costs and lower commissions  partially offsetting these reductions were higher rent and insurance costs 
vs 
sg a spending decreased by  in versus the prior year due primarily to the restructuring actions and reduced marketing expenses 
we increased our direct sales force and decreased our dependence on outside sales rep firms to sell our products 
interest in thousands change change interest income interest expense vs 
interest income for decreased as compared to primarily due to the reduction in interest rates that occurred during and vs 
interest income for decreased as compared to primarily due to the reduction in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as the reduction in interest rates  which occurred during income taxes in thousands income tax expense benefit vs 
and vs 
income tax expense in all years relates entirely to foreign income taxes 
for financial reporting purposes  data i o established tax valuation reserves against our deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty relating to the realization of such asset values 
we had valuation allowances of million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates sales and expenses incurred by foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the subsidiary s local currency and translated into us dollar amounts at average rates of exchange during the year 
we recognized foreign currency transaction losses of  and  in and respectively 
the transaction losses resulted primarily from sales by our german subsidiary to our main customers  which were invoiced in us dollars 
we hedge our foreign currency exposure on sales of inventory and certain loans to our foreign subsidiaries through the use of foreign exchange contracts 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources in thousands change change working capital      in  cash and marketable securities declined by  comprising a portion of the working capital used to fund our loss in inventories decreased by million primarily due to lower sales volumes  aggressive measures undertaken during the year to reduce inventory levels  and reduced incoming purchased components and the implementation of lean manufacturing techniques 
accounts receivable decreased by million due to increased collection efforts and settlement of a former distributor receivable 
the decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses reflect the reduced volume of business and lower monthly operating costs from the restructure 
we estimate that capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment during will be between  and million 
although we expect that such expenditures will be made  we had no significant outstanding purchase commitments at december  such expenditures are expected to be funded from existing and internally generated funds or may be leased 
we established a foreign line of credit for  euros in february as a result of our significant product development  customer support  and selling and marketing efforts  data i o has required substantial working capital to fund our operations 
we restructured our operations to lower our costs and operating expenditures to lower our breakeven point  preserve our cash position and return to profitable operations 
we believe that we have sufficient working capital available under our operating plan to fund our operations and capital requirements through at least december  any substantial inability to achieve the current business plan could have a material adverse impact on our financial position  liquidity  or results of operations and may require us to reduce expenditures and or seek additional financing to enable us to continue operations through december  commitments data i o has commitments under non cancelable operating leases and other agreements  primarily for factory and office space  with initial or remaining terms of one year or more are as follows for the year ending december in thousands total  share repurchase program under a previously announced share repurchase program  data i o is authorized to repurchase up to  shares approximately of our outstanding common stock 
we may execute these purchases through open market purchases at prevailing market prices  through block purchases or in privately negotiated transactions  and we may commence or discontinue at any time 
as of december   data i o has repurchased  shares under this repurchase program at a total cost of approximately million 
data i o has not repurchased shares under this plan since the second quarter of although it still has the authority to do so 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement  accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
this statement requires entities to record a liability for the estimated retirement and removal costs of assets used in their business 
the liability should be recorded at its fair value  with a corresponding asset that should be depreciated over the remaining useful life of the long lived asset to which the liability relates 
period expenses will also be recognized for changes in the original value of the liability as a result of the passage of time and revisions in the undiscounted cash flows required to satisfy the obligation 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  data i o is currently assessing and quantifying the asset retirement obligations associated with our long lived assets and estimates that the impact on future annual net income will not be material due to the long period over which the costs will be depreciated 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  on april  statement no 
rescinds statement no  which required all gains and losses from extinguishments of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
upon adoption of statement no 
 companies will be required to apply the criteria in apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations  reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions in determining the classification of gains and losses resulting from the extinguishments of debt 
statement no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  while we have no current debt outstanding  we are evaluating the requirements and impact of this statement on our operations and financial position 
in june  the fasb issued statement  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires entities to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when liabilities are incurred rather than when the entity commits to an exit or disposal plan  as currently required 
examples of costs covered by this guidance include one time employee termination benefits  costs to terminate contracts other than capital leases  costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees  and certain other exit or disposal activities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and will impact any exit or disposal activities we initiate after that date 
in december  the fasb issued statement sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement sfas  to provide alternative transition methods for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in annual financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the pro forma effect on reported results of applying the fair value based method for entities that use the intrinsic value method of accounting 
the pro forma effect disclosures are also required to be prominently disclosed in interim period financial statements 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  and is effective for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december   with earlier application permitted 
we do not plan a change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and have included the disclosure requirements of sfas in the accompanying financial statements 
in november  fasb interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  was issued 
fin requires a guarantor entity  at the inception of a guarantee covered by the measurement provisions of the interpretation  to record a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
data i o previously did not record a liability when guaranteeing obligations unless it became probable that we would have to perform under the guarantee 
fin applies prospectively to guarantees we issue or modify subsequent to december   but has certain disclosure requirements effective for interim and annual periods ending after december  data i o has historically issued guarantees only on a limited basis and does not anticipate fin will have a material effect on our financial statements 
disclosures required by fin are included in the accompanying financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus opinion on eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the consensus provides that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met 
the consideration for the arrangement should be allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with different provisions if the fair value of all deliverables are not known or if the fair value is contingent on delivery of specified items or performance conditions 
applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for each separate unit of accounting 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  entities may elect to report the change as a cumulative effect adjustment in accordance with apb opinion  accounting changes 
data i o has not determined the effect of adoption of eitf on our financial statements or the method of adoption it will use 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk with respect to our foreign currency exchange rate risk  we currently use only foreign currency hedge derivative instruments  which  at a given date  are not material 
however  data i o is exposed to interest rate risks 
we generally invest in high grade commercial paper with original maturity dates of twelve months or less and conservative money market funds to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk on our marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale as of december  and december  we believe that the market risk arising from holdings of these financial instruments is not material
