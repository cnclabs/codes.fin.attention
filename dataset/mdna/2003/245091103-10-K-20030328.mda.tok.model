item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discussion of critical accounting policies the company makes estimates and assumptions in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and which require management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more critical accounting policies employed by the company 
revenue recognition the company sells its products to chain drug stores  mass volume retailers  supermarkets  wholesalers and overseas distributors 
sales of such products are denominated in us dollars and sales in canada are denominated in canadian dollars 
the company s accounts receivable reflect the granting of credit to these customers 
the company generally grants credit based upon analysis of the customer s financial position and previously established buying and selling patterns 
the company does not bill customers for shipping and handling costs and  accordingly  classifies such costs as selling and administrative expense 
revenues are recognized and discounts are recorded when merchandise is shipped 
net sales are comprised of gross revenues less returns  various promotional allowances and trade discounts and allowances 
the company allows customers to return their unsold products when they meet certain criteria as outlined in the company s sales policies 
the company regularly reviews and revises  as deemed necessary  its estimates of reserves for future sales returns based primarily upon actual return rates by product and planned product discontinuances 
the company records estimated reserves for future sales returns as a reduction of sales  cost of sales and accounts receivable 
returned products which are recorded as inventories are valued based on estimated realizable value 
the physical condition and marketability of the returned products are the major factors considered by the company in estimating realizable value 
actual returns  as well as estimated realizable values of returned products  may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from estimates if factors such as economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
effective january  the company adopted emerging issues task force eitf issue no

eitf issue no 
codified and reconciled the following eitf issues eitf issue no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives and eitf issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf issue no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives requires that sales incentives offered voluntarily by a vendor  without charge  to customers that can be used in  or that are exercisable by a customer as a result of  a single exchange transaction be recorded as a reduction from revenue 
eitf issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products requires that unless specific criteria are met  consideration from a vendor to a retailer be recorded as a reduction from revenue  as opposed to a selling expense 
as a result of the implementation of eitf issue no 
and eitf issue no 
 costs of   and  were recorded as a reduction of net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in and  these costs were included in selling and administrative expenses and have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation 
co operative advertising and promotional allowances the company has various performance based arrangements with retailers to reimburse them for all or a portion of their promotional activities related to the company s products 
these arrangements primarily allow customers to take deductions against amounts owed to the company for product purchases 
estimated accruals for promotions and co operative advertising programs are recorded at the later of the period in which the related revenue is recognized or when the sales incentive is granted 
the company regularly reviews and revises the estimated accruals for the projected costs for these promotions 
actual costs incurred by the company may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from estimates if factors such as the level and success of the retailers programs or other conditions differ from our expectations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
the company records a reduction to the cost of inventories based upon its forecasted plans to sell  historical scrap and disposal rates and the physical condition of the inventories 
these reductions are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  the timing of new product introductions  customer inventory levels  fashion oriented color cosmetic trends or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets property  plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful lives or the lease term 
changes in circumstances  such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model or changes in the company s capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of property  plant and equipment should be shortened  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value  over its revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  fixtures  software or planned closing of facilities could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets  other than goodwill  are reviewed by the company for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
the company s estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  the company would recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill must be tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level 
the company s reporting units are its cosmetic and pharmaceutical segments 
if an indication of impairment exists  the company is required to determine if such reporting unit s implied fair value is less than its carrying value in order to determine the amount  if any  of the impairment loss required to be recorded 
pension benefits the company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all eligible employees 
several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines and in conjunction with its actuarial consultants 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the expense and liability related to these plans 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants
