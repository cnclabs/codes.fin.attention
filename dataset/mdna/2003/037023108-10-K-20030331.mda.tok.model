item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all dollar figures expressed herein are expressed in thousands  except share or per share amounts 
general the company s primary long term objective is to distribute consistent dividends supported by operating earnings 
the company considers its operating earnings operating earnings to be net income available to common stockholders as determined under gaap before gains and losses  changes in accounting pronouncements and statement of financial accounting standard sfas hedging adjustments 
operating earnings are primarily maintained by consistent credit performance on the company s investments and stability of the company s liability structure 
in  the company established a strong long term secured debt issuance platform through two collateralized debt obligation cdo offerings 
these transactions effectively match funded a significant part of the company s long term credit sensitive cmbs and reit portfolios at attractive terms 
in the company expects to redeploy capital raised from these transactions combined with additional equity capital raised from the company s strategic common stock issuance program 
this is expected to lead to the accretion of both earnings and book value per share as well as to increase diversification of credit exposure 
the company establishes its dividend by analyzing the long term sustainability of operating earnings given existing market conditions and the current composition of its portfolio 
this includes an analysis of the company s credit loss assumptions  general level of interest rates  realized gains and losses and projected hedging costs 
these factors are generally beyond the company s control so there is no certainty that dividends will remain at current levels 
during calendar year  the company distributed per share in the form of fully taxable dividends on a quarterly basis 
for the year ended december   the company recorded of gaap earnings per share and of operating earnings per share

commercial real estate securities include cmbs and investment grade reit debt 
during the year ended december   the company increased total assets in this sector by from  to  this increase was attributable to the execution of the two cdo offerings that provided an attractive match funding financing platform for these assets

the total market value of the assets contributed to the two cdos at december  was  an additional  of par can be contributed through the ramp facility 
securities contributed at a discounted market value would generate excess cash in the amount of the discount 
the company did not sell  of par of cdo ii debt rated bbb and bb assets contributed to the cdos were a combination of below investment grade cmbs rated below bbb  investment grade cmbs rated bbb to bb and investment grade unsecured reit debt 
cmbs securities rated b or lower were not contributed into either cdo 
the company did not contribute certain other below investment grade cmbs rated bb down to b 
other securities that were not contributed to either cdo include a portfolio of aaa rated cmbs io securities and other cmbs related securities 
the following table details the par  fair market value  adjusted purchase price and loss adjusted yield of the company s commercial real estate securities outside of the cdos as of december  fair market adjusted dollar loss adjusted par value dollar price purchase price price yield cmbs rated bb to b    cmbs rated b or lower    cmbs ios    other cmbs    total    below investment grade cmbs and underlying loan performance the company divides its below investment grade cmbs investment activity into two portfolios  controlling class cmbs and other below investment grade cmbs 
the distinction between the two is in the controlling class rights 
controlling class rights allow the company to control the workout and or disposition of defaults that occur in the underlying loans 
these securities absorb the first losses realized in the underlying loan pools 
other below investment grade cmbs have no right to control the workout and or disposition of underlying loan defaults  however they are not the first to absorb losses in the underlying pools 
during  the company acquired  of par of other below investment grade cmbs and did not acquire any new controlling class securities 
the company continues to take a cautious approach to the real estate credit markets and favored cmbs with greater credit protection rather than being in a first loss position 
the total par of the company s other below investment grade cmbs at december  was  the total credit protection  or subordination level  of this portfolio is 
the total par of the company s controlling class cmbs at december  was  and the total par of the loans underlying these securities was  the non rated security is the first to absorb underlying loan losses until its par is completely written off 
the coupon payment on the non rated security can also be reduced for special servicer fees charged to the trust 
the next highest rated security in the structure will then generally be downgraded to non rated and becomes the first to absorb losses and expenses from that point on 
the company s investment in its controlling class cmbs by credit rating category at december  is as follows adjusted fair market dollar purchase dollar subordination par value price price price level bb    bb    bb    b    b    b    ccc    nr    n a total    the company s investment in its controlling class cmbs by credit rating category at december  is as follows adjusted fair market dollar purchase dollar subordination par value price price price level bb    bb    bb    b    b    b    ccc    nr    n a total    during  the par for one of the company s controlling class cmbs was written down by the servicer in the amount of  this reduction in par does not affect the company s loss adjusted yield on this asset 
during the year ended certain delinquent loans in cmac c caused a temporary shortfall of interest available to pay the non rated security which shortfall may not be recoverable 
the company expects the coupon to resume during the first half of these types of shortfalls are expected to occur in non rated cmbs classes and therefore the company currently does not believe this is an impairment that requires a change in loss assumptions 
further delinquencies and losses may cause the shortfall to continue and cause the company to conclude that a change in loss adjusted yield is required along with a significant write down of the adjusted purchase price through the income statement according to eitf also during  the loan pools were paid down by  pay down proceeds are distributed to the highest rated cmbs class first and reduce the percent of total underlying collateral represented by each rating category 
for all of the company s controlling class securities  the company assumes that of the remaining current aggregate loan balance will not be recoverable 
this has not changed from the year ended this estimate was developed based on an analysis of individual loan characteristics and prevailing market conditions at the time of origination 
this loss estimate equates to cumulative expected defaults of approximately over the life of the portfolio and an average assumed loss severity of of the defaulted loan balance 
all estimated workout expenses including special servicer fees are included in these assumptions 
actual results could differ materially from these estimated results 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of how differences between estimated and actual losses could affect company earnings 
the company monitors credit performance on a monthly basis and debt service coverage ratios on a quarterly basis 
using these and other statistics  the company maintains watch lists for loans that are delinquent thirty days or more and for loans that are not delinquent but have issues that the company feels require close monitoring 
the company plans to perform a detailed re underwriting of a substantial number of the underlying loans supporting its controlling class cmbs within the next months 
upon completion  the company may determine that its gaap yields and book values need to be adjusted 
the company considers delinquency information from the lehman brothers conduit guide to be the most relevant measure of credit performance and market conditions applicable to its controlling class cmbs holdings 
the year of issuance  or vintage year  is important  as older loan pools will tend to have more delinquencies than newly underwritten loans 
the company owns controlling class cmbs issued in  and comparable delinquency statistics referenced by vintage year as a percentage of par outstanding as of december  are shown in the table below underlying delinquencies lehman conduit vintage year collateral outstanding guide total  weighted average based on respective collateral morgan stanley also tracks cmbs loan delinquencies for the specific cmbs transactions with more than  of collateral and that have been seasoned for at least one year 
this seasoning criterion will generally adjust for the lower delinquencies that occur in newly originated collateral 
as of december   the morgan stanley index indicated that delinquencies on securitizations was  and as of december   this same index indicated that delinquencies on securitizations was 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks for a detailed discussion of how delinquencies and loan losses affect the company 
delinquencies on the company s cmbs collateral as a percent of principal increased in line with expectations 
the company s aggregate delinquency experience is consistent with comparable data provided in the lehman brothers conduit guide 
of the delinquent loans shown on the chart in note of the consolidated financial statements  one was delinquent due to technical reasons  six were real estate owned reo and being marketed for sale  three were in foreclosure  and the remaining loans were in some form of workout negotiations 
aggregate realized losses of  were realized in the fourth quarter of this brings cumulative net losses realized to  which is of total estimated losses 
these losses include special servicer and other workout expenses 
this experience to date is in line with the company s loss expectations 
realized losses are expected to increase on the underlying loans as the portfolio ages 
special servicer expenses are also expected to increase as portfolios mature and us economic activity remains weak 
the company manages its credit risk through disciplined underwriting  diversification  active monitoring of loan performance and exercise of its right to control the workout process as early as possible 
the company maintains diversification of credit exposures through its underwriting process and can shift its focus in future investments by adjusting the mix of loans in subsequent acquisitions 
the comparative profiles of the loans underlying the company s cmbs by property type as of december  and for the two prior years is as follows exposure exposure exposure property type loan balance of total loan balance of total loan balance of total multifamily    retail    office    lodging    industrial    healthcare    parking    total    as of december   the fair market value of the company s holdings of cmbs is  lower than the adjusted cost for these securities 
except for the writedown of the fmact bond  this decline in the value of the investment portfolio represents market valuation changes and is not due to actual credit experience or credit expectations 
the adjusted purchase price of the company s controlling class cmbs portfolio as of december  represents approximately of its par amount 
the market value of the company s controlling class cmbs portfolio as of december  represents approximately of its par amount 
as the portfolio matures  the company expects to recoup the unrealized loss  provided that the credit losses experienced are not greater than the credit losses assumed in the purchase analysis 
as of december   the company believes there has been no material deterioration in the credit quality of its portfolio below original expectations 
as the portfolio matures and expected losses occur  subordination levels of the lower rated classes of a cmbs investment will be reduced 
this may cause the lower rated classes to be downgraded which would negatively affect their market value and therefore the company s net asset value 
reduced market value will negatively affect the company s ability to finance any such securities that are not financed through a cdo or similar matched funding vehicle 
in some cases  securities held by the company may be upgraded to reflect seasoning of the underlying collateral and thus would increase the market value of the securities 
the company s gaap income for its cmbs securities is computed based upon a yield which assumes credit losses would occur 
the yield to compute the company s taxable income does not assume there would be credit losses  as a loss can only be deducted for tax purposes when it has occurred 
as a result  for the years through december   the company s gaap income accrued on its cmbs assets was approximately  lower than the taxable income accrued on the cmbs assets 
the fmact ba class b security continues to perform poorly 
based on the information provided by the trustee  as of december   of the borrowers in the loan pool underlying this security  there are borrowers with loans in the amount of  which are in default  borrowers with loans in the amount of  which are delinquent  and borrowers with loans in the amount of  which are current 
during the fourth quarter of  the servicer of the underlying loans recouped principal and interest advances made in prior years 
this action resulted  at least temporarily  in insufficient cash being available to make the payments required on the company s class b security 
based on the delinquencies and defaults in the underlying pools  and the missed payments during the fourth quarter of as described above  the company revised its estimated future cash flows from this investment 
accordingly  in accordance with eitf  the company determined that its investment was impaired and wrote down the adjusted purchase price of this security by  to its estimated fair value and increased the gaap yield from to a market yield for a security of this credit quality  estimated to be 
these figures incorporate the assumption that an additional  of losses will be experienced by the underlying pools and an estimate of another of losses per year over the remaining life of the trust 
this security was part of the core cap acquisition in may of and was rated aa at that time 
this security is currently rated d by standard poors and cc by fitch ratings 
commercial real estate loan activity the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio generally emphasizes larger transactions located in metropolitan markets  as compared to the typical loan in the cmbs portfolio 
there are no delinquencies in the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio which is relatively small and heterogeneous 
the company has determined it is not necessary to establish a loan loss reserve 
the following table summarizes the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio by property type as of december   and loan outstanding weighted average december  december  december  coupon property type amount amount amount office    multifamily    retail  hotel   total    recent events included in cdo ii was a ramp facility that will be utilized to fund the purchase of  of par of below investment grade cmbs 
on march   the company purchased  par of securities in csfb cpn of this purchase   par will be contributed into the ramp facility for cdo ii  and  will be held outside of cdo ii 
on march   the unaffiliated directors approved an extension of the management agreement from its expiration of march  for one year through march  the terms of the renewed agreement are similar to the prior agreement except for the incentive fee calculation which would provide for a rolling four quarter high watermark rather than a quarterly calculation 
in determining the rolling four quarter high watermark  the company would calculate the incentive fee based upon the current and prior three quarters net income 
the manager would be paid an incentive fee in the current quarter if the yearly incentive fee is greater than what was paid to the manager in the prior three quarters cumulatively 
the company will phase in the rolling four quarter high watermark commencing with the second quarter of calculation of the incentive fee will be based on gaap and adjusted to exclude special one time events pursuant to changes in gaap accounting pronouncements after discussion between the manager and the unaffiliated directors 
the incentive fee threshold did not change 
the high watermark will be based on the existing incentive fee hurdle  which provides for the manager to be paid of the amount of earnings calculated in accordance with gaap per share that exceeds the product of the adjusted issue price of the company s common stock per share as of december  and the greater of or basis points over the ten year treasury note 
on february   the company funded a capital call notice from carbon in the amount of  this was used by carbon to acquire a mezzanine loan secured by ownership interests in an entity that owns a mixed use development 
in january  the par for two of the company s controlling class cmbs was written down by the servicer in the aggregate amount of  this reduction in par does not affect the company s loss adjusted yield on this asset 
in january  the company s  financing facility with merrill lynch mortgage capital  inc expired pursuant to its terms 
there was no balance owing at the expiration 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of the company s accounting policies that are the most affected by management judgments  estimates and assumptions securities available for sale the company has designated its investments in mortgage backed securities  mortgage related securities and certain other securities as available for sale 
securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
many of these investments are relatively illiquid  and their values must be estimated by management 
in making these estimates  management generally utilizes market prices provided by dealers who make markets in these securities  but may  under certain circumstances  adjust these valuations based on management s judgment 
changes in the valuations do not affect the company s reported income or cash flows  but impact stockholders equity and  accordingly  book value per share 
management must also assess whether unrealized losses on securities reflect a decline in value which is other than temporary  and  accordingly  write the impaired security down to its fair value  through earnings 
significant judgment of management is required in this analysis which includes but is not limited to making assumptions regarding the collectibility of the principal and interest  net of related expenses  on the underlying loans 
income on these securities is recognized based upon a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies 
examples of these include  among other things  the rate and timing of principal payments including prepayments  repurchases  defaults and liquidations  the pass through or coupon rate and interest rate fluctuations 
additional factors that may affect the company s reported interest income on its mortgage securities include interest payment shortfalls due to delinquencies on the underlying mortgage loans  and the timing and magnitude of credit losses on the mortgage loans underlying the securities that are a result of the general condition of the real estate market including competition for tenants and their related credit quality and changes in market rental rates 
these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events which may alter the assumptions 
the company adopted eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets on april  the company recognizes interest income from its purchased beneficial interests in securitized financial interests beneficial interests other than beneficial interests of high credit quality  sufficiently collateralized to ensure that the possibility of credit loss is remote  or that cannot contractually be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the company would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment in accordance with this guidance 
accordingly  on a quarterly basis  when significant changes in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience  the company calculates a revised yield based on the current amortized cost of the investment including any other than temporary impairments recognized to date and the revised cash flows 
the revised yield is then applied prospectively to recognize interest income 
prior to april   the company recognized income from these beneficial interests using the effective interest method  based on an anticipated yield over the projected life of the security 
changes in the anticipated yields were calculated due to revisions in the company s estimates of future and actual credit losses and prepayments 
changes in anticipated yields resulting from credit loss and prepayment revisions were recognized through a cumulative catch up adjustment at the date of the change which reflected the change in income from the security from the date of purchase through the date of change in the anticipated yield 
the new yield was then used prospectively to account for interest income 
changes in yields from reduced estimates of losses were recognized prospectively 
for other mortgage backed and related mortgage securities  the company accounts for interest income under sfas  using the effective yield method which includes the amortization of discount or premium arising at the time of purchase and the stated or coupon interest payments 
as a result of the pending closing of cdo i  at the end of the first quarter the company reclassified all of its subordinated cmbs on the balance sheet from available for sale to held to maturity 
the effect of this reclassification changed the accounting basis of these securities  prospectively  from mark to market to adjusted cost 
however  in accordance with sfas  the interest rate swap agreements entered into by the company to hedge the variable rate exposure of the debt of cdo i are required to be presented on the balance sheet at their fair market value 
accordingly  the company has determined that at december   and going forward  it will classify all of its subordinated cmbs as available for sale securities and record them at fair market value 
this is consistent with the mark to market requirement for the cdo s interest rate swap agreements 
the reclassification of these securities to available for sale from held to maturity increased the recorded value of these securities from  to  with the difference being recorded in other comprehensive income 
the circumstance causing the company to change this classification was not considered a permitted circumstance as stated in statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and is therefore inconsistent with the company s intent regarding its held to maturity classification 
accordingly  the company will be prohibited from classifying its subordinated cmbs current holdings as well as future purchases as held to maturity for a period of two years 
securities held for trading the company has designated certain other securities as held for trading 
securities held for trading are also carried at estimated fair value  but changes in fair value are included in income 
the valuations of these securities and the interest income recognized are subject to the same uncertainties as those discussed above 
mortgage loans the company purchases and originates commercial mortgage loans to be held as long term investments 
the company also has an investment in a private opportunity fund which invests in commercial mortgage loans and is managed by the manager 
management must periodically evaluate each of these loans for possible impairment 
impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
if a loan is determined to be impaired  the company would establish a reserve for probable losses and a corresponding charge to earnings 
given the nature of the company s loan portfolio and the underlying commercial real estate collateral  significant judgment of management is required in determining impairment and the resulting loss allowance which includes but is not limited to making assumptions regarding the value of the real estate which secures the mortgage loan 
to date  the company has determined that no loss allowances have been necessary on the loans in its portfolio or held by the opportunity fund 
real estate joint ventures the company makes investments in real estate entities over which the company exercises significant influence  but not control 
the real estate held by such entities must be regularly reviewed for impairment  and would be written down to its estimated fair value  through earnings  if impairment is determined to exist 
this review involves assumptions about the future operating results of the real estate and market factors  all of which are subjective and difficult to predict 
to date  the company has determined that none of the real estate held by its joint ventures is impaired 
derivative instruments the company utilizes various hedging instruments derivatives to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposures or to modify the interest rate or foreign currency characteristics of related company investments 
all derivatives are carried at fair value  generally estimated by management based on valuations provided by the counterparty to the derivative contract 
for accounting purposes  the company s management must decide whether to designate these derivatives as hedging borrowings  securities available for sale  securities held for trading or foreign currency exposure 
this designation decision affects the manner in which the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reported 
deferred financing the deferred financing cost which is included in other assets on the company s consolidated statements of financial condition include issuance costs related to the company s debt and are amortized using the straight line method which method is similar to the results of the effective interest method 
impairment securities in accordance with sfas  when the estimated fair value of the security classified as available for sale has been below amortized cost for a significant period of time and the company concludes that it no longer has the ability or intent to hold the security for the period of time over which the company expects the values to recover to amortized cost  the investment is written down to its fair value 
the resulting charge is included in income  and a new cost basis established 
additionally  under eitf  when significant changes in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience  and the present value of the revised cash flows using the current expected yield is less than the present value of the previously estimated remaining cash flows adjusted for cash receipts during the intervening period  an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred 
accordingly  the security is written down to fair value with the resulting change being included in income  and a new cost basis established 
in both instances  the original discount or premium is written off when the new cost basis is established 
after taking into account the effect of the impairment charge  income is recognized under eitf or sfas  as applicable  using the market yield for the security used in establishing the write down 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these standards change the accounting for business combinations by  among other things  prohibiting the prospective use of pooling of interests accounting and requiring companies to stop amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
instead  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives will be subject to an annual review for impairment 
the new standards were effective for the company in the first quarter of upon adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of  the company recorded a one time  noncash adjustment of approximately  to write off the unamortized balance of its negative goodwill 
such charge is non operational in nature and is reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
amortization of negative goodwill was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in august of  the fasb issued sfas no   accounting for asset retirement obligations effective january  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets effective january  
sfas no 
requires the recording of the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
sfas no 
supercedes existing accounting literature dealing with impairment and disposal of long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
it addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and expands current reporting for discontinued operations to include disposals of a component of an entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
the company has determined that these interpretations do not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
the disclosure provisions of this interpretation are effective for the company s december  consolidated financial statements 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company has determined that this interpretation does not currently impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
amends safs no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  the statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company has determined that this interpretation does not currently impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation clarifies the application of existing accounting pronouncements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions of the interpretation will be immediately effective for all variable interests in variable interest entities created after january  the company will need to apply this interpretation to any existing variable interests in variable interest entities by no later than july  the company is in the process of evaluating all of its investments and other interests in entities that may be deemed variable interest entities under the provisions of fin these include interests in commercial mortgage backed securities and their issuers that have issued securities with a total face value of  the company s actual loss is limited to the amounts that are not financed in its non recourse cdos 
the fair value of the securities financed in the cdos is  the amount held outside of the cdos is  the company s believes that many of these interests and entities will not be consolidated  and may not ultimately fall under the provisions of fin the company cannot make any definitive conclusion until it completes its evaluation

net interest margin and net interest spread from the portfolio the company considers its portfolio to consist of its securities available for sale  mortgage loan pools  commercial mortgage loans and cash and cash equivalents because these assets relate to its core strategy of acquiring and originating high yield loans and securities backed by commercial real estate  while at the same time maintaining a portfolio of investment grade securities to enhance the company s liquidity 
net interest margin from the portfolio is annualized net interest income from the portfolio divided by the average market value of interest earning assets in the portfolio 
net interest income from the portfolio is total interest income from the portfolio less interest expense relating to collateralized borrowings 
net interest spread from the portfolio equals the yield on average assets for the period less the average cost of funds for the period 
the yield on average assets is interest income from the portfolio divided by average amortized cost of interest earning assets in the portfolio 
the average cost of funds is interest expense from the portfolio divided by average outstanding collateralized borrowings 
the following chart describes the interest income  interest expense  net interest margin and net interest spread for the company s portfolio

tax basis income was  or diluted per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net income as calculated in accordance with gaap of  or diluted per share 
differences between tax basis net income and gaap net income arise for various reasons 
for example  in computing income from its subordinated cmbs for gaap purposes  the company takes into account estimated credit losses on the underlying loans  whereas for tax basis income purposes  only actual credit losses are taken into account 
certain general and administrative expenses may differ due to differing treatment of the deductibility of such expenses for tax basis income 
also  differences could arise in the treatment of premium and discount amortization on the company s securities available for sale 
changes in financial condition securities available for sale the company s securities available for sale  which are carried at estimated fair value  included the following at december  and december  december  december  estimated estimated fair fair security description value percentage value percentage commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs ios   investment grade cmbs   non investment grade rated subordinated securities   non rated subordinated securities   credit tenant lease  investment grade reit debt   total cmbs   single family residential mortgage backed securities agency adjustable rate securities   agency fixed rate securities   residential cmos   home equity loans  hybrid arms  total rmbs   total securities available for sale   the increase in the cmbs and reit debt is attributable to the attractive opportunities available to the company to match fund these assets in its two cdos

as of december   the company s debt consisted of line of credit borrowings  term loans and reverse repurchase agreements  collateralized by a pledge of most of the company s securities available for sale  securities held for trading and its commercial mortgage loans 
the company s financial flexibility is affected by its ability to renew or replace on a continuous basis its maturing short term borrowings 
as of december  and  the company has obtained financing in amounts and at interest rates consistent with the company s short term financing objectives 
under the lines of credit  term loans and the reverse repurchase agreements  the lender retains the right to mark the underlying collateral to market value 
a reduction in the value of its pledged assets would require the company to provide additional collateral or fund margin calls 
from time to time  the company expects that it will be required to provide such additional collateral or fund margin calls 
most of the company s reverse repurchase agreements are collateralized by highly liquid rmbs which can be readily liquidated

these financial instruments are intended to mitigate the effect of changes in interest rates on the value of certain assets in the company s portfolio 
at december   the company had outstanding short positions of  five year and  ten year us treasury note future contracts 
at december   the company had outstanding short positions of thirty year us treasury bond futures  ten year us treasury note future contracts and a short call swaption with a notional amount of  interest rate swap agreements as of december  and december  consisted of the following december  weighted national estimated unamortized average value fair value cost remaining term interest rate swaps   years interest rate swaps cdo   years total   years december  weighted national estimated unamortized average value fair value cost remaining term interest rate swaps    years as of december   the company had designated  notional of the interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges

capital resources and liquidity liquidity is a measurement of the company s ability to meet cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund investments  loan acquisition and lending activities and for other general business purposes 
the primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of collateralized borrowings  principal and interest payments on and maturities of securities available for sale  securities held for trading and commercial mortgage loans  and proceeds from the maturity or sales thereof 
the company finances itself with its own equity  follow on equity offerings  preferred stock offerings  secured term debt  committed financing facilities and reverse repurchase agreements 
an important part of the company s risk analysis includes a thorough assessment of the financing alternatives in the context of the assets being financed 
reverse repurchase agreements are secured loans generally with a term of days 
the interest rate is based on day libor plus a spread that is determined based on the asset pledged as security 
the terms include a daily mark to market provision that requires the posting of additional collateral if the value of the pledged asset declines 
after the day period expires  there is no obligation for the lender to extend credit for an additional period 
this type of financing is generally available only for more liquid securities 
the interest rate charged on reverse repurchase agreements is usually the lowest relative to the alternatives due to the greater risk inherent in these transactions 
committed financing facilities represent multi year agreements to provide secured financing for a specific asset class 
these facilities include a daily mark to market provision requiring posting of additional collateral if the value of the pledged asset declines 
a significant difference between committed financing facilities and reverse repurchase agreements is the term of the financing 
a committed facility provider is generally required to provide financing for the full term of the agreement  usually two to three years  rather than thirty days generally used in the reserve repurchase market 
this feature makes the financing of less liquid assets more viable 
issuance of secured term debt is generally done through a collateralized debt obligation offering 
this entails creating a special purpose entity that holds assets used to secure the cashflow payments required of the debt issued 
as this transaction is considered a financing  the spe is fully consolidated on the company s consolidated financial statements 
asset cashflows are generally matched with the debt cashflows over their respective lives and an interest rate swap is used to match the fixed or floating rate nature of the coupon payments where necessary 
this type of transaction is usually referred to as match funding or term financing 
there is no mark to market requirement in this structure and the debt cannot be called or terminated by the bondholders 
furthermore  the debt issued is non recourse to the issuer so permanent reductions in value do not affect the liquidity of the company 
however  since the company expects to earn a positive spread between the income generated by the assets and the expense of the debt issued  a permanent impairment of any of the assets would negatively affect the spread over time 
the company may issue preferred stock from time to time as a source of long term or permanent capital 
preferred stock generally has a fixed coupon and may have a fixed term in the form of a maturity date or other redemption or conversion feature 
the preferred stockholder typically has the right to a preferential distribution for dividends and any liquidity proceeds 
another source of permanent capital is the issuance of common stock through a follow on offering 
this allows investors to purchase a large block of common stock in one transaction 
a common stock issuance can be accretive to the company s per share book value if the issue price exceeds the book value of the company s assets 
it can also be accretive to earnings per share if the company deploys the new capital into assets that generate a risk adjusted return that exceeds the return of the company s existing assets 
furthermore  earnings accretion can be achieved at reinvestment rates that are lower than the return on existing assets if common stock can be issued at a premium to book value 
the company continuously evaluates the market for follow on common stock offerings as well as the available opportunities to deploy new capital on an accretive basis 
during  the company did not issue any common stock in follow on equity offerings 
in  the company issued  shares of common stock in two follow on offerings at an average price of per share 
contingent liability on may   the company completed the acquisition of core cap  inc the merger was a stock for stock acquisition where the company issued  shares of its common stock and  shares of its series b preferred stock 
at the time of the core cap acquisition  the manager agreed to pay gmac core cap  inc s external advisor  over a ten year period installment payment to purchase the right to manage the assets under the existing management contract gmac contract 
the gmac contract had to be terminated in order to allow for the company to complete the merger  as the company s management agreement with the manager did not provide for multiple managers 
as a result the manager offered to buy out the gmac contract as the manager estimated it would receive incremental fees above and beyond the installment payment  and thus was willing to pay for  and separately negotiate  the termination of the gmac contract 
accordingly  the value of the installment payment was not considered in the company s allocation of its purchase price to the net assets acquired in the acquisition of core cap  inc the company agreed that should the management agreement with its manager be terminated  not renewed or not extended for any reason other than for cause  the company would pay to the manager an amount equal to the installment payment less the sum of all payments made by the manager to gmac 
as of december   the installment payment would be  payable over eight years 
the company does not accrue for this contingent liability 
transactions with affiliates the company has a management agreement with the manager  a majority owned indirect subsidiary of the pnc financial services group  inc pnc bank and the employer of certain directors and officers of the company  under which the manager manages the company s day to day operations  subject to the direction and oversight of the company s board of directors 
the initial two year term of the management agreement was to expire on march   on march   the management agreement was extended for an additional two years  with the approval of the unaffiliated directors  on terms similar to the original agreement 
on march   the management agreement was extended for one year through march   with the approval of the unaffiliated directors  on terms similar to the prior agreement with the following changes i the incentive fee calculation would be based on gaap earnings instead of funds from operations  ii the removal of the four year period to value the management agreement in the event of termination and iii subsequent renewal periods of the management agreement would be for one year instead of two years 
the board was advised by houlihan lokey howard zukin financial advisors  inc  a national investment banking and financial advisory firm  in the renewal process 
on march   the unaffiliated directors approved an extension of the management agreement from its expiration of march  for one year through march  the terms of the renewed agreement are similar to the prior agreement except for the incentive fee calculation which would provide for a rolling four quarter high watermark rather than a quarterly calculation 
in determining the rolling four quarter high watermark  the company would calculate the incentive fee based upon the current and prior three quarters net income 
the manager would be paid an incentive fee in the current quarter if the yearly incentive fee is greater than what was paid to the manager in the prior three quarters cumulatively 
the company will phase in the rolling four quarter high watermark commencing with the second quarter of calculation of the incentive fee will be based on gaap and adjusted to exclude special one time events pursuant to changes in gaap accounting pronouncements after discussion between the manager and the unaffiliated directors 
the incentive fee threshold did not change 
the high watermark will be based on the existing incentive fee hurdle  which provides for the manager to be paid of the amount of earnings calculated in accordance with gaap per share that exceeds the product of the adjusted issue price of the company s common stock per share as of december  and the greater of or basis points over the ten year treasury note 
the company pays the manager an annual base management fee equal to a percentage of the average invested assets of the company as defined in the management agreement 
the base management fee is equal to per annum of the average invested assets rated less than bb or not rated  of average invested assets rated bb to bb  and of average invested assets rated above bb 
in order to coincide with the increased size of the company  effective july   the manager reduced the base management fee from of average invested assets rated above bb 
this revision resulted in  and  in savings to the company during and  respectively 
the company incurred   and  in base management fees in accordance with the terms of the management agreement for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in accordance with the provisions of the management agreement  the company recorded reimbursements to the manager of  and for certain expenses incurred on behalf of the company during  and  respectively 
the company has also paid the manager on a quarterly basis  as incentive compensation  an amount equal to of the funds from operations of the company as defined plus gains minus losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  before incentive compensation in excess of a threshold rate 
the threshold rate for  and the six months ended june  was based upon an annualized return on equity equal to over the ten year us treasury rate on the adjusted issue price of the common stock 
effective july   the manager revised the threshold rate to be the greater of over the ten year us treasury rate or 
this revision resulted in and in savings to the company during and  respectively 
pursuant to the march  one year management agreement extension  such incentive fee was based on of earnings calculated in accordance with gaap of the company 
for purposes of the incentive compensation calculation  equity is generally defined as proceeds from issuance of common stock before underwriting discounts and commissions and other costs of issuance 
for purposes of calculating the incentive fee during  the cumulative transition adjustment of  resulting from the company s adoption of sfas was excluded from earnings in its entirety and included using an amortization period of three years 
this revision saved the company  of incentive fee during the company incurred   and in incentive compensation for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on march   the company s board of directors approved an administration agreement with the manager and the termination of a previous agreement with an unaffiliated third party 
under the terms of the administration agreement  the manager provides financial reporting  audit coordination and accounting oversight services to the company 
the company pays the manager a monthly administrative fee at an annual rate of of the first million of average net assets  of the next million of average net assets and of average net assets in excess of million subject to a minimum annual fee of for the years ended december   and  the company paid administration fees of  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   the company purchased certificates representing a interest in midland commercial mortgage owner trust iv  midland commercial mortgage owner trust v  midland commercial mortgage owner trust vi  commercial mortgage owner trust vii  pnc loan trust vii and pnc loan trust viii collectively the trusts for an aggregate investment of  these midland trusts were purchased from midland loan services  inc midland and the pnc trusts were purchased from pnc bank 
midland is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of pnc bank and the depositor to the trusts 
the assets of these trusts consist of commercial mortgage loans originated or acquired by midland and pnc bank 
in connection with these transactions  the company entered into a  committed line of credit from pnc funding corp  a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of pnc bank  to borrow up to of the fair market value of the company s interest in the trusts 
outstanding borrowings against this line of credit bear interest at a libor based variable rate 
as of december  and there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit 
the company earned and from the trusts and paid interest of approximately and to pnc funding corp

the midland trusts were all sold prior to december  the gain on sale of these investments was not significant 
in march  the company purchased twelve certificates each representing a interest in different classes of owner trust ns i trust owner trusts for an aggregate investment of  these certificates were purchased from pnc bank 
the assets of the owner trusts consist of commercial mortgage loans originated or acquired by an affiliate of pnc bank 
the company entered into a  committed line of credit from pnc funding corp

as interest on borrowings under a related line of credit for year ended december  during  the company sold four owner trusts 
the gain on the sale of those owner trusts was the outstanding borrowings were repaid prior to the expiration of the line of credit on march   at which time the remaining owner trusts were sold at a gain of on july   the company entered into a million commitment to acquire shares in carbon 
the period during which the company may be required to purchase shares under the commitment  expires in july on november   the company received a capital call notice to fund  of its carbon investment  which was paid on november  on october   the company funded an additional capital call notice in the amount of  the proceeds of the capital calls were primarily used by carbon to acquire commercial loans secured by real estate or ownership interests in entities that own real estate 
on december   the company owned of the outstanding shares in carbon 
in march  carbon obtained additional commitments from unaffiliated institutional investors while the company s commitment remained unchanged 
accordingly  the company s ownership was reduced from to 
on december   the company received dividends from its investment of  the company s remaining commitment at december  and was  and  respectively 
on february   the company funded an additional capital call notice in the amount of  which was used by carbon to acquire a mezzanine loan secured by ownership interests in an entity that owns a mixed use development 
reit status the company has elected to be taxed as a reit and therefore must comply with the provisions of the code with respect thereto 
accordingly  the company generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent of its distributions to stockholders and as long as certain asset  income and stock ownership tests are met 
the company may  however  be subject to tax at corporate rates or at excise tax rates on net income or capital gains not distributed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit curve spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rate risk and credit curve risk 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
credit risk is highly sensitive to dynamics of the markets for commercial mortgage securities and other loans and securities held by the company 
excessive supply of these assets combined with reduced demand will cause the market to require a higher yield 
this demand for higher yield will cause the market to use a higher spread over the us treasury securities yield curve  or other benchmark interest rates  to value these assets 
changes in the general level of the us treasury yield curve can have significant effects on the market value of the company s portfolio 
the majority of the company s assets are fixed rate securities valued based on a market credit spread to us treasuries 
as us treasury securities are priced to a higher yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is increased  the market value of the company s portfolio may decline 
conversely  as us treasury securities are priced to a lower yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is decreased  the market value of the company s portfolio may increase 
changes in the market value of the company s portfolio may affect the company s net income or cash flow directly through their impact on unrealized gains or losses on securities held for trading or indirectly through their impact on the company s ability to borrow 
changes in the level of the us treasury yield curve can also affect  among other things  the prepayment assumptions used to value certain of the company s securities and the company s ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
in addition  changes in the general level of the libor money market rates can affect the company s net interest income 
the majority of the company s liabilities are floating rate based on a market spread to us libor 
as the level of libor increases or decreases  the company s interest expense will move in the same direction 
the company may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on its operations 
the use of these types of derivatives to hedge interest earning assets and or interest bearing liabilities carries certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and  that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
a hedge may not perform its intended purpose of offsetting losses or increased costs 
moreover  with respect to certain of the instruments used as hedges  the company is exposed to the risk that the counterparties with which the company trades may cease making markets and quoting prices in such instruments  which may render the company unable to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to an open position 
if the company anticipates that the income from any such hedging transaction will not be qualifying income for reit income test purposes  the company may conduct part or all of its hedging activities through a to be formed corporate subsidiary that is fully subject to federal corporate income taxation 
the profitability of the company may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following tables quantify the potential changes in the company s net portfolio value and net interest income under various interest rates and credit spread scenarios 
the company views the probability of interest rate changes in terms of standard deviation units 
based on historical data  there is a and statistical probability that rates remained in a range of one and two standard deviation units  respectively 
this statistical computation provides an historical context for analyzing changes in interest rates 
net portfolio value is defined as the value of interest earning assets net of the value of interest bearing liabilities 
it is evaluated using an assumption that interest rates  as defined by the us treasury yield curve  increase or decrease and the assumption that the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
one standard deviation of ten year treasury rates for calendar year was basis points 
net interest income is defined as interest income earned from interest earning assets net of the interest expense incurred by the interest bearing liabilities 
it is evaluated using the assumptions that interest rates  as defined by the us libor curve  increase or decrease and the assumption that the yield curves of the libor rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
market value in this scenario is calculated using the assumption that the us treasury yield curve remains constant 
one standard deviation of one month libor for calendar year was basis points 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the respective values calculated in the scenario labeled as base case 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates as of december  and actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
projected percentage change in portfolio net market value given us treasury yield curve movements change in projected change in portfolio treasury yield curve  projected change in net market value basis points portfolio net market value base case projected percentage change in portfolio net market value given credit spread movements change in projected change in portfolio credit spreads  projected change in portfolio net market value basis points net market value base case projected percentage change in portfolio net interest income given libor movements projected change projected change in projected change in portfolio in net income per change in libor  portfolio projected change in net interest income share basis points net interest income net income per share base case the aggregate sensitivity to short term rates has not changed year over year 
however  as detailed above a significant portion of the company s illiquid credit sensitive cmbs was match funded in with no short term rate risk 
as of december  the majority of the company s short term rate exposure was concentrated in the highly liquid rmbs portfolio which can be adjusted quickly to react to changes in short term rates 
credit risk the company s portfolios of commercial real estate assets are subject to a high degree of credit risk 
credit risk is the exposure to loss from loan defaults 
default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  property performance  property management  supply demand factors  construction trends  consumer behavior  regional economics  interest rates  the strength of the american economy and other factors beyond the control of the company 
all loans are subject to a certain probability of default 
the company underwrites its cmbs investments assuming the underlying loans will suffer a certain dollar amount of defaults and these defaults will lead to some level of realized losses 
loss adjusted yields are computed based on these assumptions and applied to each class of security supported by the cash flow on the underlying loans 
the most significant variables affecting loss adjusted yields include  but are not limited to  the number of defaults  the severity of loss that occurs subsequent to a default and the timing of the actual loss 
the different rating levels of cmbs will react differently to changes in these assumptions 
the lowest rated securities b or lower are generally more sensitive to changes in timing of actual losses 
the higher rated securities b or higher are more sensitive to the severity of losses 
the company generally assumes that all of the principal of a non rated security and a significant portion  if not all  of ccc and a portion of b rated securities will not be recoverable over time 
the loss adjusted yields of these classes reflect that assumption  therefore  the timing of when the total loss of principal occurs is the key assumption 
the interest coupon generated by a security will cease when there is a total loss of its principal regardless of whether that principal is paid 
therefore  timing is of paramount importance because the longer the principal balance remains outstanding the more interest coupon the holder receives to support a greater economic return 
alternatively  if principal is lost faster than originally assumed there is less opportunity to receive interest coupon therefore a lower or possibly negative return may result 
additional losses occurring due to greater severity will not have a significant effect as all principal is already assumed to be non recoverable 
if actual principal losses on the underlying loans exceed assumptions  the higher rated securities will be affected more significantly as a loss of principal may not have been assumed 
the company generally assumes that most if not all principal will be recovered by classes rated b or higher 
the company manages credit risk through the underwriting process  establishing loss assumptions and careful monitoring of loan performance 
before acquiring a controlling class security that represents a proposed pool of loans  the company will perform a rigorous analysis of the quality of all of the loans proposed 
as a result of this analysis  loans with unacceptable risk profiles will be removed from the proposed pool 
information from this review is then used to establish loss assumptions 
the company will assume that a certain portion of the loans will default and calculate an expected or loss adjusted yield based on that assumption 
after the securities have been acquired  the company monitors the performance of the loans  as well as external factors that may affect their value 
factors that indicate a higher loss severity or acceleration of the timing of an expected loss will cause a reduction in the expected yield and therefore reduce the earnings of the company 
furthermore  the company may be required to write down a portion of the adjusted purchase price of the affected assets through its income statement 
for purposes of illustration  a doubling of the losses in the company s controlling class cmbs  without a significant acceleration of those losses would reduce gaap income going forward by approximately per share of common stock per annum and cause a significant write down at the time the loss assumption is changed the amount of the write down depends on several factors  including which securities are most affected at the time of the write down  but is estimated to be in the range of to per share based on a doubling of expected losses 
a significant acceleration of the timing of these losses would cause the company s net income to decrease 
the total adjusted purchase price of controlling class cmbs at december  was per share 
the amount of adjusted purchase price that is not match funded in a cdo is per share 
the company s exposure to a write down is mitigated by the fact that most of these assets are financed on a non recourse basis in the company s cdos  where a significant portion of the risk of loss is transferred to the cdo bondholders 
asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing and or maturing of assets and liabilities 
it is the objective of the company to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to match the term of the company s liabilities as closely as possible with the expected holding period of the company s assets 
this is less important for those assets in the company s portfolio considered liquid as there is a very stable market for the financing of these securities 
other methods for evaluating interest rate risk  such as interest rate sensitivity gap defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period  are used but are considered of lesser significance in the daily management of the company s portfolio 
management considers this relationship when reviewing the company s hedging strategies 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect the company s net interest income positively or negatively even if the company were to be perfectly matched in each maturity category
