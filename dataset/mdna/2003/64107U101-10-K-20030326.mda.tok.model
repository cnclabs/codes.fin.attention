item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
we develop and market software solutions that enable our customers to interact more intelligently with their customers 
our solutions integrate and analyze information about customers  products and transaction activity to generate specific actions our customers can take to improve their marketing  selling and merchandising effectiveness  leading to increased revenue  improved profit  decreased costs and enhanced customer satisfaction 
we combine our software products with industry expertise and professional services to create highly focused  industry specific solutions that are designed to integrate with and add value to existing custom or purchased crm systems and processes 
we sell our solutions worldwide primarily through a direct sales force 
we license our products under various pricing plans  such as per user  per cpu  per site and per enterprise 
we generally grant licenses on a perpetual basis 
license fees for our products range from  to in excess of million 
we provide product maintenance pursuant to service agreements  the pricing of which is typically based on a percentage of the related product license fee and is generally paid in advance 
professional service fees for business consulting  implementation support  data processing and educational services are generally priced on a time and materials basis 
we were incorporated in delaware in july  and our initial product was shipped in january from inception through late  we expanded our organization by hiring personnel in key areas  particularly marketing  sales and research and development 
our total number of employees was on december  during and  we instituted certain restructuring plans to align our cost structure with our business outlook and general economic conditions 
in connection with our restructuring activities  our total number of employees was reduced to as of december  and as of december  we have sustained losses on a quarterly and annual basis since inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our net loss was million in including  in restructuring charges   of amortization of intangibles and non cash stock compensation expense and a million charge for the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles compared to a net loss of million in the prior year including million in restructuring charges  million of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles and non cash stock compensation expense and a million charge for the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
these losses resulted from significant costs incurred in the development and sale of our products and services  as well as a decline in our product revenues since the third quarter of which  based upon current marked conditions and other factors  is likely to continue in we anticipate that our operating expenses will also continue to decline in and will continue to constitute a material use of our cash resources 
we also expect to incur additional losses and continued negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
we do not expect to achieve profitability in our relatively limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results very difficult 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies in relatively new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
as described above in business corporate history and recent events  in february  in response to continued uncertainties in the marketplace and the difficulties we are likely to continue facing as a relatively small public company  we engaged us bancorp piper jaffray  inc to assist us in the exploration of near term strategic alternatives 
however  we cannot predict whether or when a 
table of contents transaction will result from this process 
based on the outcome of this process  we expect to determine in the near term how best to proceed to maximize stockholder value 
the kd acquisition in february  we acquired kd  a developer and marketer of advanced data analysis solutions for retailers 
in this transaction  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of kd in exchange for  shares of our common stock  and kd became our wholly owned subsidiary 
in addition  stock options of kd were converted into options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
for a discussion of the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets relating to the kd acquisition  see note to the consolidated financial statements and valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill below 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  investments  intangible assets  restructuring liabilities  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our revenues are recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we derive revenues from software licenses  software maintenance and professional services 
maintenance includes telephone and web based technical support  bug fixes and rights to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis 
professional services include project planning and management  implementation and testing  data analysis  user and partner training  consulting  product hosting and ongoing customer support 
for software arrangements that include multiple software products  maintenance or services  we allocate the total arrangement fee using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered maintenance and services elements  as determined by vendor specific objective evidence  is deferred and the remaining residual arrangement fee is recognized as software product revenue 
for software arrangements in which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of undelivered elements  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when vendor specific objective evidence is determined for the undelivered elements or when all elements for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence have been delivered 
revenues from license fees are recognized when a non cancelable agreement has been executed  the product has been shipped or electronically delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is considered probable 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenues are recognized as 
table of contents payments become due from the customer 
if we do not consider collection to be probable  then revenues are recognized when the fee is collected 
license revenues related to license terms of less than twenty four months are recognized ratably over the term of the license period 
when we offer products and services on a hosted basis  up front set up fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated service period 
we recognize revenues allocable to maintenance ratably over the term of the agreement 
we evaluate arrangements that include professional and or data processing services to determine whether those services are essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
if services are considered essential  revenues from the arrangement are recognized using contract accounting  generally on a percentage of completion basis 
when we do not consider the professional services to be essential  we recognize the revenues allocable to the services as they are performed 
revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
the most significant judgments for revenue recognition typically involve whether there are any significant uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and whether collectibility can be considered probable 
in addition  our transactions often consist of multiple element arrangements which must be analyzed to determine the relative fair value of each element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
sublease income 
in conjunction with the restructuring related charges recorded in and  we made certain estimates regarding future sublease income that have a significant impact on our anticipated cash obligations 
although we believe that our lease commitment estimates are appropriate in the current circumstances  future changes in real estate markets could impact the ultimate amount of cash paid to resolve these obligations 
as of december   we estimated total future sublease income of million of which million is covered by known sublease arrangements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
actual collection results could differ materially from those estimated and have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
litigation 
we have not recorded an estimated liability related to the class action lawsuit in which we are named 
for a discussion of this matter  see the section of this report entitled legal proceedings 
due to the uncertainties related to both the likelihood and the amount of any potential loss  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability and revise our estimates accordingly 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we review goodwill  identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets for impairment annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of business and asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or a significant adverse change in the business climate 
if such events or changes in circumstances are present  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the amount of impairment will be measured in accordance with the 
table of contents guidance of sfas all of our goodwill was assigned to a single reporting unit  which is our sole operating segment 
for a discussion of the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets relating to the kd acquisition  see note to the consolidated financial statements

there can be no assurance that we will meet any internal or external revenue expectations

netp incorporates certain key components from our non strategic product offerings  including components from personalization manager and distribution analyst 
product revenues 
product revenues declined to million in from million in product revenues declined in from million in product revenues comprised   and of total revenues for  and the decrease in product revenues in from was attributable to a continuation of the same factors that caused product revenues to decline in from  including the further deterioration of internet retailers  a longer sales cycle due to our pursuit of larger transactions with larger organizations  greater competition  and increased deferral of purchase decisions by our current and potential customers due to worsening economic and political uncertainty 
prior percentage growth rates of our product revenues have not been sustainable and we do not currently expect to achieve such prior percentage growth rates in the future 
based on current market conditions and other factors  the decline in our product revenues is likely to continue in service and maintenance revenues 
service and maintenance revenues consist primarily of professional and maintenance services and  secondarily  product hosting services 
our professional service revenues include business consulting  implementation support  data warehousing and processing and educational services and are generally offered on a time and materials basis 
maintenance revenues are generally derived from annual service agreements and are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
service and maintenance revenues decreased to million in from million in service and maintenance revenues decreased in from million in service and maintenance revenues comprised  and of total revenues for  and  respectively 
the decrease in service and maintenance revenues in absolute dollars in from reflected the further deterioration of the factors that caused the decline in service revenues in from  including lower levels of consulting and maintenance services due to the combined effect of fewer new customer acquisitions and a decline in our customer base  particularly internet retailers 
prior percentage growth rates of our service and maintenance revenues have not been sustainable and we do not currently expect to achieve such prior percentage growth rates in the future

the decrease in cost of product revenues in absolute dollars in compared to is due primarily to reduced product revenues and royalties payable to third parties 
the decrease in cost of product revenues in from is primarily attributable to a decrease in amortization of acquired technology cost in connection with our acquisition of kd in february 
table of contents and also to reduced product revenues and royalties payable to third parties 
since all internal development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products have been expensed as incurred  cost of product revenues includes no amortization of capitalized software development costs 
we believe that the cost of product revenues will decline as a percentage of product revenues in as our reliance on licensed third party technology continues to decline 
cost of service and maintenance revenues 
cost of service and maintenance revenues consists primarily of personnel related and infrastructure costs incurred in providing telephone and web based support of our software products  as well as professional  consulting  educational and hosted product related services to customers

the decrease in cost of services and maintenance revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in compared to prior years is primarily due to continued headcount reductions in our service organization as a result of our and restructuring and decreased use of third party consultants to staff consulting engagements 
cost of service and maintenance revenues may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon the mix of services that we provide and the utilization rate of our service personnel 
as stated above  and in note to the consolidated financial statements  in accordance with emerging issue task force issue no

these charges were partially offset by million of sublease income and  in proceeds from the sale of fixed assets 
in conjunction with the restructuring related charges recorded  we made certain estimates regarding future sublease income that have a significant impact on our anticipated cash obligations and related restructuring reserves 
although we believe that the lease commitment estimates are appropriate in the current circumstances  future changes in real estate markets could impact the ultimate amount of cash paid to discharge these obligations

table of contents risks that may affect future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we are an early stage company and we expect to encounter risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we were founded in july we began shipping products in the first quarter of the market for our products is unproven and our limited operating history makes an evaluation of our future prospects very difficult 
we have encountered  and will continue to encounter  risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we have not been able to successfully address certain of these risks 
if we do not begin to successfully address these risks  we may not achieve profitability  and we may suffer continued or increased operating losses 
our quarterly operating results are volatile and difficult to predict 
if we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
because our operating results are volatile and difficult to predict  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indication of our future performance 
historically  our operating results have been below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results will again be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly 
we cannot predict our future quarterly revenues with any degree of certainty for a variety of reasons  including we operate with a limited order backlog  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter  the market in which we compete is relatively new and rapidly evolving  we expect that  for the foreseeable future  revenues will come from licenses to a small number of customers  so delays or cancellations of orders by a few customers can significantly impact revenues within a quarter  our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer  and the timing of large orders can significantly affect revenues within a quarter 
historically  we have recognized a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of a quarter  with these revenues frequently concentrated in the last two weeks of the quarter 
accordingly  we cannot predict our financial results for any quarter until very late in the quarter 
a delay in an anticipated sale or revenue recognition near the end of a quarter can seriously harm our operating results for that quarter 
our expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term and are based  in part  on our expectations as to our future revenues 
as a result  any delay in generating or recognizing revenues could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in increased operating losses 

table of contents our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of general economic and market conditions 
we are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions 
the current general economic slowdown has had negative consequences for our business and operating results and may continue to do so 
for example  an economic slowdown may cause some current or potential customers to defer purchases  to go out of business or to have insufficient capital to buy our products 
an economic slowdown could also cause a significant reduction in the value of our investments 
if economic and market conditions do not improve  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we have a history of losses and expect to incur losses in the future 
we had net losses of million in  million in  million in  million in including million of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles related to the acquisition of kd and non cash stock compensation expense and million for the year ended december  including million in restructuring related charges  million of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles and non cash stock compensation expense and a million charge for the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
our net loss was million for the year ended december  including  in restructuring related charges   of amortization of intangibles and non cash stock compensation expense and a million charge for the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not had a profitable quarter and do not expect to have a profitable quarter in we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve profitability 
we may never achieve profitability 
a decline in the price of  demand for  or market acceptance of netp would seriously harm our business 
recently  we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues from one product netp as part of our strategy to focus our marketing and development efforts on netp  we have continued to wind down certain product and service offerings  including advertising advisor  which in accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
we anticipate that netp will account for a substantial majority of any revenues for the foreseeable future 
consequently  a decline in the price of or demand for netp  or the continued failure to achieve broad market acceptance for netp  would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders 
the market price for our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following  some of which are beyond our control actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of new technological innovations  increased cost of operations or new products or services offered by our competitors  conditions or trends in the industries into which we sell our products and services  changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other comparable companies  
table of contents volatility in the stock markets  particularly with respect to technology stocks  and decreases in the availability of capital for technology related businesses  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of additional shares of common stock  and potential litigation 
from april  the first day of public trading of our common stock  through december   the high and low sales prices for our common stock fluctuated between and 
on march   the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market was 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
securities litigation could result in substantial expense and distraction 
on november   timothy j 
fox filed a purported class action lawsuit against us  fleetboston robertson stephens  inc  the lead underwriter of our initial public offering in april  several other underwriters who participated in our initial public offering  steven j 
snyder  our then president and chief executive officer  and thomas m 
donnelly  our chief financial officer and chief operating officer 
for a discussion of this matter  see the section of this report entitled legal proceedings 
we may in the future be the target of other similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
our common stock may be delisted from nasdaq 
during  the closing price of our common stock was below for as many as consecutive business days 
we may fail to maintain the minimum closing bid price of for consecutive business days as required by the nasdaq national market 
if we are unable to demonstrate compliance with this or any other nasdaq requirement  nasdaq may take further action with respect to a potential delisting of our common stock 
we may appeal any such decision by nasdaq to the nasdaq listing qualifications panel 
if our common stock were delisted from nasdaq this could result  among other things  in a number of negative implications  including reduced liquidity in our common stock as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with nasdaq  as well as the potential loss of confidence by suppliers  customers and employees  the loss of analyst coverage and institutional investor interest  fewer business development opportunities and greater difficulty in obtaining financing 
we face intense competition and  if we are unable to compete successfully  we may be unable to increase our product sales and market share 
the market for our products is intensely competitive  evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
we believe principal competitive factors for our product include quality  breadth and depth of application offerings  product scalability  core technology and architecture  ease of deployment and maintenance  customer service and support  vendor viability and price 
although we believe our products currently compete favorably with respect to certain factors  our market is relatively new and is rapidly evolving 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial  marketing  sales  service  support  technical and other resources 

table of contents most of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  significantly greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than we have 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with current and potential customers of ours  have extensive knowledge of our industry and are capable of offering a single vendor solution 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products  than we can 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address customer needs 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we also expect that competition will increase as a result of software industry consolidations 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
our products have a lengthy sales cycle 
as a result  it is difficult to predict the quarter in which a sale may occur 
our solutions are relatively new to the marketplace 
as a result  we must use significant resources to educate potential customers on the use and benefits of our products 
in addition  we believe that the purchase of our products is relatively discretionary and involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources by a customer 
as a result  it usually takes our sales organization several months to finalize a sale and the length of the sales cycle can increase depending on the size of the proposed transaction and the potential customer 
this makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which a sale may occur 
our products can have a lengthy and or complex implementation cycle 
in addition  only a limited number of our customers have a deployed and operating application that utilizes our products 
as a result  we cannot be certain that our products will perform and be received as expected 
the implementation  including application design and deployment  of our products requires a commitment of resources by our customers 
the time required for implementation of our products has varied depending on the customer s application of the product 
we have licensed one or more of our products to more than customers 
however  only a small number of these customers have a fully deployed operating application that utilizes our products 
in addition  a significant number of our internet retail customers have gone out of business and are no longer utilizing our products 
because many of our customers have not yet fully implemented and deployed our products  we cannot be certain that our products will perform as designed  deliver the desired level of economic benefit to our customers  meet the other expectations and needs of our customers  achieve any significant degree of market acceptance  or perform to the level necessary to generate repeat customers and customer references 
if implementation services performed by us constitute a significant part of a product sales transaction  we recognize a substantial portion of our revenues from the sales transaction upon the delivery of the implementation services 
as a result  delays in service delivery could cause significant reduction in our license revenues and operating results for any particular period 

table of contents we have a new product that may not achieve market acceptance 
in june  we announced the commercial launch of netp in october   we announced the launch of netp  offering enhancements to netp  and we expect to continue to introduce new and enhanced product features in the future 
our products have not received a significant degree of market acceptance 
there are significant risks inherent in product introductions such as these 
these products may not address some or all of the needs of customers and may contain undetected errors or failures 
a lack of necessary features or errors or failures in the products will likely result in loss or delay of market acceptance 
we expect that our future financial performance will depend significantly on the successful sales  implementation and market acceptance of these new or enhanced products which may not occur on a timely basis or at all 
netp and netp  enhancements thereof  and any new products will be subject to significant technical risks 
we may fail to introduce or deploy new products or new releases on a timely basis  or at all 
in the past  we have experienced some delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of our new releases and new products 
these delays caused customer frustrations and delay or loss of product revenues 
some of our competitors currently offer products with features and functionality similar to those of netp and netp in the past  we have also experienced delays in purchases of our products by customers anticipating our launch of new releases or new products 
we could experience increased expenses or lost revenues if customers defer material orders in anticipation of new releases or new product introductions 
the software products we offer are complex and may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced  or as new versions are released 
we have in the past discovered software errors in our new releases and new products after their introduction 
we experienced delays in release during the period required to correct these errors 
we may discover errors in new releases or new products after the commencement of commercial shipments  despite testing by our personnel and our current and potential customers 
this may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  which could seriously impair our ability to achieve profitability 
acts of terrorism or war may hurt global economic conditions  which could harm our business 
our business is subject to and affected by forces  pressures and events affecting global economic conditions 
the september   terrorist attacks exacerbated global economic conditions and adversely impacted many businesses  including that of net perceptions 
future terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our employees  facilities  customers and suppliers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to generate repeat or expanded business from our current and future customers  we may be unable to build a critical mass of customers necessary to achieve increased sales and market share 
during  we were unable to materially expand our customer base and we may not be able to do so in the near future 
we currently depend on a limited number of key  high profile customers  and a substantial portion of our revenue is attributable to a single customer 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the accuracy  scalability  reliability and cost effectiveness of our products and services and our ability to effectively market such products and services 
in the past  we have lost potential customers to competitors for various reasons  including lower prices and other incentives not matched by us 
many of our customers demand an evaluation of our products prior to purchase 
if such evaluation is successful  the customer may purchase a license to use our products 
if we fail to generate business from our current and future customers  we may be unable to build a critical mass of customers necessary to achieve increased sales and market share 

table of contents if we fail to retain skilled salespeople as needed  we may be unable to increase market awareness and sales of our products and services 
our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at the senior management of our prospective customers 
as of december   our direct sales organization consisted of employees  which was decreased to employees by march  we may need to hire additional direct sales personnel in the future to sustain or expand our business 
however  we do not expect to increase the size of our sales organization in the near future 
furthermore  we might not be able to retain the kind and number of sales personnel we need 
if we are unable to retain needed skilled sales personnel  we may not be able to sustain our business 
if we are unsuccessful in retaining qualified service personnel  we may lose current customers or be unable to attract new customers 
customers that license our software typically engage our professional services organization to assist with support  training  consulting and implementation 
we believe that growth in our product sales depends on our ability to provide our customers with these services and to educate resellers on how to use our products 
from time to time  we receive customer complaints about the timeliness and accuracy of our customer support 
as of december   our professional services and customer support organization consisted of employees  which was decreased to employees by march  we may not be able to retain a sufficient number of the highly qualified service personnel that our business needs 
we may be unable to sublease or find suitable sub tenants for a portion of our principal executive offices and some of our other offices  and tenants may fail to make sublease payments 
in april  we executed a ten year lease for a new facility for our principal executive offices in minneapolis  minnesota 
we have sublet a significant portion of this facility to third parties and are currently seeking to sublease an additional portion of this facility 
we have also sublet all of the space at our berkshire  united kingdom facility and a portion of the space at our san francisco  california facility  and we terminated our lease at our new york  new york location 
we are also currently seeking to sublease our roseland  new jersey office space and our office space in austin  texas 
we may not be able to find suitable sub tenants for these properties in a timely manner  if at all 
if we are unable to find suitable sub tenants in a timely manner  or if our existing sub tenants fail to make sublease payments required under their respective sublease agreements  we may experience greater than anticipated operating expenses in the future 
if our intellectual property is not protected adequately  we may be unable to compete in the market 
we are a technology company 
our business depends in large part on protecting our intellectual property  which is one of our most important assets 
we rely upon a combination of trademark  copyright  patent and trade secret laws to protect our rights in our technology 
we license our software and require our customers to enter into license agreements  which impose restrictions on our customers ability to utilize the software 
in addition  we seek to avoid disclosure of our trade secrets  including but not limited to requiring those persons with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and restricting access to the source code for our software 
we have seven pending united states patent applications and four issued united states patents 
we also have exclusive license rights to three issued united states patents from the university of minnesota 
we plan to continue the prosecution process for only four of our seven pending applications 
it is possible that no patents will issue from the currently pending patent applications that we intend to pursue 
it is also possible that our current patents and potential future patents may be invalid or unenforceable 
it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages 
moreover  we may not develop future proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  and the patents of 
table of contents others may seriously limit our ability to conduct our business 
in this regard  we have not performed any comprehensive analysis of patents of others that may limit our ability to conduct our business 
we own a number of trademarks that we consider to be of substantial importance to our ability to market netp and future products and to our business generally 
these include net perceptions and netp 
the net perceptions mark is federally registered for a term of ten years and the netp mark is expected to be federally registered within six months to a year 
our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not succeed 
copyright  trade secret and trademark laws afford only limited protection for our proprietary rights in our software  documentation and other written materials and our trademarks 
unauthorized parties may be able to copy aspects of our products  obtain and use information that we regard as confidential and proprietary and infringe upon our trademarks 
policing unauthorized use of our products and trademarks is difficult 
while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate  and our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or our other intellectual property 
we may not be able to detect infringement or enforce our patent or other rights and  as a result  our competitive position in the market may suffer 
third party infringement claims against us or our technology suppliers could result in delays in product development  the loss of customers  or costly and time consuming litigation 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software industry regarding intellectual property rights 
we have from time to time received claims that we are infringing third parties intellectual property rights 
it is possible that in the future third parties may claim that our current or potential future products infringe their intellectual property rights  including under issued patents 
we expect that software companies such as net perceptions will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to secure continued access to required technology 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
claims of intellectual property infringement may also require us to pay significant damages or subject us to an injunction against the use of our products 
any successful claim of intellectual property infringement against us could have an immediate and significant impact on our ability to carry on our business and market our products 
in addition  in all of our paid software license agreements  we generally indemnify our customers against losses attributable to intellectual property infringement by our software 
should a third party bring a suit against a customer alleging that the customer s use of our software infringes its intellectual property rights  we could incur substantial costs in defending and resolving the suit 
our ability to increase our customer base and our sales depends on the continuing contribution of our key personnel and our ability to retain highly qualified personnel 
our business depends on the continued service of our key personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could seriously harm our ability to sustain our customer base and to sell our products 
as of december   we had employees  which decreased to as of march  we do not carry any key person life insurance policies 
our business also depends on our continuing ability to retain an adequate number of highly skilled managerial  technical  sales  marketing and customer support personnel 
if we fail to retain our key employees  we may be unable to service our current customers or attract new customers 

table of contents the market price of our common stock has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past 
to the extent this volatility and fluctuation continues  equity based compensation policies and plans  which have historically been significant in our retaining highly skilled personnel  may not be as effective as in the past 
we may be subject to potential product liability claims that could result in costly and time consuming litigation 
because our customers use our products for important applications  errors or defects in  or other performance problems with  our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers 
our customers could seek damages for losses from us 
although our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitation of liability provisions 
any product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly  and potential liabilities could exceed our available insurance coverage 
our current revenue recognition practices may need to change  which could seriously harm our business 
the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  software revenue recognition  in october and amended it by statements of position and there may be additional pronouncements issued in the future 
our current revenue accounting practices may need to change and such changes could seriously harm our future revenues and earnings 
provisions of our corporate organizational documents and rights agreement could delay or prevent a change of control  even if it would be beneficial to our stockholders 
various provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
in addition  the rights issued under our rights agreement may be a substantial deterrent to a person acquiring or more of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors 
these provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and rights agreement could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions 
our business could be seriously impacted by privacy and security concerns 
in some cases  our customers capture user preference and profile information each time a user interacts with the application utilizing our products or volunteers information in response to survey questions 
our customers generally have implemented security measures to protect such customer data from unauthorized disclosure or interception by third parties 
however  the security measures may not be effective against all potential security threats 
if a breach of customer data security were to be publicized  our products may be perceived as less desirable  and our future sales could be negatively impacted 
more importantly  even the perception of privacy and security concerns  whether or not valid  may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of our products 
in addition  legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten such concerns if  for example  our customers were required to notify users that the data captured after these interactions may be used by marketing entities to direct product promotion and advertising to that user 
legislation has been proposed at the federal and state levels that address some aspects of the internet  including a number of bills that specifically address internet privacy matters 
such proposed legislation indicates that some federal and state legislators believe that certain aspects of the internet and e commerce  including data privacy  are appropriate matters for regulation and review 
various other countries and political entities  such as the european union  have adopted legislation or regulatory requirements addressing issues  such as data privacy  that may directly impact some of our customers 
if user privacy concerns are not adequately addressed or if restrictive legislation is adopted in 
table of contents the united states  our business could be seriously harmed and we could experience increased operating losses 
if we do not respond to rapid technological changes  our products could become obsolete and we could become unable to compete in the market 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to predict because the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new software product introductions and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
to grow our business  we need to develop and introduce new software products and enhancements to existing products on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards  and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
in addition  we may fail to develop and market new products and enhancements to existing products that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards  experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these new products and enhancements to existing products  and fail to develop new products and enhancements to existing products that adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance 
if any of these events occur  we may be unable to compete successfully in the market for our products and services  and as a result  our business could fail 
the growth of the market for our products and services would be impaired if the use of the internet and electronic commerce do not grow as anticipated  and third parties do not continue to develop and improve the internet infrastructure 
our future revenues depend  in part  upon the increased acceptance and use of the internet and other on line services as a medium of commerce 
acceptance and use of the internet and on line services may not continue to develop at historical rates and a sufficiently broad base of customers may not adopt or continue to use the internet and other on line services as a medium of commerce 
demand and market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over the internet are subject to a high level of uncertainty and few proven services and products exist 
in addition  the internet may not be accepted as a viable long term commercial marketplace for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies and performance improvements 
to the extent that the internet continues to experience significant expansion in the number of users  frequency of use or bandwidth requirements  the infrastructure for the internet may be unable to support the demands placed upon it 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability as a commercial medium due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  or due to increased governmental regulation 
changes in  or insufficient availability of  telecommunications services to support the internet also could result in slower response times and adversely affect usage of the internet generally 
the growth of the market for our products and services would be impaired if use of the internet  the web and other on line services does not continue to increase or increases more slowly than expected  
table of contents the infrastructure for the internet  the web and other on line services does not effectively support expansion that may occur  or the internet  the web and other on line services do not become a viable commercial marketplace  which would inhibit the development of electronic commerce 
increasing government regulation could limit the market for our products and services  which could seriously impair the growth of our business or expose us to unanticipated liabilities 
as internet commerce evolves  we expect that federal  state or foreign governmental authorities will enact laws or adopt regulations covering issues such as user privacy  pricing  content and quality of products and services 
if enacted  such laws  rules or regulations could limit the market for our products and services 
although many of these regulations may not apply to our business directly  we expect that laws regulating the solicitation  collection or processing of personal customer information could indirectly affect our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk through december   the majority of our recognized revenues were denominated in united states dollars and were primarily from customers in the united states  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes has been immaterial 
however  future product license and service revenues could increasingly be derived from international markets and denominated in the currency of the applicable market 
as a result  our operating results could become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and  when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future 
our exposure to market risk is otherwise limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in debt securities issued by corporations and the united states government 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  the same hypothetical increase in interest rates as of december   would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our investments of approximately  our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate risk is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities in addition to debt and have adopted practices and policies to ensure that our portfolio remains adequately diversified 
due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest risk is mitigated 
furthermore  we place our investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments and do not hold any instruments for trading purposes
