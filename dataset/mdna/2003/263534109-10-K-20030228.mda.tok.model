the primary special items which contributed to the lower eitr are the sale of dupont pharmaceuticals  employee separation costs and write down of assets and agreement on certain prior year audit issues 
the eitr of percent is higher than the eitr of percent 
this increase is primarily due to the tax impact of the sale of dupont pharmaceuticals 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued research and development the company has broad and deep science and technology capabilities and its objective is to connect these capabilities to existing and new markets 
the company s goal is to achieve one third of total company revenues from new products introduced within the last five years by research and development expense was  million   million and  million in   and  respectively 
the decline in research and development expense over the three year period is primarily attributable to the company s divestiture of dupont pharmaceuticals  its research intensive pharmaceuticals subsidiary  on october  excluding pharmaceuticals  research and development expense in increased percent over research and development expense represents approximately percent of sales 
the company continues to support a strong commitment to research and development as a source of sustainable growth and expects research and development funding to remain at about the same level in because of its broad array of products and customers  the company s future financial performance is not materially dependent on the success or failure of any single research or development project

accounting standards issued not yet adopted in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt sfas no 
on january  the provisions of sfas no 
require companies to record an asset and related liability for the costs associated with the retirement of a long lived tangible asset if a legal liability to retire the asset exists 
based on the company s evaluation to date  the adoption of sfas no 
is expected to result in a charge of approximately 
per share that will be reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin no 
apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  as required  the company has adopted the disclosure requirements of the interpretation as of december  see note 
the company will apply the initial recognition and measurement provisions on a prospective basis effective january  the interpretation modifies existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees and requires that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
the company is in the process of evaluating the recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation and absent any unforeseen events  management does not expect that the adoption of these provisions will have a significant impact on the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
in  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
the company plans to begin expensing stock options granted to employees after january   using the prospective method as set forth in the guidelines of this statement as amended 
under historical grant levels and current valuation assumptions  the resulting increase in noncash expense is expected to reduce the company s earnings per share by approximately 
in this impact is expected to grow to about 
per share by and then stabilize  as most stock options vest over a three year period 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of certain variable interest entities vies  which is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin no 
addresses the application of arb no 
to vies  and generally would require that assets  liabilities  and results of the activity of a vie be consolidated into the financial statements of the enterprise that is considered the primary beneficiary 
the company currently has relationships with three vies within the financing structures of its synthetic lease programs 
see off balance sheet arrangements beginning on page 
these entities serve as the owner lessors and debt holders of the assets in the programs 
the assets and liabilities of these entities are not consolidated within the company s consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the fair values of the assets under these programs were approximately million and the fair values of the associated liabilities and noncontrolling interests were approximately million 
residual value guarantees part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued under these programs were million at december  the company is in the process of reviewing the provisions of fin no 
in response to this interpretation  the company has identified several options  including consolidating the vies into the company s consolidated financial statements  purchasing selected assets from the vies  or finding alternative financing sources 
none of these options are expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  liquidity  or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
judgments and assessments of uncertainties are required in applying the company s accounting policies in many areas 
for example  key assumptions are particularly important when determining the company s projected liabilities for pension and other postretirement employee benefits 
information with respect to pension and other postretirement employee expenses and liabilities  together with the impact of changes in key assumptions is discussed under long term employee benefits beginning on page other areas in which significant uncertainties exist include  but are not limited to  projected costs to be incurred in connection with environmental and tax matters and the resolution of litigation 
a discussion of environmental matters  including information as to the uncertainties involved in developing reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs is included under environmental matters beginning on page information on some of the key estimates and assumptions on which the company s annual provision for income taxes is based may be found under income taxes on page there is also significant uncertainty with respect to estimating legal liabilities 
factors which are considered include the nature of the specific claim  the company s experience with similar types of claims  the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed and the current status of the matter 
actual results will inevitably differ to some extent from the estimates on which the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared at any given point in time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that the company s management s discussion and analysis and audited consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective on the company 
corporate outlook the company expects earnings per share to reflect increased sales volumes  barring the occurrence of significant world events or economic disruption 
in addition  the company expects to benefit from continued efforts to control costs 
sales volumes in will reflect  in part  the worldwide gdp growth  which the company expects to be about percent for sales for the company s products most closely track the worldwide manufacturing sector  which has been lagging the overall recovery of the economy from the last recession 
in the united states  housing and motor vehicle production are both important markets to the company  in  housing sales are expected to continue at their record levels of and motor vehicle production is expected to be slightly below its record levels of the us production agriculture economic environment  which is also important to the company  is expected to be slightly more favorable in however  given the us manufacturing sector s very low capacity utilization  the company s ability to raise prices in the face of higher energy and raw material costs may be limited 
in addition to the macroeconomic environment  there are several important factors that influence the company s outlook for the year the combined impact of pension and other postretirement expenses is expected to negatively impact earnings per share by to  versus prior year 
the company expects its effective income tax rate in to be more in line with historical rates  significantly higher than the rate of percent 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued two newly adopted accounting standards will adversely impact earnings per share by about sfas no 
for asset retirement obligations and sfas no 
 as amended  for stock options 
prospects for longer term growth will continue to be influenced by the following factors growth in global economies  particularly those in north america  europe and asia pacific regions  improving market conditions including demand from the us manufacturing sector and production agriculture  successful commercialization of new products arising from research and development  stronger worldwide demand and strong pricing for commodity chemicals and polymer products  recovery of the depressed electronics and high technology markets  and the successful separation of the textiles interiors segment

overall  the global markets for textiles interiors products recovered modestly in from the recession of united states and most asian markets showed strong growth early in the year as inventories were replenished  while japan and europe lagged 
elastane and polyester fibers and intermediates experienced strong volume growth 
nylon fiber growth was modest because of competition from polyester  but nylon intermediates growth was stronger  driven by demand for engineering polymers and non fiber applications 
the migration of the apparel manufacturing industry to less expensive asian production  particularly china  continued as did the consolidation of apparel mill capacity in the united states and western europe 
in the united states  residential construction activity increased sharply in the first half of  encouraged by very low interest rates 
as a result  residential carpet and interior markets showed strong volume growth 
nonresidential construction continued to be weak due to excess capacity in the office and hospitality segments 
this resulted in weak fiber demand from this market 
fiber demand for the automotive industry was healthy  as new vehicle production remained strong  buoyed by low interest rates and manufacturer incentives 
overall  us mill consumption for fibers rebounded modestly from but excess fiber capacity globally continued to constrain prices 
margins were reduced in the second half of the year as raw material costs were driven up by oil prices while producers continued to have difficulty passing on cost increases

other significant developments included o as part of textiles interiors drive to capitalize on the strength of its newly combined businesses and become more competitive in response to rapidly accelerating industry structural changes  the company eliminated more than  employee positions worldwide  or percent of its global workforce 
more than two thirds of the reductions are in manufacturing facilities and offices in the united states  with most of the balance in europe 
in the united states  the company shut down its terathane r elastane intermediate manufacturing unit in niagara falls  new york  and less competitive portions of the elastane operations in waynesboro  virginia 
o textiles interiors antron r carpet fiber received the scientific certification systems environmentally preferable products certification 
the segment s commercial flooring business is the first and only carpet fiber manufacturer to achieve this certification which was granted as a result of demonstrated performance with less environmental and human health impact versus competing products 
o an impairment charge of million was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to write off goodwill associated with the commercial flooring business 
although the strategic intent of the business has not changed  the realization of the economic benefits from the business has been limited by poor economic conditions  particularly in the commercial office sector  and lower than expected margins in the competitive distribution market 
versus sales of billion were percent lower reflecting percent higher volume  more than offset by percent lower prices and a percent decline due to divestitures 
intermediate and apparel products both experienced lower sales 
sales were essentially flat for segment products sold into the carpet  interiors and industrial fiber markets as higher volumes offset lower prices 
atoi in was million excluding a charge of million attributable to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as discussed above 
includes a million net charge related to employee separation costs and assets write downs 
in  atoi was a loss of million and included million for net charges related to employee separation costs and asset write downs 
while segment sales declined  earnings benefited from reduced fixed costs reflecting restructuring programs in both years  lower energy based raw material costs  and a lower effective tax rate 
versus sales of billion were percent lower reflecting percent lower volume and percent lower prices 
atoi was a loss of million versus earnings of million 
the significant earnings decline reflected a combination of negative factors including very weak us apparel and textile markets  higher raw material costs  lower us dollar prices  and very weak global demand for carpet in both commercial and retail markets 
in addition  includes million in net charges resulting from employee terminations  facility shutdowns  and asset impairments as aggressive restructuring actions were taken during the year to address market conditions 
outlook as the world s largest producer and marketer of premium fibers  with manufacturing or marketing presence in every major market  textiles interiors is uniquely positioned to deal with the economic conditions in the global textile and soft floor coverings industries 
textiles interiors will continue to experience the adverse impact of industry consolidation and a shift in manufacturing to asia  which is expected to continue in the global textile markets  particularly in north america 
as a consequence  textiles interiors will focus on reducing costs and evolving its business model to become more competitive 
textiles interiors will continue to evaluate its various fiber business investments in changing market environments and explore strategies to optimize these investments 
petroleum based raw material costs are expected to have a significant impact on the segment s results of operations 
apparel growth from elastane sales branded and generic is anticipated in  as the demand for apparel with the comfort delivered through stretch and recovery continues to grow both geographically and across garment categories 
new opportunities for lycra r premium stretch fiber particularly shoes  home textiles  dupont tm leather with lycra r and stretch nonwovens part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued are poised for growth 
nylon textile industry capacity is expected to remain significantly above demand  pressuring prices in that sector 
north american and european economies are expected to improve in  resulting in increased demand for carpet fiber products and services 
however  demand for commercial carpet fiber is not expected to fully recover until when improved corporate profits are expected to drive higher construction spending 
auto builds and side airbag penetration will also be factors influencing the rate of anticipated growth of segment products 
the global intermediates market is expected to remain highly competitive 
several factors continue to impact sales  including weak polyester fiber market conditions in the united states and europe  excess global capacity  and potential increases in paraxylene and ethylene glycol pricing 
the company expects strong demand for pta in asia and continues to assess alternative strategies to optimize its polyester investments

a atoi loss of million included a net charge of million for employee separation costs 
versus sales were million in  as compared to million in atoi was a loss of million compared with a loss of million 
atoi in included a charge of million to increase the company s reserve for benlate r litigation 
liquidity capital resources the company considers its strong financial position and financial flexibility to be a competitive advantage 
the company s credit ratings of aa and aa from standard poor s s p and moody s investors services  respectively  and its commercial paper ratings of a l by s p and prime by moody s are evidence of that strength 
this advantage is based on strong business operating cash flows over an economic cycle  a commitment to cash discipline regarding working capital and capital expenditures  and the intent to pursue a fiscally responsible policy of accretive acquisitions consistent with the missions of the company s segments 
sources of liquidity the company s liquidity needs can be met through a variety of independent sources  including cash from operations  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  commercial paper markets  syndicated credit lines  bilateral credit lines  equity and long term debt markets  and asset sales 
the company s cash provided by operations was billion in  a 
billion reduction from the billion generated in the year over year reduction reflects increased tax payments  primarily related to the gain on the sale of dupont pharmaceuticals  and reduced revenues partially offset by lower operating costs 
in the company s cash provided by operations was billion less than the billion generated in  primarily due to recession related earnings declines and the strong us dollar 
in addition  the cash provided by operations included a benefit of million from the securitization of trade accounts receivable and a transfer from the pension trust fund of million to pay retiree health care costs 
no transfers were made from the pension trust fund to pay retiree health care costs in or cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities totaled billion at december   reflecting a billion decrease from december  the year over year reduction part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued is primarily due to the tax payments in associated with the gain on the sale of dupont pharmaceuticals 
the commercial paper market is a source of same day cash for the company 
the company can access this market at preferred rates given its strong credit rating 
the weighted average interest rates before taxes on commercial paper for  and  were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
at december   dupont s commercial paper balance was million  a million increase from december  in the unlikely event that the company would not be able to meet its short term liquidity needs  the company has access to approximately billion in same day credit lines with several major financial institutions 
these credit lines are split about equally between day and multi year facilities

off balance sheet arrangements commercial paper facility in the company implemented a commercial paper conduit program to reduce the financing costs of the company s existing accounts receivable securitization and synthetic lease programs by gaining direct access to the asset backed commercial paper market 
the conduit issues notes to third parties secured by the receivable interests and the equipment and real estate under synthetic leases 
in addition  the notes are backed by liquidity support 
as of december   the company was committed to provide up to million of such support 
the legal structure of the commercial paper conduit includes nonconsolidated entities that are not affiliated with the company through ownership interests 
no director  officer or employee of the company is a director  officer or employee of any of these entities 
at december  the fair value of the receivables and synthetic lease assets in the program was million excludes assets under construction of million 
costs of million to establish the commercial paper conduit were expensed in the accounts receivable securitization program was initiated in to sell an interest in a revolving pool of trade accounts part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued receivable 
as currently structured  the company sells certain trade receivables on a non recourse basis to a consolidated company  which in turn sells an interest in those receivables to a qualified special purpose entity qspe 
the qspe then sells the interest it purchased in those receivables to the commercial paper conduit 
proceeds received in from the sale of the interest were million and were reflected as a reduction in trade accounts receivable 
at december  the interest was million and was reduced to million at december  and million at december  as of december  miscellaneous receivables include an overcollateralization of million as security for this program

expenses in connection with this program were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company may terminate the program at any time by stopping the sale of receivables 
in the future  the company does not expect the interest sold in the revolving pool of receivables to exceed million 
a synthetic lease program was implemented in as an alternative financing source for selected assets at competitive rates 
this program has variable interest entities vies that serve as the owner lessor and debt holder of these assets 
the program is used for the sale and leaseback of corporate aircraft  rail cars and other equipment 
in addition  the company has entered into agreements to lease  upon completion  manufacturing and warehousing facilities 
as of december  the fair values of the assets under these leases were approximately million and the fair values of the associated liabilities and noncontrolling interests were approximately million 
the lease terms range from one to seven years 
lease payments totaled million in  million in  and less than million in and were reported as operating expense in the consolidated income statement 
there are two other synthetic leases that are not covered under the commercial paper conduit financing program  one of which is a vie that serves as the owner lessor of a manufacturing facility in singapore 
as of december   the fair value of this asset was approximately million and the fair value of the associated liabilities and noncontrolling interests was approximately million 
the second synthetic lease is for other miscellaneous equipment valued at approximately million 
lease terms range from one to five years 
lease payments for these assets totaled million in  million in  and less than million in and were reported as operating expenses in the consolidated income statement 
all synthetic leases are considered operating leases and accordingly the related assets and liabilities are not recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
furthermore  the lease payments associated with these programs vary based on ninety day libor 
the company may terminate the program at any time by purchasing the assets 
should the company decide neither to renew the leases nor to exercise its purchase option  it must pay the owner a residual value guarantee amount  which may be recovered from a sale of the property to a third party

applicable to the company s synthetic lease program discussed above and includes million of liquidity support 
applicable to the company s accounts receivable securitization program discussed above 
product warranty liability the company warrants to the original purchaser of its products that it will  at its option  repair or replace  without charge  such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect 
the term of part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued these warranties varies by product 
the estimated product warranty liability for the company s products as of december  is million 
the company has recourse provisions for certain products that would enable recovery from third parties for amounts paid under the warranty 
indemnifications in connection with the sale of company assets and businesses the company has indemnified respective buyers against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the sales transactions and business activities prior to the ultimate closing of the sale 
the term of these indemnifications  which typically pertain to environmental  tax  and product liabilities  is generally indefinite 
if the indemnified party were to incur a liability or have a liability increase as a result of a successful claim  pursuant to the terms of the indemnification  the company would be required to reimburse the buyer 
the maximum amount of future payments is generally unlimited 
the carrying amount recorded for all indemnifications as of december  is million 
although it is reasonably possible that future payments may exceed amounts accrued  due to the nature of indemnified items it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss 
no assets are held as collateral and no specific recourse provisions exist 
obligations for subsidiaries  equity affiliates and others the company has directly guaranteed various debt obligations under agreements with third parties related to subsidiaries  equity affiliates  and other unaffiliated companies 
at december   the company had directly guaranteed  million of such obligations includes approximately million of subsidiary bank borrowings which are recorded as debt in the company s consolidated financial statements 
this represents the maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments that the company could be required to make under the guarantees 
no material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees 
at december   the company has no liabilities recorded for these obligations other than subsidiary bank borrowings of approximately million  which are recorded as debt in the company s consolidated financial statements 
existing guarantees for external customers arose as part of contractual sales agreements 
existing guarantees for subsidiaries and equity affiliates arose for liquidity needs in normal operations 
the company would be required to perform on these guarantees in the event of default by the guaranteed party 
in certain cases  the company has recourse to assets held as collateral as well as personal guarantees from external customers 
in addition  the company has historically guaranteed certain obligations and liabilities of conoco inc  its subsidiaries and affiliates  which totaled million  plus interest  at december  conoco has indemnified the company for any liabilities the company may incur pursuant to these guarantees 
the restructuring  transfer and separation agreement between dupont and conoco requires conoco to use its best efforts to have conoco  or any of its subsidiaries  substitute for dupont

represents long term contracts with computer sciences corporation and accenture llp for information technology infrastructure and information systems consulting 
in summary  the company expects to meet its billion contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and does not expect to finance any of its billion of guarantees and other commercial commitments 
however  the company believes its financial strength and strong balance sheet could be used to satisfy these contractual obligations  guarantees and other commitments should unforeseen circumstances arise 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued long term employee benefits the company also has various obligations to its employees and retirees 
the company maintains retirement related programs in many countries that have a long term impact on the company s expenses and cash flows 
these plans are typically defined benefit pension plans  and medical  dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors 
about percent of the company s worldwide benefit obligation for pensions  and percent of the company s worldwide benefit obligation for retiree medical  dental and life insurance benefits  are attributable to the benefit plans covering substantially all us employees 
where permitted by applicable law  the company reserves the right to change  modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension and medical  dental and life insurance benefits 
benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees pay near retirement 
in the us  pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with us federal laws and regulations 
the company does not make contributions that are in excess of federal tax deductible limits 
the actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the company s actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits 
because plan assets exceeded the funding limitations imposed by us federal laws and regulations  no contributions to the principal us pension plan were made in and no contributions are currently required to be made in contributions to the principal us pension plan trust fund beyond are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets 
pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows 
pension coverage for employees of the company s non us consolidated subsidiaries are provided  to the extent deemed appropriate  through separate plans 
funding for each pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates 
thus  there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense 
in general  however  reduced asset valuations tend to result in higher contributions to pension plans 
in  the company contributed million to pension plans other than the principal us pension plan discussed above 
overall  the company anticipates contributions in to these pension plans to be higher  however  the impact is not expected to be significant to the company s cash flows 
generally accepted accounting principles require an adjustment to stockholders equity whenever the fair market value of year end pension assets are less than the accumulated benefit obligation 
for this purpose  each of the company s pension plans must be tested individually 
at year end  a non cash after tax charge of billion to stockholders equity was recorded in response to lower asset valuations and somewhat higher benefit obligations as of that date 
most of this adjustment is attributable to the principal us pension plan 
if pension plan asset values recover adequately  this adjustment will be reversed 
medical  dental and life insurance plans are unfunded and approved claims are paid from operating cash flows 
pretax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were million  million  and million  for   and  respectively 
this amount is expected to be about million in changes in cash requirements during this period reflect higher per capita health care costs  demographic changes  and changes in participant premiums  co pays and deductibles 
the company s net income is significantly affected by pension benefits as well as expenses for retiree medical  dental and life insurance benefits 
the following table summarizes the extent to which the company s net income over each of the last three years was favorably affected by pretax pension credits and adversely affected by pretax other postretirement benefit charges 
dollars in millions pretax pension credits pretax other postretirement benefit charges net pretax benefit charge the decrease in pension credits is primarily due to lower values for pension plan assets resulting from the decline in the equity markets 
the increase in other postretirement benefit expenses is primarily due to rapidly increasing medical costs 
the company s key assumptions used in calculating its long term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets  the rate of compensation increases  and the discount rate 
in  the company lowered its assumed rate of compensation increase from percent to percent to reflect a change in the company s outlook for future inflation 
the discount rate part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued used in these calculations was determined to be percent in based on high quality corporate bond rates 
the company has lowered its long term expected rate of return on us pension plan assets from percent to percent in it is expected that the effect of actual investment results during  coupled with the changes outlined above  will negatively impact earnings per share by to 
with respect to other postretirement benefits  in october  the company announced that it redesigned its us health care plan to allow the company to continue to provide a fully competitive benefit offering to both employees and retirees 
the company will continue to provide health care coverage to retirees and survivors but established limits on the company s portion of the cost of coverage 
these limits are not expected to be reached for several years 
for medical  the limit will apply no sooner than january  for dental  the changes in premium structure will take effect in it is expected that these changes  partially offset by the effect of higher medical costs  will positively impact earnings per share by approximately 
environmental matters dupont operates global manufacturing facilities  product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations 
company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements 
in addition  dupont implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions  eliminate the generation of hazardous waste  decrease the volume of wastewater discharges  increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent  bioaccumulative and toxic pbt materials 
the costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations  as well as internal voluntary programs and goals  are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future 
even though these costs may increase in the future  they are not expected to have a material impact on the company s competitive or financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
in dupont spent about million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company s internal environmental goals 
the company currently estimates expenditures for environmental related capital projects will total million in in the us  significant capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment  storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the clean air act caa 
until all caa regulatory requirements are established and known  considerable uncertainty will remain regarding future estimates for capital expenditures 
total caa capital costs over the next two years are currently estimated to range from million to million 
the environmental protection agency epa challenged the us chemical industry to voluntarily conduct screening level health and environmental effects testing on nearly  high production volume hpv chemicals or to make equivalent information publicly available 
an hpv chemical is a chemical listed on the inventory update rule with annual us cumulative production and imports of one million pounds or more 
the cost to dupont of testing for hpv chemicals it makes is estimated to be a total of to million from  for the entire chemical industry  the cost of testing is estimated to be million 
global climate change is being addressed by the framework convention on climate change adopted in the kyoto protocol  adopted in december  is an effort to establish short term actions under the convention 
it is expected that will mark ratification of the protocol by enough countries that it will enter into force 
the united states is unlikely to ratify the protocol and has announced a less restrictive climate policy framework  emphasizing voluntary action 
the kyoto protocol would establish significant emission reduction targets for six gases considered to have global warming potential and would drive mandatory reductions in developed nations outside the united states 
dupont has a stake in a number of these gases co  no  hfcs and pfcs and has been reducing its emissions of these gases since the company is well ahead of the target timetable contemplated by the protocol 
however  on a global basis  the company faces prospects of country specific restrictions where major reductions have not yet been achieved 
dupont is working to enable success of emissions trading mechanisms under the protocol that could aid in satisfying such country specific requirements 
emission reduction mandates within the united states are not expected in the near future  though congressional proposals for such mandates have been introduced 
dupont has recently discovered that very low levels of dioxins parts per trillion to low parts per billion and related compounds are inadvertently generated during its titanium dioxide pigment production process 
the company has launched an extensive research and process engineering development program to part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued identify the cause of the dioxin generation and to identify process modifications that will eliminate dioxin formation 
dupont has aggressive goals to reduce such dioxin generation by percent by over percent of the dioxin generated at dupont s production plants becomes associated with process solid wastes that are disposed in controlled landfills where public exposure is negligible 
pretax environmental expenses charged to current operations totaled about million in compared with million in both and these expenses include the remediation accruals discussed below  operating  maintenance and depreciation costs for solid waste  air and water pollution control facilities  and the costs of environmental research activities 
while expenses related to the costs of environmental research activities are not a significant component of the company s overall environmental expenses  the company expects these costs to become proportionally greater as the company increases its participation in businesses for which environmental assessments are required during product development 
the largest of these expenses in resulted from the operation of water pollution control facilities and solid waste management facilities for about million and million  respectively 
about percent of total annual environmental expenses resulted from the operations in the united states 
remediation accruals dupont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted 
much of this liability results from the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  often referred to as the superfund  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state laws 
these laws require the company to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where the company conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where company generated waste was disposed 
the accrual also includes a number of sites identified by the company for which it is probable that environmental remediation will be required  but which are not currently the subject of cercla  rcra or state enforcement activities 
over the next two decades the company may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra 
remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site 
these activities  and their associated costs  depend on the mix of unique site characteristics  evolving remediation technologies  diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies  as well as the presence or absence of potentially responsible parties prps 
therefore  it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs 
at december   the company s consolidated balance sheet included an accrued liability of million as compared with million at year end considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and  under adverse changes in circumstances  potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued as of december  of the million accrued liability  approximately percent is for non us facilities 
approximately percent of the company s us environmental reserve at december   was attributable to rcra and similar remediation liabilities  while percent was attributable to cercla liabilities 
during  remediation accruals of million were added to the reserve compared with million in remediation expenditures rcra extensively regulates and requires permits for the treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous waste 
rcra requires that permitted facilities undertake an assessment of environmental contamination at the facility 
if conditions warrant  companies may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations 
as contrasted by cercla  the costs of the rcra corrective action program are typically borne solely by the company 
the company anticipates that significant ongoing expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required over the next two decades 
annual expenditures for the near term  however  are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years 
longer term  expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 
the company s expenditures associated with rcra and similar remediation activities were approximately million in  million in and million in the company  from time to time  receives requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that the company is a prp under cercla or similar state statute 
the company has also  on occasion  been engaged in cost recovery litigation initiated by those agencies or by private parties 
these requests  notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sites that typically are not company owned  but allegedly contain wastes attributable to the company s past operations 
as of december   the company had been notified of potential liability under cercla or state laws at sites around the united states  with active remediation under way at of these sites 
in addition  the company has resolved its liability at sites  either by completing remedial actions with other prps or by participating in de minimis buyouts with other prps whose waste  like the company s  represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site 
the company received notice of potential liability at new sites during compared with similar notices in and in in  sites were settled by the company 
the company s expenditures associated with cercla and similar state remediation activities were approximately million in  million in and million in for nearly all superfund sites  the company s potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to the company versus that attributable to all other prps is relatively low 
other prps at sites where the company is a party typically have the financial strength to meet their obligations and  where they do not  or where prps cannot be located  the company s own share of liability has not materially increased 
there are relatively few sites where the company is a major participant  and the cost to the company of remediation at those sites  and at all cercla sites in the aggregate  is not expected to have a material impact on the competitive or financial position  liquidity or results of operations of the company 
total expenditures for previously accrued remediation activities under cercla  rcra and similar state laws were million in  million in and million in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments derivatives and other hedging instruments under procedures and controls established by the company s financial risk management framework  the company enters into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to hedge its exposure to foreign currency  interest rate and commodity price risks 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions and major petrochemical and petroleum companies 
although the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties  this exposure is managed through credit approvals  limits and monitoring procedures and  to the extent possible  by restricting the period over which unpaid balances are allowed to accumulate 
the company does not anticipate nonperformance by counterparties to these contracts  and no material loss would be expected from any such nonperformance 
foreign currency risk the company s objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency rate changes 
accordingly  the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  commitments and cash flows 
the company routinely uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its net exposures  by currency  related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations 
the primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes  net of related tax effects  are minimized 
in addition  option and forward exchange contracts are used to hedge a portion of anticipated foreign currency revenues so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the related foreign currency denominated revenues 
from time to time  the company will enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case by case basis taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure  market volatility and economic trends 
forward exchange contracts are also used from time to time to manage near term foreign currency cash requirements and to place foreign currency deposits and marketable securities investments into currencies offering favorable returns 
part ii item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued interest rate risk the company uses a combination of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps and structured medium term financings  as part of its program to manage the interest rate mix of the total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed for floating rate interest payments to effectively convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt based on libor or commercial paper rates 
interest rate swaps allow the company to maintain a target range of floating rate debt 
structured medium term financings consist of a structured medium term note and a concurrently executed structured medium term swap which  for any and all calculations of the note s interest and or principal payments over the term of the note  provide a fully hedged transaction such that the note is effectively converted to a us dollar denominated fixed or floating interest rate payment 
structured medium term swaps allow the company to be fully hedged against fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates and to achieve us dollar fixed or floating interest rate payments below the market interest rate  at the date of issuance  for borrowings of comparable maturity 
commodity price risk the company enters into exchange traded and over the counter derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases 
a portion of energy feedstock purchases is hedged to reduce price volatility using various risk management strategies 
hedged commodity purchases include natural gas  ethane and cyclohexane 
in addition  certain sales of ethylene are also hedged 
pioneer contracts with independent growers to produce finished seed inventory 
under these contracts  pioneer compensates growers with bushel equivalents that are marketed to pioneer for the market price of grain for a period of time following harvest 
pioneer uses derivative instruments such as commodity futures that have a high correlation to the underlying commodity to hedge the commodity price risk involved in compensating growers 
additional details on these and other financial instruments are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
value at risk a value at risk var analysis provides a forward looking perspective of the maximum potential loss in fair value for a defined period of time assuming normal market conditions and a given confidence level 
the company s risk management portfolio consists of a variety of hedging instruments which provide protection from volatility in the areas of interest rates  foreign currency  agricultural commodities  and energy feedstock commodities 
the valuations and risk calculations for the var analysis were conducted using the company s risk management portfolios as of december  and the var analysis used a monte carlo simulation type model with an exponentially weighted covariance matrix  and employed  pseudo random market paths including all risk factors associated with the hedging instruments in the company s risk management portfolios 
the calculations were conducted over a business day period at a percent confidence level 
the following table details the results of the var analysis for each significant risk management portfolio at the end of both and dollars in millions interest rates foreign currency agricultural commodities energy feedstock commodities the table above represents the var maximum potential loss when each risk management portfolio is valued individually 
var for the entire risk management portfolio is a loss of million for and a loss of million for  these values reflect the diversification benefits and covariance correlation of the total portfolio 
change in the foreign currency var in compared to reflects higher volatilities and a larger portfolio 
the var model results are only an estimate and are not intended to forecast actual losses that may be incurred in future periods 
since the company s risk management programs are highly effective  the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposures
