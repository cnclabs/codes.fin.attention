as you read this discussion and analysis  refer to our consolidated statements of income loss  which present the results of our operations for   and  and are summarized on the following pages 
we analyze and explain the differences between periods for the components of net income loss in the following sections 
our analysis is important in making decisions about your investment in sitel corporation 
general business risks  critical accounting policies and estimates general business risks our business success depends on our ability to efficiently deploy our human and capital resources in the delivery of services to our clients 
consequently  the needs of our clients may significantly impact our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
our results of operations and operating cash flows may vary with periodic wins and losses of client contracts and with changes in the scope of client requirements 
our top clients accounted for of our revenues in  and include multiple independently managed business units of general motors corporation 
these general motors business units were responsible for of our total revenues in we did not have any other clients under common control that generated or more of our revenues 
two of the primary general motors contracts expire in january we are currently in negotiations regarding the continuation of services for these clients beyond the expiration date 
the financial failure of any of these clients or the loss of any or all of their business could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
our liquidity  including our ability to comply with debt covenants  may be adversely affected if we were to lose a significant client or as a result of significant changes in client demand if we are unable to efficiently re deploy our human and capital resources 
in the following sections  we also discuss the importance of our critical accounting policies and the use of accounting estimates  and their potential impacts on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies and practices are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
of those policies  we have identified the following to be critical accounting policies because they are the most important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial condition  and they require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments estimates of uncollectible trade accounts receivable to determine an allowance for doubtful accounts  estimates of the useful lives for property and equipment  estimates of the recovery of our long lived assets and the fair market value of goodwill  and estimates of future taxable income that is required to support the carrying value of deferred tax assets and estimates of the related valuation allowance 
trade accounts receivable we report our trade accounts receivable net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  which represents management s estimates of the amount of our receivables that may not be collectible  net of recoveries of amounts previously written off 
these estimates are based on a detailed aging analysis of accounts receivable  historical bad debts  client credit worthiness  and changes in our client payment terms 
the financial condition of our clients may deteriorate  which may require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we would record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as operating  selling  and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income loss  which would reduce our results of operations 
our accounts receivable balance at december  was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
property and equipment we record property and equipment at cost  and calculate depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from to years 
we amortize leasehold improvements and assets under capital leases on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 
if the actual useful lives of these assets are less than the estimated depreciable lives  we would record additional depreciation expense or losses on disposal to the extent the net book value of such asset is not recovered upon sale 
asset impairment in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  under this standard  we monitor events and changes in circumstances that may require us to review the carrying value of our long lived assets 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets based on estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows 
our assessment of the recoverability of our long lived assets will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
goodwill goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price we paid in acquisitions  using the purchase method of accounting  and the fair value of the net assets we acquired 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of january  as a result of the adoption of this standard  we stopped amortizing our goodwill effective january   which means that we have not recorded any goodwill amortization expense in our consolidated statements of income loss for the year ended december  and we will not record such amortization in future years 
during  we performed a transitional goodwill impairment review in two phases to determine if goodwill that was stated in our consolidated balance sheet at january  was impaired 
during the second quarter of  we completed the first phase of the required impairment review  and determined that the goodwill in certain reporting units was impaired at january  we completed the second phase of the transitional impairment review during the fourth quarter of as a result of these reviews  we recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment loss of million as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the financial statements 
effective as of october   we completed a further analysis of our goodwill and determined no additional impairment was required 
as of december   we have goodwill of million 
at least annually or more frequently as changes in circumstance indicate  we will evaluate the estimated fair value of our goodwill 
on these evaluation dates  to the extent that the carrying value of the net assets of any of our reporting units having goodwill is greater than their estimated fair value  we will be required to take additional goodwill impairment charges 
deferred income taxes we must report some of our revenues and expenses differently for our financial statements than we do for income tax purposes 
the future tax effects of the differences in these items  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  are reported as deferred tax assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future estimated taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire 
these assets consist of tax amortization in excess of book amortization related to the acquisition of a business and certain net operating losses and tax credits carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of future taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets can be recovered 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we revise these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
use of accounting estimates management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and our reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could differ from these estimates 
results of operations in this section  we discuss our operating results and the factors affecting them 
we begin with a general overview  then separately discuss the components of net income loss in more detail 
we describe our general business risks  critical accounting policies  and estimates that are important to our operating results on the previous page 
please refer to that discussion as you read this section 
overview we summarize our net income loss and net income loss per common share diluted  and the impacts of asset impairment and restructuring expenses  change in accounting method  and other items  in the following tables net income loss years ended december  in millions net income loss  before restructuring expenses and other items goodwill impairment charge under sfas asset impairment and restructuring expenses  after tax losses on disposals of fixed assets  after tax write off of credit acquisition costs valuation allowance on deferred tax assets tax benefit expected to to be realized in future years net income loss compared to we had a net loss of million  or per share  in  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in results in were primarily impacted by the million goodwill write off that was recorded as of january   a million asset impairment and restructuring charge in the third quarter  and a million valuation allowance on deferred tax assets recorded in the fourth quarter 
all of these items are summarized in the table above 
excluding the goodwill write off and other items described above in and the asset impairment  restructuring expenses  and other items described above in  we had net income of million  or per share  in compared to net income of million  or per share  in this increase resulted mostly from a increase in revenues and higher operating margins in net income loss per common share diluted years ended december  net income loss per share  before restructuring expenses and other items goodwill impairment charge under sfas asset impairment and restructuring expenses  after tax losses on disposals of fixed assets  after tax write off of credit acquisition costs valuation allowance on deferred tax assets tax benefit expected to be realized in future years net income loss per share compared to we had a net loss of million  or per share  in  compared to net income of million  or per share  in results in were primarily impacted by asset impairment and restructuring expenses and other items that we recorded in the second and third quarters of the year 
these charges were offset partially by a million net income tax benefit that we recorded as a result of our election to treat certain of our foreign operations as branches of our us company for us income tax purposes 
all of these items are summarized in the table above 
excluding the asset impairment and restructuring expenses and other items described above in and million of after tax asset impairment and restructuring expenses in  we had net income of million  or per share  in compared to net income of million  or per share  in this decline resulted mostly from a decrease in revenues and lower gross profit margins in components of net income loss as you read this section  please refer to the following table that summarizes our income statement data on a percentage of revenue basis 
years ended december  in thousands revenues direct labor and telecommunications expenses   subcontracted and other services expenses   operating  selling  and administrative expenses  asset impairment and restructuring expenses   operating income loss    interest expense  net equity in earnings loss of affiliates  other expense  net  income loss before income taxes  minority interest and change in accounting method    income tax expense benefit minority interest   income loss before change in accounting method   cumulative effective of a change in accounting for goodwill net income loss a    a during  we adopted the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  and ceased amortizing goodwill 
if we had not amortized our goodwill during the two years ended december  our net income loss would have been  in  and  in compared to revenues revenues increased million  or  in compared to the increases in revenues by geographic region are shown in the following table in millions north america europe asia pacific latin america the increase in north america revenues was mostly due to additional customer care and customer acquisition services we provided to a number of our large global clients and to new work performed by our risk management business 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in technical support services 
the weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound and euro accounted for about million  or  of the increase in europe along with the ramp of new customer programs 
the increase in latin america revenues was due mostly to new work we performed for clients in mexico and to revenues from our panama site  as we began serving clients from that facility during the fourth quarter of as a result of certain revisions in the governance of a joint venture  we reported our investment in certain latin america affiliates using the equity method of accounting  rather than the consolidation method  effective october  as a result of this change  our latin america revenues will no longer include the revenues associated with the joint venture 
our revenues were approximately million lower due to the change in accounting 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses direct labor and telecommunications expenses include the compensation of our customer service professionals and their first line supervisors and telephone usage expenses directly related to the production of revenues 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenues can vary based on the nature of the contract  the nature of the work  and the market in which the services are provided 
accordingly  direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenues can vary  sometimes significantly  from year to year 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses increased million  or  in compared to as a percentage of revenues  direct labor and telecommunications expenses decreased from in to in however  as we discuss in the following section  we subcontract certain client services to our india joint venture 
we do not incur direct labor and telecommunication expenses for these subcontracted services  as such costs are incurred by the joint venture 
excluding the revenues we have recorded from clients where we have subcontracted the services to our india joint venture  direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from in compared to in  primarily due to lower unit prices from our clients 
subcontracted and other services expenses subcontracted and other services expenses include services provided to clients through subcontractors and other out of pocket expenses 
subcontracted and other services expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase in these expenses was mostly due to subcontracted expenses of million paid to our india joint venture as we began serving clients from that facility during the third quarter of operating  selling and administrative expenses operating  selling and administrative expenses represent expenses incurred to directly support and manage the business  including costs of management  administration  technology  facilities  depreciation and amortization  maintenance  sales and marketing  and client support services 
operating  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in compared to excluding goodwill amortization expense of million from the year ended december   operating  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or 
the decline in these expenses was mostly due to our restructuring plan that began at the end of the third quarter of  partially offset by the ramp up of new customer programs in europe in the third quarter of as a percentage of revenues  operating  selling and administrative expenses decreased from in  excluding goodwill amortization expense  to in asset impairment and restructuring expenses during  in connection with the restructuring plan announced in  we recorded additional restructuring charges of million associated with the write off of contact center operations and corporate support services identified in in  we announced a restructuring plan designed to intensify our focus on core competencies  accelerate revenue growth  and improve profitability 
the key components of the restructuring plan include several major organizational changes and the streamlining of contact center operations and corporate support services to improve effectiveness and drive revenue growth 
as part of our restructuring plan  we reduced fixed overhead to improve profitability by substantially completing the following by december  eliminating approximately operating  selling  and administrative positions globally  and reducing excess capacity by closing nine contact centers plus three administrative offices  and downsizing another five contact centers plus two administrative offices  resulting in the elimination of approximately  workstations 
in the second quarter of  we recorded million of asset impairment and restructuring charges  or million net of tax  related to the restructuring plan we announced in june as described above 
in the third quarter of  we recorded million of additional charges related to the plan 
operating income loss we had operating income of million in  compared to an operating loss of million in excluding the asset impairment and restructuring expenses in both years and goodwill amortization expense in  operating income increased million from million in to million in as a percentage of revenues  operating income was in compared to in this change resulted from all of the factors affecting revenues and expenses discussed earlier in this section 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  was slightly lower in compared to equity in earnings loss of affiliates equity in earnings loss of affiliates represents our percentage share of the earnings loss from our investment in a joint venture in india 
as discussed previously  effective october   we revised our joint venture agreement and the results of our operations in certain latin america affiliates are now being accounted for under the equity method 
as a result  equity in earnings loss of affiliates increased by million in as compared to primarily due to us beginning to serve clients from the india facility in the third quarter of other expense  net other expense  net of other income  decreased million in compared to mostly because we recorded million of losses on disposals of certain assets recognized in income tax expense benefit we recorded income tax expense of million in compared to an income tax benefit of million in the income tax expense reflects a million deferred income tax expense we recorded in the fourth quarter to increase the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that were recorded in prior years related to an asia pacific subsidiary 
in  income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes  minority interest and change in accounting method  excluding the charge in our deferred tax valuation allowance was 
the difference between this rate and the statutory us federal rate of was primarily due to net operating losses in certain european and asia pacific subsidiaries for which no tax benefit was recognized and us state and local income taxes offset by lower international tax rates in certain jurisdictions 
the benefit reflects a million net deferred income tax benefit we recorded in the first quarter that resulted from an election to treat certain of our foreign operations as branches of our us company for us income tax purposes  and the million tax benefit we recorded on the asset impairment and restructuring charges and the losses on disposals of assets in the second quarter 
these benefits were offset by a million deferred income tax expense we recorded in the second quarter to establish a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that were recorded in prior years related to our united kingdom subsidiaries 
compared to revenues revenues decreased million  or  in compared to the changes in revenues by geographic region are shown in the following table in millions north america europe asia pacific latin america revenues decreased in europe mostly due to the loss of two large clients in the united kingdom  which took their customer acquisition businesses in house  and lower revenues in spain 
the strength of the us dollar versus the british pound and euro accounted for about million  or  of this decrease 
the decrease in asia pacific primarily related to restructuring our operations in japan and transferring our existing japanese business to bellsystem in the second quarter of the decrease in north america was primarily attributable to a reduction in customer acquisition revenues that was due  in part  to the september th  attack on the united states 
the increase in latin america was attributable to new work we performed for clients in brazil and mexico 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses direct labor and telecommunications expenses include the compensation of our customer service professionals and their first line supervisors and telephone usage expenses directly related to the production of revenues 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenues can vary based on the nature of the contract  the nature of the work  and the market in which the services are provided 
accordingly  direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenues can vary  sometimes significantly  from year to year 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses increased million  or  in compared to as a percentage of revenues  direct labor and telecommunications expenses increased from in to in this increase was primarily due to reduced labor efficiency caused by an unanticipated decline in revenues  a higher than normal number of client programs ramping up and ramping down during the year  and some reductions in pricing 
subcontracted and other services expenses subcontracted and other services expenses include services provided to clients through subcontractors and other out of pocket expenses 
subcontracted and other services expenses decreased million  or  in compared to the decline in these expenses was due mostly to a reduction in the use of third party contact centers in the us due to a reduction in customer acquisition services and lower reimbursable expenses in the us and europe 
operating  selling and administrative expenses operating  selling and administrative expenses represent expenses incurred to directly support and manage the business  including costs of management  administration  technology  facilities  depreciation and amortization  maintenance  sales and marketing  and client support services 
operating  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in compared to the decline in these expenses was mostly due to our restructuring plan that began at the end of the second quarter of as a percentage of revenues  operating  selling and administrative expenses were about the same in as they were in asset impairment and restructuring expenses in  we announced a restructuring plan designed to intensify our focus on core competencies  accelerate revenue growth  and improve profitability 
the key components of the restructuring plan include several major organizational changes and the streamlining of contact center operations and corporate support services to improve effectiveness and drive revenue growth 
as part of our restructuring plan  we reduced fixed overhead to improve profitability by substantially completing the following by december  eliminating approximately operating  selling  and administrative positions globally  and reducing excess capacity by closing nine contact centers plus three administrative offices  and downsizing another five contact centers plus two administrative offices  resulting in the elimination of approximately  workstations 
in connection with this restructuring  we recorded million of asset impairment and restructuring charges in we estimate that the ongoing annual savings from the restructuring will exceed million 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill  based on estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows 
while management currently believes that estimated future operating cash flows will be sufficient to recover such assets  there can be no assurance that such estimates will be achieved 
if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved  we may need to record impairment losses on these assets in future periods 
in  we formed a strategic partnership with bellsystem  inc  japan s largest comprehensive marketing agency 
under the terms of the partnership  bellsystem provides services and support for our clients in japan and we provide services and support for bellsystem s clients in the united states 
in connection with the formation of the partnership  we restructured our operations in japan and transferred our existing japanese business to bellsystem in connection with this restructuring  we recorded a million asset impairment and restructuring charge  or million after tax  in operating income loss we had an operating loss of million in  compared to operating income of million in excluding the asset impairment and restructuring expenses discussed earlier  operating income as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in this change resulted from all of the factors affecting revenues and expenses discussed earlier in this section 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  was about the same in as it was in equity in earnings loss of affiliates we recognized a loss of million associated with the operating results of affiliates accounted for under the equity method 
this loss was attributed primarily to the establishment of operations in india which did not exist in other expense  net other expense  net of other income  increased million in compared to mostly because we recorded million of losses on disposals of certain assets  and we wrote off million of credit acquisition costs in connection with the amendment of our credit facility in income tax expense benefit we recorded an income tax benefit of million in compared to income tax expense of million in the benefit reflects a million net deferred income tax benefit we recorded as a result of our election to treat certain of our foreign operations as branches of our us company for us income tax purposes  and a million tax benefit we recorded on asset impairment and restructuring charges and losses on disposals of assets in the second quarter of these benefits were offset by a million deferred income tax expense we recorded to establish a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that were recorded in prior years related to our united kingdom subsidiaries 
in  income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes and minority interest  excluding asset impairment and restructuring expenses and the above special items  was 
the difference between income tax expense and the expense which would result from applying the statutory us federal rate of was primarily due to non deductible goodwill  net operating losses in certain subsidiaries for which no tax benefit was recognized  higher international tax rates in certain jurisdictions  and us state and local income taxes 
financial condition and liquidity in this section  we discuss our financial condition and liquidity and the factors affecting them 
we separately discuss cash flows  capital resources  and contractual obligations and commitments 
we describe our general business risks  critical accounting policies  and estimates that are important to our financial condition and liquidity earlier in this report 
please refer to that discussion as you read this section 
cash flows the following table sets forth summary cash flow data for the periods indicated 
please refer to this summary as you read our discussion of the sources and uses of cash in each year 
years ended december  in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities in  cash provided by operating activities came from income before asset impairment and restructuring expenses  depreciation and amortization  and other charges of million and a million decrease in trade accounts payable  which were partially offset by a million increase in trade accounts receivable and other assets 
in  we used cash for investing activities mostly to purchase million of property and equipment 
we received million from the sale of property and equipment associated with our joint ventures 
in  we received cash from financing activities mostly from borrowings under our credit facility 
in  cash provided by operating activities came from income before asset impairment and restructuring expenses  depreciation and amortization  and other charges of million and a million decrease in trade accounts receivable  which were partially offset by a million decrease in other liabilities 
although accounts receivable decreased during the period  we anticipate accounts receivable will increase as we continue to grow  which may require additional financing 
in  we used cash for investing activities mostly to purchase million of property and equipment  and we invested million in a joint venture in india 
in  we used cash for financing activities mostly to repay million of capital lease obligations 
in  cash provided by operating activities consisted mostly of income before non cash expenses of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities 
in  we used cash for investing activities mostly to purchase million of property and equipment 
this was partially offset by million of cash proceeds we received from sales of property and equipment 
in  we used cash for financing activities to repay million of debt and capital lease obligations  net of additional borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility  resulting in net repayments of million 
capital resources we have historically used funds generated from operations  leases of property and equipment  equity capital  senior subordinated notes  and borrowings under credit facilities with banks to finance business acquisitions  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
effective december   we closed a three year million revolving credit facility 
this new facility replaced our previous million long term senior secured credit facility which was due to expire in april the new credit facility is secured by accounts receivable in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
we intend to utilize the facility  as needed  for ongoing working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
at december   we had million of available borrowings under the new credit facility  and we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the facility 
we expect to finance our current operations  planned capital expenditures  and internal growth for the foreseeable future using funds generated from operations  existing cash  leases of property and equipment  and the funds available under our credit facility 
we estimate that our capital expenditures will range from to million 
future acquisitions  if any  may require additional debt or equity financing 
under a stock repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in february  we may repurchase up to million of our shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  depending on general business and market conditions 
through the date of this report  we had repurchased a total of  shares at a total cost of million 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations and commitments that are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we summarize our contractual obligations and commitments at december  in the following table year long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total in thousands thereafter    total     we generally do not make unconditional  non cancelable purchase commitments 
we enter into purchase orders in the normal course of business  but these purchase obligations do not exceed one year 
other matters quarterly results and seasonality we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  quarterly variations in our results of operations mostly due to the timing of our clients customer relationship management initiatives and customer acquisition and loyalty campaigns  the commencement and terms of new contracts  revenue mix  the timing of additional operating  selling  and administrative expenses to support new business  and the timing of recognition of incentive fees 
we experience periodic fluctuations in our results of operations related to both the start up costs associated with expansion and the implementation of clients crm activities 
in addition  our business generally tends to be slower in the third quarter due to summer holidays in europe 
effects of inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations 
however  there can be no assurance that inflation will not have a material effect on our operations in the future 
accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
on january  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus on the accounting for revenues in transactions that involve multiple deliverables 
the guidance governs how to identify whether goods or services or both  that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement  should be accounted for separately 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   so we expect to adopt the guidance in our financial statements for the quarter ended march  we have not yet determined the impact of this conclusion on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  and are included in the notes to these consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
the interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after january  the application of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
reclassifications we have reclassified certain prior period amounts for comparative purposes 
these reclassifications did not affect consolidated net income for the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated primarily with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have operations in many parts of the world  however  both revenues and expenses of those operations are typically denominated in the currency of the country of operations  providing a natural hedge 
from time to time  we enter into certain hedging transactions designed to hedge foreign currency exchange risk related to short term intercompany loans and specific foreign currency transactions  however the amounts involved have not been material 
we are also exposed to changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings 
interest rates on our senior subordinated notes and capital lease obligations are fixed  but rates on borrowings under our bank credit facility are variable 
during the year ended december   our average borrowings under our bank credit facility were million 
based on our projected cash needs for the foreseeable future  we do not expect that our exposure to changes in interest rates will have a material impact on our interest expense
