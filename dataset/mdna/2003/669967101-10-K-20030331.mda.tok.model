overview of the company s operations we develop  market and support speech software products for automating interactions over the telephone for a range of industries and applications 
our products and services include speech recognition software  which is used to recognize what a person says  deliver responses and information and perform transactions  text to speech synthesis software  which converts text  for example  from a database  email or web page into an audio signal to deliver speech over the telephone  voice authentication software  which is used to provide secure access to information by verifying the identity claims of speakers by the unique qualities of their voices  grammars  which define the dictionary of possible caller responses for use in applications  and a standards based software platform designed as a foundation for speech application deployment and management 
in  we plan to add certain applications for key industries which will be designed to leverage the features inherent in our engines and platform while reducing deployment time and cost 
we seek to actively support both emerging industry standards as well as proprietary development environments 
our software is designed to work with voice extensible markup language referred to in this document as voicexml the recognized industry standard language for the creation of voice driven products and services 
we also offer a range of consulting  support and education services that enable our customers and channel partners to develop voice driven applications that use our software products 
we sell our products both directly through our sales force and indirectly through third party resellers 
we sell our products to customers in the united states  canada  the united kingdom and other countries in europe  china primarily hong kong and other countries in asia  australia  central america and latin america 
we anticipate that markets outside of the united states will continue to represent a meaningful portion of total future revenue 
we intend to continue to support sales and marketing activities with respect to international licensing of our software and provision of our services 
overview of operations our growth and profitability are heavily dependent upon global economic conditions and demand for information technology 
our growth has traditionally been fueled by the telecommunications and financial services industries 
both industries have sustained dramatic slowdowns over the past several quarters 
information technology spending remains depressed and may continue to lag for the foreseeable future 
in response to the challenging business environment  we are evolving our strategic direction in a way that we believe will improve our business performance 
our strategic objectives include focusing resources on geographic and industry targets believed to have the highest potential for revenue  developing a new voice platform and applications designed to increase the speed and ease of deployment and reduce the total cost of ownership of speech systems  developing and strengthening a hybrid direct and indirect selling model  and developing advanced speech technologies that deliver customer value and maintain our leadership position in the speech industry 
some specific operating changes have already been accomplished  such as  the restructuring actions taken in the first and third quarters of  and the release of our software platform in early other operating activities  including new products and changes to selling and delivery channels  will continue to evolve over the next fiscal year 
we are making these strategic shifts because we believe that they will enhance our business performance  however  some of the actions we are taking  such as the introduction of new products  present inherent risks 
for instance  we have recently introduced a new software platform and plan to introduce certain new applications 
we believe that these new products will make speech systems faster and easier to deploy  and will create value for our customers 
the success of these products depends upon certain market factors such as information technology spending generally  market acceptance of packaged software applications and industry adoption of voicexml standards 
in addition  we are responding to customers requests to work more directly with them and provide them greater access to nuance s speech expertise across all levels of their speech solutions 
we believe that increasing our direct relationships with end users and delivering more complete solutions will allow us to reap greater value from these sales transactions 
however  this new sales and delivery model may also present increased costs and risks such as increased liability for complete solution delivery  costs and risks of subcontractors  and delays in recognition of revenue due to solution project timelines 
in addition  while we are actively working to maintain productive reseller relationships  certain reseller relationships may be adversely affected by nuance s direct sales activities  which may have an unfavorable impact on revenue from certain resellers 
reseller partners have been and will continue to be instrumental in delivering speech engines  applications and services to our end customers 
we are actively working to maintain strong relationships with our existing key resellers as well as to develop new reseller relationships 
we will continue to focus efforts on fostering a strong reseller channel  particularly to leverage complementary capabilities in order to speed and ease deployment of speech solutions 
we may encounter difficulties or delays in finding reseller partners having such complementary capabilities and or establishing reseller partner relationships with such entities 
in addition  competition exists in the speech technology market 
we believe that our business and technology has the ability to compete effectively  however  the market is relatively new and susceptible to change 
our competitors may be able to develop superior technologies or may combine with each other to leverage complimentary technologies or relationships 
current and potential competitors have may be able to invest greater resources in competitive efforts and or may establish relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their technological and or selling and marketing abilities 
acquisitions in august  we purchased a set of two patents for  the patents are being amortized over the estimated useful life of five years 
total amortization of these patents for is  during  we entered into an agreement with a third party that gives us non exclusive intellectual property rights to text to speech software code 
we paid million for this purchased technology which had been capitalized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the technology has alternative use and was amortized over its estimated useful life of five years 
we amortized million to research and development in the company performed an impairment analysis for the year ended december  the asset was impaired and was written down by million to its estimated fair value based on estimated discounted future cash flows 
for the year ended  we amortized million 
the agreement includes a royalty clause whereby we pay of all net revenue attributable to sublicenses of this technology to a third party for a term of eight years 
on november   we acquired all the outstanding shares of speechfront inc speechfront for approximately million  including acquisition costs of approximately million 
the consideration included approximately  shares of our common stock valued at million and cash of approximately million 
the purchase agreement also contained additional payments  contingent upon the continued employment of the founders of speechfront 
at the time of acquisition  we expensed million of purchased in process research and development 
other purchased intangible assets  including goodwill and workforce of approximately million were being amortized a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of thirty six and eighteen months  respectively 
we recorded amortization expense of million and million for the year ending december  and  respectively 
for the year ending december   we evaluated the carrying value of the assets related to the speechfront acquisition and recorded an asset impairment of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and asset impairment fiscal year in april  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan that was intended to align our expenses with revised anticipated demand and create a more efficient organization 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we recorded a restructuring charge of million for lease loss and severance costs and an asset impairment charge of million on tenant improvements during the quarter ended june  the company decreased the asset impairment charge by million in the quarter ended december in connection with the restructuring plan  we decided not to occupy a new leased facility 
this decision has resulted in a lease loss of million for the year ended december   comprised of a sublease loss  broker commissions and other facility costs 
to determine the sublease loss  the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing the building  certain assumptions were made related to the time period over which the building will remain vacant sublease terms sublease rates 
we established the reserves at the low end of the range of estimable cost against outstanding commitments  net of estimated future sublease income 
these estimates were derived using the guidance provided in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 restructuring and impairment charges  and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the lease loss would be adjusted in the future upon triggering events change in estimate of time to sublease  actual sublease rates  etc we recorded million in costs for the year ended december  associated with severance and related benefits 
we reduced headcount by approximately employees  with reductions ranging between and across all functional areas and affecting several locations 
fiscal year in january  following board of directors approval  we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our workforce by approximately  or employees 
the restructuring was primarily to realign the sales and professional services organizations 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million for the three months ended march   consisting primarily of payroll and related expenses associated with reducing headcount 
this amount was paid out as of december  in august  with board of directors approval  we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our worldwide workforce by approximately  or employees  to realign our expense structure with near term market opportunities 
in connection with the reduction of workforce  we recorded a charge of million primarily for severance and related employee termination costs 
as of december   approximately million of this amount was paid out  with the remainder to be paid by the first quarter of the plan included the consolidation of facilities through the closing of excess international offices which resulted in a charge of million 
in addition  we recorded an increase in our previously reported real estate restructuring accrual related to the new leased facility we do not occupy and which has not been subleased as a result of continued declines in local sub lease rates in san mateo county  california 
this additional charge of million resulted from the analysis of the time period of which the san mateo property will remain vacant  sub lease terms and sub lease rates  reflecting continued softening of the local real estate market 
the restructuring charges and year end balances for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands lease loss severance related asset write down total restructuring plan total charges for the year ending december  amount utilized in the year ending december  accrual balance at december  total charges for the year ending december  amount utilized in the year ended december  balance at december  current restructuring accrual long term restructuring accrual q plan total charges for the year ending december  amount utilized in the year ending december  balance at december  current restructuring accrual long term restructuring accrual q plan total charges for the year ending december  amount utilized in the year ending december  balance at december  current restructuring accrual long term restructuring accrual total restructuring accrual current total restructuring accrual long term we expect the total cash outlay for the restructuring plans is expected to be million  of which million was paid through december  and million remains accrued at december  we expect million of the lease loss to be paid out over the next twelve months and the remaining million to be paid out over the remaining life of the lease of approximately years 
we expect the remaining million of employee severance and related benefits accrual to be paid out by march  cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of license revenue consists primarily of fees payable on third party software products and documentation  media costs and inventory write downs 
cost of service revenue consists of amounts paid to subcontractors and compensation and related overhead costs for employees engaged in consulting and training 
cost of maintenance revenue consists of compensation and related overhead costs for employees engaged in technical support  software updates and enhancements 
our operating expenses are classified into eight general categories sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative  in process research and development  amortization of goodwill and workforce  non cash compensation  restructuring charges and asset impairments 
we classify all charges to these operating expense categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
although each category includes expenses that are unique to the category  some expenditures  such as compensation  employee benefits  recruiting costs  equipment costs  travel and entertainment costs  facilities costs and third party professional services fees  occur in several of these categories 
we allocate the total costs for information services and facilities to each functional area that uses information services and facilities based on headcount 
these allocated costs include rent and other facility related costs for our offices  communication charges and depreciation expense for property and equipment  computer hardware and software maintenance 
we had full time employees as of december  in april  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan to align our expenses with revised anticipated demand and create a more efficient organization 
as a result  we reduced our workforce by employees 
additionally  in conjunction with the january and august restructuring plans approved by our board of directors  we reduced our workforce by another and employees  respectively  primarily to realign the sales organization  to align our cost structure with changing market conditions and to create a more efficient organization 
we will continue to evaluate our resource and skills requirements and adjust our staffing appropriately 
we may  in the future be required to increase our workforce to respond to changes or growth in our business  and as a result may need to expand our operational and human resources  as well as information systems and controls  to support any such growth 
such expansion may place significant demands on our management and operational resources 
from our inception through december   we have incurred approximately million of operating expenses  including million of restructuring charges and asset impairments associated with our historical restructuring actions 
approximately million of research and development expenditures were used to develop our current and future software products 
costs incurred in the research and development of software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  which usually occurs close to the completion of the software 
once established  these costs would be capitalized 
amounts that could have been capitalized were insignificant and  therefore  no software development costs have been capitalized to date 
as a result of these and other operating expenditures  we have incurred net operating losses in each year since inception 
we anticipate that our operating expenses and costs of service will remain fairly consistent with the fourth quarter of run rates for the foreseeable future 
although we believe we have taken steps to improve the alignment of our expenses with expected revenues  we expect to incur operating losses for at least the next twelve to eighteen months 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as being indicative of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently experienced by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly changing markets 
we have experienced both significant revenue growth and revenue decline in the past 
furthermore  we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future

the increase in license revenue in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to the growth in the unites states and canada enterprise marketplace and adding a range of new telecommunications companies  financial institutions  insurance carriers and others to our customer base 
the decline in license revenue in absolute dollars from to was due to an uncertain economic environment that caused customers to defer purchases or make smaller purchases than originally forecast for service revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to service revenue represented  and of total revenue for  and  respectively 
the decrease of service revenue in absolute dollars from to was due to the decline in demand for these services and the associated reduction of professional service personnel to bring capacity in line with the reduced demand 
the increase in service revenue in absolute dollars from to was due primarily to the recognition of previously deferred service revenue as well as growth in professional services headcount  which enabled completion of more professional service projects 
maintenance revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and an increase of from to maintenance revenue represented  and of total revenue for  and  respectively 
the increase of maintenance revenue in absolute dollars from to was due to the relative increase in license revenue and the associated contract renewal installed base

cost of license revenues was   and  for  and  respectively 
during  we purchased  of third party software to complement our core platform product line 
for the year ended december   we evaluated the third party software and wrote off  of excess inventory caused by lower than expected demand in for the year ended december   we continued to assess the remaining carrying value of the inventory in relation to recovery of future revenues and wrote off the remaining  we anticipate that cost of license revenue will slightly decrease in absolute dollars  but will vary as a percentage of total revenue from period to period 
cost of service revenue consists of amounts paid to subcontractors and of compensation and related overhead costs for employees engaged in customer consulting 
cost of service revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue was  and for  and respectively 
the decrease from to  as well as the increase in services gross margin percentage  was primarily due to a decrease in payroll and related costs of million and a decrease in infrastructure headcount related costs of million resulting from the reduction of professional services personnel during the january and august reductions in force 
further reductions to service costs were attributed to the realignment of certain professional services employees to support the sales and marketing organizations 
these decreases were offset by an increase in consulting costs of million resulting from the use of subcontractors in order to meet the demand of certain customers 
the increase in cost of service revenues from to  as well as the decrease in the service gross margin percentages  was primarily due to hiring additional personnel in the professional services in the beginning of in general  we anticipate that cost of service revenue will increase in absolute dollars due to the increasing professional service revenue  as well as the increasing third party subcontractor costs  but will vary as a percentage of total revenue from period to period 
we may  however  be required to expand our service operations in the future as we continue to evolve with our strategic direction and as a result  such expansion would likely substantially increase expenses associated with professional services and training groups

cost of maintenance revenue increased from to due to increased headcount required to support and train the new and existing customer base 
in general  we anticipate the cost of maintenance revenue run rates to remain relatively constant in absolute dollars but vary as a percentage of total revenue from period to period 
however  this will depend upon our revenue growth  among other factors 
we may  however  be required to expand our customer service operations in the future as we provide more st level technical support directly to end user customers for our new platform and application products and as a result  such expansion would likely increase expenses associated with customer service and maintenance groups 
operating expenses we have reduced costs and expenses to better align resources with revenue opportunities anticipated in the current information technology market 
in january and august  we announced the restructuring plan to reduce our workforce by approximately and  respectively 
we have also reduced variable costs across the company as a result of discretionary spending controls 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing employees and promotional expenditures  including public relations  advertising  trade shows and marketing materials 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing no increase from to and from to sales and marketing expense remained relatively constant from to while there was a reduction of sales and marketing personnel resulting from the january and august reductions in force  the payroll related cost savings were not fully realized until fourth quarter in due to the staggered timing of the international and domestic sales personnel restructuring 
there was also a million increase in incentive based compensation due to the rise in total license service revenues 
however  we expect to realize the full benefit of the reductions in force actions taken in in the coming fiscal year 
trade show expenses also increased by million as a result of our annual v world conference 
these increases were offset by the decrease in spending of travel and related expenses of million and the infrastructure headcount related costs of million 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses from to was attributable to the addition of sales and marketing personnel  which added approximately million in payroll and related expenses  and increases in travel and related expenses of approximately million 
from to  although headcount for sales and marketing personnel decreased from year end to year end as a result of the restructuring plan  payroll and related expenses increased due to the acceleration of our hiring personnel in the beginning of the year these increases were partially offset by a decrease in commission expense of million  resulting from the relative decrease in total license service revenue 
as a percentage of total revenue  sales and marketing expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will decrease in absolute dollars and will vary as a percentage of total revenue from period to period 
we may  however  be required to expand our sales and marketing operations in the future as we develop a direct sales effort in north america and provide sales support for partners world wide  as well as information systems and controls  to support any such growth 
such expansion would likely increase expenses associated with sales and marketing 
research and development research and development expenses consist of compensation and related costs for research and development employees and contractors 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and a decrease of from to the decrease in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to the reduction of research and development personnel from the august and january reductions in force  which resulted in a decrease in payroll and related costs of million 
other factors that contributed to the decrease were the decrease in amortization costs for purchased technology of million following the december  write down of the impaired intangible asset and the decrease in infrastructure headcount related costs of million 
the decrease in research and development expenses from to was attributable to the reduction of research and development personnel  which resulted in approximately million reduction in payroll related and travel expenses 
additionally  the use of external consultants was reduced by approximately million 
as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will remain relatively constant in absolute dollars and will vary as a percentage of total revenue from period to period 
we may  however  be required to expand our research and development operations in the future as we develop and deliver the new platform and application products in as a result we may need to expand our headcount  as well as information systems and controls  to support such growth 
such expansion would likely increase expenses associated with research and development 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related costs for administrative employees  legal services  accounting services and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and an increase of from to the increase from to is primarily the result of the increase in insurance costs 
additionally  there was also an increase in payroll related costs 
while there was a reduction of general and administrative personnel resulting from the january and august reductions in force  the cost savings benefit on payroll related expenses was not fully realized in as majority of the general and administrative personnel reductions occurred late in august however  we expect to realize the full benefit of the reduction in force in the next fiscal year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses from to was largely due to the addition of administrative employees  which added approximately million in payroll related expenses and increased legal and professional fees of approximately million 
the additional expenses enhanced our administrative infrastructure to strengthen controls and accommodate overall headcount expansion in the united states and other regions 
although the number of headcount for general and administrative functions decreased during the year as a result of the restructuring plan  payroll and related expenses increased due to the acceleration of our hiring personnel in the beginning of the year 
as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease in absolute dollars and will vary as a percentage of total revenue from period to period 
we may  however  be required to expand our general and administrative operations and corporate costs for insurance and professional services in the future as we enhance existing programs to meet legal and regulatory compliance 
as a result we may need to expand our operational and human resources  as well as information systems and controls  to support such growth 
such expansion would likely increase expenses associated with general and administrative functions 
acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of speechfront  inc speechfront on november   we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
at december   we reviewed the current value of the recorded assets relating to the speechfront acquisition based on existing business conditions and determined that the voice instant messaging system technologies under development during the year were not aligned with our revised strategy and will not be utilized 
as a result  we impaired the intangible assets and recorded a charge of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
amortization of goodwill and workforce there was no goodwill recorded in the financial statements as of december   as no goodwill was acquired during the year and all previously acquired goodwill was written off in the year ended december  the amortization of goodwill and workforce relating to speechfront were  million and million for  and  respectively

see note 
non cash compensation in connection with the grant of stock options prior to our initial public offering  we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million within stockholders equity  representing the difference between the estimated fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of these options at the date of grant 
this balance is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options in a manner consistent with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of million  million and million for  and  respectively  relating to approximately  stock options granted at a weighted average exercise price of 
for the year ending december   we reversed approximately million and million  respectively of deferred stock compensation and additional paid in capital  which represented unamortized deferred stock compensation relating to employees terminated under the restructuring plans for and in connection with our speechfront acquisition  we recorded deferred stock compensation of million 
this amount was part of the purchase agreement and was payable to the founders in common stock  equivalent to approximately  shares at acquisition date  and contingent upon their continued employment 
of that amount  million of stock  equivalent to approximately  shares at acquisition date  related to retention of the founders of speechfront and was released from escrow on the eighteen month anniversary of the acquisition date  which was may the remaining million of stock  equivalent to approximately  shares at acquisition date  also related to retention of the founders and was released from escrow on the twelve month anniversary of the acquisition date  which was november these amounts were amortized over months and months  respectively 
by may  the speechfront founders had been issued all  shares of common stock 
amortization expense related to these deferred compensation amounts were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in december  we issued a warrant to a customer to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share subject to certain anti dilution adjustments 
the warrant was exercisable at the option of the holder  in whole or part  at any time between january and august in january  we valued the warrant at million  utilizing the black scholes valuation model using the following assumptions risk free interest rate of  expected dividend yields of zero  expected life of years and expected volatility of 
the warrant was fully amortized as of march  we amortized million and million for and  respectively  related to this warrant 
we performed services of  for this customer during  and as a result   was recorded as a reduction in warrant expense in the quarter ended march  and  was recorded as service revenue in the quarter ended june  we performed services of  for this customer for and as a result   of amortization of the warrant was recorded as a reduction in warrant expense for the year ended december  the warrant expired unexercised in august in july  an employee was terminated effective september the employee vested his stock options following termination which resulted in a pre tax non cash compensation charge of million in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
we plan to amortize million of non cash compensation expense in interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  consists primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments 
interest and other income  net  was million  million and million for  and respectively 
it decreased from to and increased from to the decrease from to was mainly caused by the reduction of interest income  resulting from lower cash balances and decreased interest rates 
the increases from to was due to the higher interest income earned on higher average cash balances  primarily the result of cash proceeds raised in our initial public offering in april and our follow on offering in october provision for income taxes we have incurred operating losses for all periods from inception through december  and therefore have not recorded a provision for domestic federal income taxes for any period through december  however  for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax expense  primarily relating to foreign taxes  of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of state and foreign taxes  in which million resulted from tax assessments and associated penalties from the france tax authorities related to tax years ended and in january  we began an appeals process to lower the assessed tax liability and associated penalties 
these foreign tax charges are offset by a benefit of million due to the recognition of research and development tax credits from our canadian operations 
a valuation allowance of million is required for the total gross deferred tax asset for the period ended december  based upon our limited operating history  our lack of profitability to date  and the uncertainty of future profitability at that time 
management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize a deferred tax benefit of million from deferred tax assets 
our income taxes payable for federal and state purposes has been reduced  and the deferred tax assets increased  by the tax benefits associated with taxable dispositions of employee stock options 
when an employee exercises a stock option issued under a nonqualified plan or has a disqualifying disposition related to a qualified plan  we receive an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the option price  tax effected 
a portion of our valuation allowance relates to the equity benefit of our net operating losses 
we had approximately million  million and million of taxable dispositions of employee stock options for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a portion of the valuation allowance  when reduced  will be credited directly to stockholders equity 
quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth a summary of our unaudited quarterly operating results for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  the information has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in management s opinion  have been prepared on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this document and include all adjustments  consisting of only normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and associated notes

the following table summarizes our obligations and commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter operating leases capital leases total contractual obligations other commercial commitments total less than year years years after years standby letters of credit our capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
we may continue to report significant quarterly operating losses resulting in future negative operating cash flows 
we do not plan to spend more than million on capital expenditures in the next months 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  our short term and long term investments will be sufficient to fund our activities for at least the next months 
thereafter  we may need to raise additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion  including increases in employees and office facilities  to develop new or enhance existing products or services  to respond to competitive pressures  or to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
additional funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  we may  from time to time  evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  products and technologies 
we may also consider additional equity or debt financing  which could be dilutive to existing investors 
the restricted cash secures our letters of credit of approximately million invested with a bank  as required by our landlords to meet rent deposits requirements for our leases on facilities 
related parties fidelity investments  one of our stockholders  is one of our customers 
revenues generated from this customer were approximately million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
certain members of our board of directors also serve as directors for companies to which we sell products in the ordinary course of our business 
we believe that the terms of our transactions with those companies are no less favorable to us than the terms that would have been obtained absent those relationships 
in addition  certain members of our board of directors serve as directors or principals of entities that are investors in nuance 
reclassifications and disclosures the company has revised certain financial information presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes as of december  and for the two year period then ended to conform to the fiscal year presentation 
these revisions consist of reclassifications and additional disclosures as follows training revenue totaling million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  has been reclassed from maintenance revenue to service revenue 
assets totaling  were reclassed from other assets to intangible assets as of december  the related amortization expense of  recognized in was reclassed from non cash compensation expense to sales and marketing expense 
the company adopted emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  beginning january  and comparative financial statements for prior periods have been reclassified to comply with the guidance 
the effect of this reclassification was an increase in maintenance and other revenue and an increase in cost of service expense of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas beginning january  as described in note  the and financial statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by sfas these disclosures provide a reconciliation of adjusted net loss to reported net loss and the related loss per share amounts 
additionally  the company has provided disaggregated disclosures relating to the components comprising restructuring and asset impairments  in notes and  respectively  the components comprising cost of service revenue and cost of maintenance revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and the quarterly results of operations 
also  the company has provided disaggregated disclosures relating to the components comprising deferred tax asset and income tax provision in note critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
such estimates include uncollectible accounts receivable  restructuring accrual for leases  taxes and contingencies 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by management 
those policies are as follows revenue recognition  restructuring and impairment charges  valuation allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  valuation of long lived assets 
revenue recognition revenues are generated from licenses  services and maintenance 
all revenues generated from our worldwide operations are reviewed at our corporate headquarters  located in the united states 
we apply the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
we also recognize some revenue based on sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
our license revenue consists of license fees for our software products 
the license fees for our software products are calculated using two variables  one of which is the estimated maximum number of simultaneous end user connections or ports to an application running on our software and the other of which is the value attributed to the functional use of the software 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software and corresponding authorization codes have been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we use a signed contract and purchase order or royalty report as evidence of an arrangement for license orders 
delivery is accomplished through electronic distribution of the authorization codes or keys 
the software was previously delivered to the customer either electronically or on a cd rom 
occasionally the customer will require that we secure their acceptance of the system in addition to the delivery of the keys 
such acceptance  when required  typically consists of a demonstration to the customer that  upon implementation  the software performs in accordance with specified system parameters  such as recognition accuracy or task completion rates 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we assess collectibility of the transaction based on a number of factors  including the customer s past payment history and its current financial position 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer recognition of the revenue until the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of the cash payment 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price generally charged when the element is sold separately  or if not yet sold separately  is established by authorized management 
in situations where vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for an undelivered elements does not exist  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized when fair value can be established for all undelivered elements or when all such elements are delivered 
in situations where the only undelivered element is maintenance and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance does not exist  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
as a general rule  license revenue from resellers is recognized when product has been sold through to an end user and such sell through has been reported to the company 
however  certain reseller agreements include time based provisions by which the company recognizes revenue 
the timing of license revenue recognition is affected by whether we perform consulting services in the arrangement and the nature of those services 
in the majority of cases  we either perform no consulting services or we perform standard implementation services that are not essential to the functionality of the software 
when we perform consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize both license and consulting revenue utilizing contract accounting based on the percentage of the consulting services that have been completed 
this calculation is done in conformity with sop  however judgment is required in determining the percentage of the project that has been completed 
such contracts were insignificant for the company is also exploring potential markets for complete speech solutions  delivered through combined product and services  which we expect to require contract accounting based upon percentage of completion 
this method of accounting is subject to certain judgments by the company regarding amount of revenue allocated to percentage of work completed 
typically  we would recognize revenue based upon the proportional level of effort expended  combined with the value of the technology delivered  to complete certain milestones defined in the customer contract or statement of work 
service revenue consists of revenue from providing consulting  training and other revenue 
other revenue consists primarily of reimbursements for consulting out of pocket expenses incurred  in accordance with the eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
for services revenue  we generally require a signed contract  statement of work and purchase order prior to recognizing any services revenue 
our consulting service contracts are bid either on a fixed fee basis or on a time and materials basis 
for a fixed fee contract  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
for time and materials contracts  we recognize revenue as services are performed 
training service revenue is recognized as services are performed 
losses on service contracts  if any  are recognized as soon as such losses become known 
maintenance revenue consists of fees for providing technical support and software upgrades 
we generally require a signed contract and purchase order prior to recognizing any maintenance revenue 
we recognize all maintenance revenue ratably over the contract term 
customers have the option to purchase or decline maintenance agreements at the time of the license purchase 
if maintenance is declined  a reinstatement fee is required to later activate maintenance 
customers have the option to renew or decline maintenance agreements annually during the contract term 
our standard payment terms are net to days from the date of invoice 
thus  a significant portion of our accounts receivable balance at the end of a quarter is primarily comprised of revenue from that quarter 
we record deferred revenue primarily as a result of payments from customers received in advance of recognition of revenue 
as of december  and  deferred revenue was million and million  respectively 
the deferred revenue amount includes unearned license  which will be recognized as revenue when the appropriate criteria have been met  prepaid maintenance and prepaid or unearned professional services that will be recognized as revenue as the services are performed  or in some cases  when an identified time period has expired 
restructuring and impairment charges through december   we have accrued for restructuring costs when management approved and committed to a firm plan 
historically the main components of our restructuring plans have been related to workforce reductions  lease losses as a result of a decision not to occupy certain leased property and asset impairments 
workforce related charges were accrued based on an estimate of expected benefits that would be paid out to the employees 
to determine the sublease loss  after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing the building  certain assumptions were made related to the time period over which the building would remain vacant sublease terms sublease rates 
we established the reserves at the low end of the range of estimable cost against outstanding commitments  net of estimated future sublease income 
these estimates were derived using the guidance provided in sab no 
 restructuring and impairment charges  and eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
these reserves were based upon management s estimate of the time required to sublet the property and the amount of sublet income that might be generated between the date the property was not occupied and expiration of the lease for each of the unoccupied property 
these estimates were reviewed and revised quarterly and may result in a substantial increase or decrease to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management estimates 
as of december   and the date of this filing  we believe our estimates remain materially correct 
asset impairments primarily reflected write offs of tenant improvements and fixtures associated with abandoned lease space 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and is effective in january valuation allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based on a percentage of our accounts receivable  our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and or expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposures together with assessing tax credits and with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision in our consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  income tax credits  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of the utilization of certain net operating loss carry forwards and foreign tax credits before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets we have assessed the recoverability of long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows according to the guidance of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in we assess the realizability of long lived assets  including intangibles in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we assess the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective in for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangibles  we initiate our review annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future gross revenue  the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these costs and result in a write down of the carrying amount or a shortened life of acquired intangibles in the future 
as of and for the year ended december   we have no goodwill balance and no impairment of intangibles was recorded 
for the year ended december   we recorded goodwill and work force impairments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  must use the purchase method of accounting  intangible assets acquired in a business combination must be recorded separately from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights or are separable from the acquired entity and can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  either individually or as part of a related contract  asset or liability  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually using a fair value approach  except in certain circumstances  and whenever there is an impairment indicator  other intangible assets will continue to be valued and amortized over their estimated lives  in process research and development will continue to be written off immediately  all acquired goodwill must be assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing and segment reporting  effective january   existing goodwill will no longer be subject to amortization 
goodwill acquired subsequent to june  will not be subject to amortization 
because we did not initiate any business combinations after june   the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
had no effect for the year ended december  as all previous goodwill was written off as of december  and no goodwill was acquired in for the year ended december   we performed an impairment analysis of identifiable assets and goodwill and we recorded a charge of million to impair the speechfront goodwill and its related workforce and intangible asset 
as of december  and  we have approximately million and million  respectively  remaining in intangible assets 
in july  the eitf reached final consensus on eitf no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf generally requires that the consideration  including equity instruments  given to a customer be classified in a vendor s financial statements not as an expense  but as an offset of revenue up to the amount of cumulative revenue recognized or to be recognized 
in november  the eitf reached consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf clarifies and modifies certain items discussed in eitf the consensus for both eitf no 
and eitf no 
needed to be applied no later than in annual or interim financial statements for periods beginning after december  we adopted eitf no 
and eitf no 
during the year ended december  and the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
retains the requirements of sfas no 
whereby an impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and develops one accounting model for long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale 
sfas no 
eliminates goodwill from its scope  therefore it does not require goodwill to be allocated to long lived assets 
sfas no 
broadens the scope of apb provisions for the presentation of discontinued operations to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the eitf issued topic no 
d  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
topic no 
d requires companies to characterize reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue in the statement of operations 
we had historically netted reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses against the related expenses in its consolidated statements of operations 
in january  the eitf issued topic no 
d as eitf issue no 
we adopted eitf issue no 
beginning january  and comparative financials statements for prior periods have been reclassified to comply with the guidance in topic d reimbursed out of pocket expenses totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supercedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost  as defined in eitf issue no 
 was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
accordingly  this statement may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
this statement also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for exit or disposal activities  if any  that are initiated after december  and the adoption is not expected to have an impact on our historical results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
fin also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued 
the liability recognition provisions of fin are effective for any guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are applicable to our restricted cash 
as of december  and  our restricted cash was million and million  respectively 
the restricted cash secures letters of credit required by landlords to meet rent deposit requirements for certain leased facilities and is invested in certificates of deposit 
we do not expect adoption of the liability recognition provisions to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure provisions 
we will continue to account for stock based compensation under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees using the intrinsic value method 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the following section describes our exposure to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
this section contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
foreign currency exchange rate risk to date  all of our recognized revenues have been denominated in us dollars and primarily from customers in the united states  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes has been immaterial 
we expect  however  that future product license and services revenues derived from international markets may be denominated in the currency of the applicable market 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
interest rate risk as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments of million 
any decline in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our short term and long term investments 
based upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  an absolute reduction in interest rates of would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income by approximately million
