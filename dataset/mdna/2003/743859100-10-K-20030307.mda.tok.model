item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review the principal objective of this financial review is to provide an overview of the financial condition and results of operations of provident bankshares corporation and its subsidiaries for the three years ended december  this discussion and tabular presentations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes 
critical accounting policies and estimates discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements of the corporation  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates estimates on an on going basis  including those related to the allowance for loan losses  non accrual loans  asset prepayment rates  other real estate owned  other than temporary impairment of investment securities  intangible assets  pension and post retirement benefits  stock option plan  derivative positions  recourse liabilities  litigation and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses  other than temporary impairment of investment securities  asset prepayment rates and income taxes 
each estimate is discussed below 
the financial impact of each estimate  to the extent significant to financial results  is discussed in the applicable sections of management s discussion and analysis 
it is at least reasonably possible that each of the corporation s estimates could change in the near term and the affect of the change could be material to the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses the allowance  which is intended to be management s best estimate of probable inherent losses in the outstanding loan portfolio 
the allowance is reduced by actual credit losses and is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries of previous losses 
the provisions for loan losses are charges to earnings to bring the total allowance to a level considered necessary by management 
the allowance is based on management s continuing review and evaluation of the loan portfolio 
this process provides an allowance consisting of two components  allocated and unallocated 
to arrive at the allocated component of the allowance  the corporation combines estimates of the allowances needed for loans analyzed individually and on a pooled basis 
the allocated component of the allowance is supplemented by an unallocated component 
the portion of the allowance that is allocated to individual internally criticized and non accrual loans is determined by estimating the inherent loss on each problem credit after giving consideration to the value of underlying collateral 
management emphasizes loan quality and close monitoring of potential problem credits 
credit risk identification and review processes are utilized in order to assess and monitor the degree of risk in the loan portfolio 
the corporation s lending and credit administration staff are charged with reviewing the loan portfolio and identifying changes in the economy or in a borrower s circumstances which may affect the ability to repay debt or the value of pledged collateral 
a loan classification and review system exists that identifies those loans with a higher than normal risk of uncollectibility 
each commercial loan is assigned a grade based upon an assessment of the borrower s financial capacity to service the debt and the presence and value of collateral for the loan 
for portfolios such as consumer loans  commercial business loans and loans secured by real estate  the determination of the allocated allowance is conducted at an aggregate  or pooled  level 
each quarter  twelve month rolling loss rates for homogenous pools of loans in the consumer portfolio provide the basis for the allocated reserve 
historical loss rates also provide the basis for reserves allocated to pools within the commercial portfolios 
for any portfolio where the bank lacks sufficient historic experience  industry loss rates are used 
if recent history is not deemed to reflect the inherent losses existing within a portfolio  older historic loss rates during a period of similar economic or market conditions are used 
the bank s credit administration group adjusts the indicated loss rates based on qualitative factors 
factors that are considered in adjusting loss rates include risk characteristics  credit concentration trends and general economic conditions  including job growth and unemployment rates 
for commercial and real estate portfolios  additional factors include the level and trend of watched and criticized credits within those portfolios  commercial real estate vacancy  absorption and rental rates  and the number and volume of syndicated credits  construction loans  speculative construction loans or other portfolio segments deemed to carry higher levels of risk 
upon completion of the qualitative adjustments  the overall allowance is allocated to the components of the portfolio based on the adjusted loss factors 
the unallocated component of the allowance exists to mitigate the imprecision inherent in management s estimates of expected credit losses and includes its judgmental determination of the amounts necessary for concentrations  economic uncertainties and other subjective factors that may not have been fully considered in the allocated allowance 
the relationship of the unallocated component to the total allowance may fluctuate from period to period 
although management has allocated the majority of the allowance to specific loan categories  the evaluation of the allowance is considered in its entirety 
lending management meets at least monthly to review the credit quality of the loan portfolios and at least quarterly with executive management to evaluate the allowance 
the corporation has an internal risk analysis and review staff that continuously reviews loan quality and reports the results of its reviews to executive management and the board of directors 
such reviews also assist management in establishing the level of the allowance 
management believes that it uses the best information available to make determinations about the allowance and that it has established its existing allowance in accordance with gaap 
if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making determinations  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be affected 
because events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases to the allowance will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
the bank is examined annually by the fdic and  accordingly  as part of this exam  the allowance is reviewed for adequacy utilizing specific guidelines 
based upon their review  the regulators may from time to time require reserves in addition to those previously provided 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  in addition to the reasons underlying the decline  to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent 
it indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value are not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to  or greater than  the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
asset prepayment rates the corporation purchases amortizing loan pools and investment securities in which the underlying assets are residential mortgage loans subject to prepayments 
the actual principal reduction on these assets varies from the expected contractual principal reduction due to principal prepayments resulting from borrowers elections to refinance the underlying mortgages based on market and other conditions 
the purchase premiums and discounts associated with these assets are amortized or accreted to interest income over the estimated life of the related assets 
the estimated life is calculated by projecting future prepayments and the resulting principal cash flows until maturity 
management makes prepayment rate projections by utilizing actual prepayment speed experience and available market information on like kind instruments 
the assumed prepayment rates form the basis for income recognition of premiums or discounts on the related assets 
changes in prepayment estimates may cause the earnings recognized on these assets to vary over the term that the assets are held  creating volatility in the net interest margin 
prepayment rate assumptions are monitored and updated monthly to reflect actual activity and the most recent market projections 
income taxes the corporation accounts for income taxes under the asset liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period indicated by the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when in the judgment of management  it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become realizable 
the judgment about the level of future taxable income is dependent to a great extent on matters that may  at least in part be beyond the bank s control 
it is at least reasonably possible that management s judgment about the need for a valuation allowance for deferred taxes could change in the near term 
financial condition at december   total assets were billion 
although total assets are unchanged from december   the corporation has continued to be successful in one of its key strategies to migrate the composition of the balance sheet to include a greater mix of more profitable core loans and deposits 
the corporation continued to experience steady growth in all of its markets  with the expansion areas of northern virginia and the maryland suburbs of washington dc continuing to post strong growth 
asset composition the following table summarizes the composition of the bank s average earning assets for the periods indicated 
average earning assets summary dollars in thousands year ended december  variance variance investments    other earning assets    core loans consumer    commercial business    real estate    total core loans    non core loans consumer    national syndicated loans    total non core loans    total loans    total earning assets    total average earning assets declined by million to billion in compared to a decrease of million in average non core loan balances was partially offset by a million increase in average investment portfolio balances and a million increase in average core loan balances 
the million growth in the investment portfolio average balances in was primarily due to management s actions to reinvest the excess cash flow generated by the non core loan portfolio payments  net of core loan funding requirements  into the investment portfolio 
most of the million was invested in a combination of year conventional mbs and ginnie mae year arms 
allocation changes were made in to contain prepayment exposure in the mbs portfolio and reduce credit exposure in the corporate bond portfolio 
in the mbs portfolio  short duration cmos were reduced by million and replaced with a combination of year and year arms  which are less prepayment sensitive 
million of to year corporate bonds were also replaced with year arms 
included in the corporate bond reductions were worldcom securities due to mature in april  that were sold in november for a modest gain 
this followed a second quarter write down of million due to other than temporary impairment 
additionally  million of trust preferred stock securities  primarily single a rated bank debt  were sold to reduce individual credit exposures in that portfolio 
the corporation realized million in gains and million in losses  including the worldcom write down  from the sale of billion of securities from the available for sale portfolio in approximately million in gains were taken to offset additional premium amortization on the acquired consumer loan portfolio as a result of increased prepayment activity during the higher rate mortgage backed securities sold were previously purchased specifically for their potential to generate income in an environment where long term mortgage rates declined significantly 
the corporation s expanded presence in the baltimore washington metropolitan region facilitated the growth in average core loans 
the growth in average core consumer loans  composed primarily of home equity and marine loans  has continued at a strong pace  increasing million in  or  compared to in  the bank initiated participation in an internet based home equity product referral network  which resulted in productive lending activity 
average core commercial business and real estate loans also showed strong growth of million in  or 
average balances in the commercial construction and business portfolios each grew by approximately million  with of the growth coming from the washington metropolitan region 
this growth was partially offset by an million decline in average balances in the commercial mortgage portfolio  reflecting refinancing activity in the planned shrinkage of the corporation s non core consumer loan portfolio  composed primarily of purchased loans secured by residential real estate  was accelerated by the declining interest rate environment in average non core consumer loans decreased million in  or  due to increased prepayments and resultant additional amortization of million in loan purchase premiums 
as a result of management s focus on lending within its market area  the corporation only selectively participates in new national syndicated loans 
the existing non core syndicated portfolio average balances declined in  which was consistent with management s objective of reducing the exposure to these credits 
asset quality the asset quality within the corporation s loan portfolios continued to improve in as a result of increased response and reaction to delinquency trends 
the trends in credit quality reflect the effectiveness of these credit administration techniques 
information with respect to non performing assets and past due loans is presented in the following table for the years indicated 
as shown in the following table  non performing assets were million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the level at december  of the million decrease  million is related to the residential mortgage portfolio  which declined due to more active and concerted delinquency management 
million of the total non performing loans are in the consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolios  which are collateralized by deeds of trust on to family residences 
with the vast majority of non performing loans already written down to net fair value  management expects little further loss 
commercial and real estate non performing assets fell to their lowest levels in several years during the first half of and remained at these historically low levels during the second half of at december   non performing loans as a percentage of loans outstanding were 
compared to at december  although no assurances can be given  management believes that non performing loans will remain relatively stable in the near term 
total past due loans increased million in due to an increase of million in past due residential mortgages 
this increase was caused by the implementation of collection processes primarily aimed at minimizing the migration of residential mortgage loans from past due to non accrual status 
the loans are reflected as past due however  they continue to meet the bank s criteria to warrant accruing status 
non performing assets and past due loans december  dollars in thousands non accrual loans consumer     commercial business     real estate construction residential  commercial real estate mortgage residential      commercial total non accrual loans     renegotiated loans commercial business real estate construction residential commercial real estate mortgage residential commercial total renegotiated loans other non performing assets other assets and real estate owned consumer real estate construction residential  commercial real estate mortgage residential      commercial  total other non performing assets     total non performing assets     past due loans consumer      commercial business real estate construction residential commercial real estate mortgage residential      commercial total past due loans     non performing assets as a percentage of total loans total assets consumer non accrual loans are comprised entirely of credits secured by residential property and other secured loans  primarily purchased loans

in the elevated amount of the prior year s charge offs was related to a review of the acquired loan portfolio in addition to the write down of the corporation s last remaining non performing health care credit 
the following table reflects the allocation of the allowance at december to the various loan categories 
the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any type of loan 
allocation of allowance for loan losses in thousands consumer      commercial business      real estate construction residential      commercial     real estate mortgage residential commercial      unallocated      total allowance for loan losses     management believes that the allowance at december  represents its best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio and that it uses the best information available to make such determinations 
if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making determinations  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be affected 
based on information currently available to the corporation  management believes it has established its existing allowance in accordance with gaap 
because events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases to the allowance will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
sources of funds deposits and borrowings the following table summarizes the composition of the bank s average deposit and borrowing balances for the periods indicated 
average deposits and borrowings year ended december  variance variance dollars in thousands core deposits retail    commercial    total core deposits    non core deposits    total deposits    borrowings fed funds purchased    fhlb borrowings    repos and other    trust preferred   total borrowings    total deposits and borrowings    total average deposit balances decreased million in average non core deposits  which are comprised primarily of brokered cds  decreased million from matured cds that were not replaced 
the bank s average core deposits  generated from the bank s retail and commercial customer base  continued to grow steadily  replacing million of the brokered cds runoff 
excluding average retail cds  which decreased million in  average retail deposit balances increased million in  or 
deposit growth from the commercial sector was particularly strong in  with a net increase in average balances of million  or  in  of which million was in non interest bearing accounts 
at year end  core deposits comprised of total deposits 
average borrowings increased million in average fed funds increased million  reflecting management s intentions to match fund more of the bank s prime based loan portfolio with fed funds 
the bank extinguished million of term fhlb borrowings in at above market rates 
the debt was replaced with a combination of lower rate fhlb borrowings and repos 
the extinguishments generated a million realized loss in  which was offset by significantly lower borrowing costs in which will continue into from the replacement borrowings 
liquidity an important component of the bank s asset liability structure is the level of liquidity available to meet the needs of customers and creditors 
traditional sources of bank liquidity include deposit growth  loan repayments  investment maturities  asset sales  borrowings and interest received 
the bank s alco has established general guidelines for maintaining prudent levels of liquidity 
the alco continually monitors the amount and sources of available liquidity  and the time and cost required for obtaining it 
management believes the bank has sufficient liquidity to meet funding needs in the foreseeable future 
the bank s primary source of liquidity is the high quality assets it possesses  which can be pledged as collateral for secured borrowings or alternatively sold to raise cash levels 
an objective of liquidity management is to optimize the use of this collateral to minimize funding costs 
the bank s primary sources for raising secured borrowings are the federal home loan banks fhlb and securities broker dealers 
at december   million of secured borrowings were employed  with sufficient collateral available to immediately raise an additional million 
by comparison  only million of unsecured funds considered less reliable sources in a volatile market environment mature in the next months 
this excess liquidity position of million is million lower than at year end  but well in excess of projected liquidity requirements for all of additionally  over million of assets are maintained as collateral with the federal reserve as a contingent source of secured funds 
in addition to secured funding sources  the bank has several unsecured sources available 
at december   the bank had available over million of fed funds lines  of which only million were in use at year end 
brokered cds  which typically cost to basis points more than secured funds of a similar maturity  remain a viable funding alternative 
management did not use this source in  in accordance with the bank s strategy to reduce non core funding 
at december   the corporation had million in brokered cds compared to million at december   a decline of million 
brokered deposits maturing in the next months amount to million or  with million maturing in the following nine months 
the unsecured debt markets are also a potential alternative to raise funds  but were not employed in given the bank s ability to raise funds at lower interest rates in the secured funds markets 
as an alternative to raising secured and unsecured funds  the bank can raise liquidity through asset sales 
at december   over million of the bank s investment portfolio was not pledged as collateral for borrowings  and is immediately saleable at a market value equaling or exceeding its amortized cost basis 
additionally  over a day time frame  a majority of the bank s billion consumer loan portfolio of home equity loans  automobile loans  and marine loans is saleable in an efficient market 
commitments to lend funds to customers affect the corporation s determination of sufficient liquidity 
commitments to extend credit in the form of consumer  commercial real estate and business loans at december were as follows in thousands commercial credit   consumer revolving credit   residential mortgage credit   performance standby letters of credit   commercial letters of credit total loan commitments   historically  many of the commitments expire without being fully drawn  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
market risk and interest rate sensitivity the nature of the banking business  which involves paying interest on deposits at varying rates and terms and charging interest on loans at other rates and terms  creates interest rate risk 
as a result  earnings and the market value of assets and liabilities are subject to fluctuations  which arise due to changes in the level and directions of interest rates 
management s objective is to minimize the fluctuation in net interest margin caused by changes in interest rates using cost effective strategies and tools 
the bank manages several forms of interest rate risk 
the simplest involves the mismatch of maturities between fixed rate assets and liabilities 
a second risk  basis risk  exists as a result of having much of the bank s earning assets priced using either the prime rate or the us treasury yield curve  while much of the liability portfolio is priced using the cd yield curve or libor yield curve 
these different yield curves typically do not move in lock step with one another 
a third risk  options risk  exists in the form of prepayment volatility in residential mortgage loans and other consumer loans 
prepayment risk increases when long term interest rates  such as the year treasury note rate or the year mortgage rate  decline substantially 
prepayment volatility complicates funding strategies in which the goal is to maintain a stable spread between asset yields and borrowing rates 
measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process that management performs continually to meet the objective of maintaining a stable net interest margin 
this process relies chiefly on simulation modeling of shocks to the balance sheet under a variety of interest rate scenarios  including parallel and non parallel rate shifts  such as the forward yield curves for us treasuries and interest rate swaps 
the results of these shocks are measured in two forms first  the impact on net interest margin and earnings over one and two year time frames  and second  the impact on the market value of equity 
there are several advantages of simulation analysis over traditional gap analysis 
in addition to measuring the basis risks and prepayment risks noted above  simulations also quantify the earnings impact of rate changes and the cost benefit of hedging strategies 
the following table shows the projected changes in net interest income from parallel shift up or down interest rate scenarios 
these shifts are assumed to begin on february  and evenly ramp up or down over a six month period 
the effect on net interest income would be for the year interest rate scenario linear prime rate annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income no change the isolated modeling environment  assuming no action by management  shows that the corporation s pre tax earnings volatility is less than of net interest income under probable scenarios 
the corporation s one year forward earnings are slightly asset sensitive  which will result in net interest income moving in the same direction as future interest rates 
the corporation maintains an overall interest rate management strategy that incorporates structuring of the investment and funding portfolios  the use of variable rate loan products and derivatives instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings or market values that are caused by interest rate volatility 
in  management increased the fed funds purchased borrowing source to approximately million  to match the interest rate exposure of prime rate based loans  reducing basis risk 
the spread between the prime rate and the fed funds rate has been a constant basis points for many years 
in addition to increasing fed funds purchased  borrowings totaling over million were employed which reset their rates monthly based on the level of long term interest rates specifically  the year constant maturity swap rate rather than short term rates  to offset the effect of mortgage prepayments on asset yields 
the year swap rate declined by basis points in  while the year mortgage rate fell by approximately basis points 
at december   million notional amounts of derivative contracts were employed  including million notional of interest rate swaps to reduce maturity mismatches  and million notional of interest rate caps to protect interest margin from rising interest rates in the future 
capital resources total stockholders equity at december  was million  representing an increase of million  or  from december  the growth in stockholders equity for the year was primarily attributable to million of earnings of the corporation and an increase of million in net accumulated other comprehensive income  resulting primarily from an increase in market value of available for sale securities 
capital was reduced by dividends declared on common stock of million  and by million from the repurchase of  shares of the corporation s common stock at an average price of per share 
the corporation is authorized to repurchase an additional  shares under its current authorization 
the corporation approved an extension of this program in early to authorize repurchases of an additional million shares 
the corporation is a one bank holding company which relies upon the bank s performance to generate capital growth through bank earnings 
a portion of the bank s earnings are passed to the corporation in the form of cash dividends 
as a commercial bank under the maryland financial institution law  the bank may declare cash dividends from undivided profits or  with the prior approval of the commissioner of financial regulation  out of surplus in excess of of its required capital stock  and after providing for due or accrued expenses  losses  interest and taxes 
dividends paid to shareholders in were million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in the corporation is required to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of core capital to adjusted tangible capital leverage ratio and of tier and total regulatory capital to risk weighted assets 
the actual regulatory capital ratios and required ratios for capital adequacy purposes under firrea and the ratios to be categorized as well capitalized under prompt corrective action regulations are summarized in the following table december  december  minimum regulatory requirements to be well capitalized tier leverage ratio tier capital to risk weighted assets total regulatory capital to risk weighted assets results of operations overview the corporation recorded net income in of million or per diluted share 
the corporation s two key performance measures  return on average common equity and return on assets  were and  respectively  for  compared to and  respectively  in the financial results in  represented by increases of in net income and in diluted earnings per share  demonstrate stability and continued growth in the corporation s core businesses  as well as strong asset quality 
these increases reflect the corporation s commitment to produce positive core results by executing the business strategies of broadening its presence and customer base in the washington metropolitan area and growing commercial business in the baltimore washington corridor 
the major components of the million increase in net income were an million  or  increase in non interest income  before net gains  and an million  or  decrease in the provision for loan losses 
an million decrease in net gains and a million  or  increase in non interest expense partially offset these increases 
these variances are discussed in more detail  as follows 
net interest income the corporation s principal source of revenue is net interest income  the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
interest income  for purposes of analysis  is presented on a tax equivalent basis to recognize associated tax benefits 
this presentation provides a basis for comparison of yields with taxable earning assets 
the discussion of net interest income should be read in conjunction with the table on the following pages 
the table analyzes the reasons for the changes from year to year in the principal elements that comprise net interest income 
because of shifts from year to year in the relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities rate and volume variances presented for each component will not sum to the variances presented on totals of interest income and interest expense

although net interest income increased only modestly during the year  there were substantial differences in the components of net interest income  as total interest income declined million  but was offset by a corresponding decline in total interest expense of million 
generally  the changes were due to the reduction of  and changes in mix within interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as the continued downward movement in interest rates 
the yield on earning assets was in  compared to in  a decline of basis points  reflecting the general decline in interest rates in of the million decrease in total interest income  million was attributable to rate  with the remaining difference of million attributable to the million decrease in earning assets discussed above 
the refinancing boom that accelerated prepayments in the mortgage portfolios also resulted in the necessity to increase the amortization of premiums relating to purchased loans  which reside in the investment and loan portfolios 
in  total premium amortization in these portfolios was million  compared to million in  a basis point component in the decrease in yield 
as part of the bank s strategy  gains were taken on securities held specifically to offset the additional premium amortization 
additionally  interest income lost from non accruing loans was million in  compared to million in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities declined basis points to in  versus in the changes in deposit mix  from higher rate non core and retail cds into lower rate core deposits  had a favorable impact on interest expense of million 
interest expense on borrowings decreased million in  reflecting the general decline in interest rates over the past twelve months 
as a result of derivative transactions undertaken to mitigate the affect of interest rate risk on the bank  interest income decreased by thousand and interest expense decreased by million  for a total increase of million in net interest income for the year ending december  future growth in net interest income will depend upon consumer and commercial loan demand  growth in deposits and the general level of interest rates 
provision for loan losses the corporation continued to emphasize quality underwriting as well as aggressive management of charge offs and potential problem loans 
as a result  the provision for loan losses was million in  down from million in the decrease in the provision resulted from lower charge offs and a decline in loan balances of million 
this was partially offset by the impact of an overall increase in the allowance of basis points as compared to total loans  based upon the analytical process described previously 
net charge offs were million in compared to million in of the million decrease in net charge offs for  million related to decreases relating to the acquired consumer loan portfolio and million related to commercial loans 
both portfolios experienced an improvement in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans in their respective portfolios

branch banking fee income generated in the washington region increased in commissions and fees were similar to the prior year  and were primarily generated from provident investment center  inc  which offers annuities and mutual funds through an affiliation with a securities broker dealer as well as property and casualty insurance products  as agent 
loan fees and other non interest income had slight increases  due primarily to increased prepayment fees generated on early loan payoffs
