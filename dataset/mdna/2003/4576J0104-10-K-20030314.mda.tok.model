allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company has not recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts 
substantially all of the company s receivables at december  and were comprised of rent due from the lessees under the percentage leases rent  which were fully paid in january and  respectively 
historically  the company has not experienced any losses on the lessees receivables 
however  the lessees rely primarily on cash flow from their operation of the hotels to pay rent  and collection of future receivables from the lessees  therefore  cannot be assured 
long lived assets 
hotel properties are depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue 
the company reviews its hotel properties for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the value of the assets on our books may not be fully recoverable 
the company reviewed each of its hotel properties at december  for impairment and  based on its estimate of each hotel s future undiscounted cash flows  determined that an impairment existed on one of its hotels at december  the company recorded an impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter on this hotel 
if the company s estimate of the future cash flows of the remaining hotels were to decrease in future periods  the company may be required to recognize further impairment charges in such periods and the impairment charges may be significant 
the company classified the summerfield suites by wyndham hotel located in west hollywood  ca as held for sale at december  held for sale properties are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
based on this criteria  the company recognized a loss of  for the year ended december  on this hotel 
the sale of this hotel closed on july  and the company recognized a gain on the sale of this hotel of  in the third quarter due to the expenses of the sale being less than expected

the actual loss that may be incurred on the sale of this hotel may be more or less than the estimated loss based on the final sales price and or the actual costs incurred during the sales process 
the company ceased recording depreciation on this hotel in reit qualification tests 
the company is subject to numerous operational and organizational requirements to maintain its reit status 
based on tests performed by management for the years ended december  and  the company believes that it satisfied the requirements needed to maintain its reit status 
however  the company is subject to audit and if the taxing authorities determined that the company failed one or more of these tests  the company could lose its reit status 
if the company did not qualify as a reit  its income would become subject to federal and state income taxes  which would be substantial  and the resulting adverse effects on the company s results of operations  liquidity and amounts distributable to shareholders would be material 
accrual for certain litigation settlements and costs 
in may  the company s former chief operating officer who is a minority shareholder in certain of the ih lessee entities filed suit against the company  the ih lessee and mr 
fisher 
the suit alleges that he was wrongfully terminated by the company in breach of his employment contract with the company and also alleges various other related claims against the company  the ih lessee and mr 
fisher 
in december  the company and  at the same time  the ih lessee and mr 
fisher entered into a settlement agreement with the former officer that is contingent upon the closing of a trs transaction as described in business general potential transaction involving the ih lessee s lease position above 
under the settlement  the company agreed to pay the former officer million in cash and vest  unvested restricted common shares  which resulted in a non cash charge of million 
the company also agreed to purchase the plaintiff s  restricted shares  at his option  upon closing of a trs transaction at the then current market price

liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of liquidity is rent payments from the lessees under the percentage leases  and the company is dependent on the lessees to make such payments to provide cash for debt service  distributions  capital expenditures at its hotels  and working capital 
the company does not expect that its cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to meet all of its liquidity and capital expenditure needs 
the company currently expects to fund any liquidity or capital expenditure shortfall and its external growth objectives primarily by borrowing on its line of credit or other facilities  exchanging equity for hotel properties or possibly accessing the capital markets if market conditions permit

the summerfield lessee leases six of the hotels that are not leased by the ih lessee  under percentage leases 
the obligations of the summerfield lessee under its percentage leases and related agreements are collateralized by  in irrevocable letters of credit  one of which is pledged to a lender to the company  and are guaranteed by wyndham 
according to wyndham  it had a net loss for the year ended december  of approximately million 
as a result  we believe that wyndham may be unable to meet its guarantee obligations  and relies exclusively on the cash flow of the summerfield hotels to generate sufficient cash flow to pay rent and satisfy its capital expenditure and other obligations under its percentage leases 
there can be no assurance that the summerfield hotels will generate sufficient cash flow to allow the summerfield lessee to meet its obligations under the percentage leases

management believes that the amounts required to be made available by the company under the percentage leases will be sufficient to meet most of the routine expenditures for furniture  fixtures and equipment at the hotels

management believed these additional expenditures were necessary to meet competitive pressures from

in many cases  the expenditures were also required by franchisors of the hotels  such as marriott s requirements to substantially upgrade and refresh the company s generation residence inn by marriott hotels 
management believes that for the foreseeable future the company will continue to spend more on capital expenditures than it is required to make available to the lessees under the percentage leases or loan agreements 
the extent to which the actual expenditures exceed the amounts required to be made available will vary from year to year  based on a number of factors

inflation operators of hotels  including the lessees and any third party managers retained by the lessees  generally possess the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
however  competitive pressures and other factors have limited and may in the future limit the ability of the lessees and any third party managers retained by the lessees to raise room rates in response to inflation 
in fact  room rates have decreased over the last two years while inflation has been modest 
however  there can be no assurance that these modest inflation levels will not increase in future years or that the company will not continue to be constrained from raising room rates 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a widely used performance measure for an equity reit 
ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  is income loss before minority interest  including any income or loss from discontinued operations  determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains losses from debt restructuring and sales of property and extraordinary items  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing the performance of the company

moreover  ffo i does not represent cash flows from operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  ii is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow and liquidity needs  including its ability to make distributions  and iii should not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for purposes of evaluating the company s operating performance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on its line of credit and other debt 
at december   the company had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately  the company s interest rate risk objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for a portion of its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
the company may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or caps and treasury options or locks to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of its variable rate debt 
currently  the company has no derivative financial instruments 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
approximately of the company s outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of at december  the company regularly reviews interest rate exposure on its outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
for debt obligations outstanding at december   the following table presents principal repayments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in thousands thereafter total fairvalue debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december  and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the future period  prevailing interest rates  and the company s hedging strategies at that time 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s financing requirements 
the company s line of credit  which currently has no outstanding borrowings under it  matures in july all of our other debt matures in or thereafter
