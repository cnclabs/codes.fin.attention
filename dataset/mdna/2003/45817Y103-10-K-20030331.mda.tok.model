the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we derive our revenue from two primary sources product sales from cd s  cassettes  or books  and copyright revenue from third party use of our product masters and song catalog 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized when delivery has occurred and at the time title passes to the customer 
for direct to consumers product sales that allow a trial or acceptance period  title is not deemed to have passed nor revenue recognized until the acceptance periods have expired 
generally  these acceptance periods are fifteen days after receipt of product 
provisions for sales returns and allowances are made against revenue in the period in which the related products are shipped or title passes based on estimates derived from historical data 
the allowance is recorded in the period in which the related products are shipped 
the returns allowance is presented  along with the allowance for doubtful accounts  as a reduction of accounts receivable in the accompanying financial statements 
revenue earned from licensing the use of songs or product masters in the company s song catalogs is generally recognized as payments are received from licensees 
if the company has information related to the licensed use of songs that would result in the revenue being fixed and determinable  and collection reasonably assured  then revenue is recognized in the periods in which the license revenue is earned 
allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts specifically  our management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
similarly  our management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of expense recorded if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our accounts receivable balance at december  was million  net of allowances for returns of million and net of allowances for doubtful accounts of  product masters product masters  which include sound and video recordings and print masters  are amortized over their future estimated useful lives  using a method that reasonably relates to the amount of net revenue expected to be realized  not to exceed a three year period 
management periodically reviews the product masters amortization rates and adjusts the rate based on management s estimates for future sales 
in conjunction with such analysis  any amounts that do not appear to be fully recoverable are charged to expense during the period the loss becomes estimable 
the costs of producing a product master include the cost of the musical talent  the cost of the technical talent for engineering  directing and mixing  costs for the use of the equipment to record and produce the master  and studio facility charges 
a significant portion of these product master costs are capitalized costs of the company s resources  both personnel and equipment related  that can be primarily associated with the creation of the product master 
because consumer tastes  which are unpredictable and constantly changing  primarily determine the commercial success of any work  estimates must be made regarding future sales 
changes in management s judgment or estimates could result in different amortization rates  or an immediate write off of the balance related to a product 
our product masters balance at december  was million  net of accumulated amortization of million 
advance royalties and royalties payable royalties earned by publishers  authors  producers  songwriters and artists are charged to expense in the period in which the related product sale occurs 
advance royalties paid are capitalized based on past performance  current popularity or judgments made by management of the future success of the artist author 
these royalty advances are deemed to be recoverable from future royalties to be earned by the artist author 
such capitalized amounts are included as a component of other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
any portion of advances that subsequently appear not to be recoverable from future royalties are charged to expense during the period the loss becomes evident 
the amount of advance royalties and prepaid publishing totaled million at december  the company expects that any royalty advances will be recouped over future sales  however  should circumstances prove otherwise  such amounts would be expensed immediately royalties payable to publishers  authors  producers  songwriters and artists from the related product sale or from the related copyright revenues are recorded in the period in which the revenue is recognized 
royalties payable are reduced for the estimated royalties that will not be paid due to product returns and bad debts based on historical experience 
royalty payments for music products are generally made on a quarterly basis  days after the end of a quarter 
royalty payments to publishers  authors and literary agents for book products are generally made in six month cycles  to days after the close of a period 
the amount of royalties payable totaled million at december intangible assets in conjunction with the acquisition of m communications  llc on june   the company recorded million of artists contracts as an intangible asset 
this asset is amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining life of the underlying contracts 
the company will review the carrying value of the artists contracts whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such contracts indicate that the value thereof may not be recoverable 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

the songsworship series debut title  shout to the lord  attained gold  platinum and multi platinum certification with sales of over million double cd units 
the success of this launch resulted in record revenues for the company in since the majority of the songsworship sales were generated from time life and company managed continuity clubs  this decline in revenues from songsworship products was predicted and anticipated

sales in the direct to consumer segment decreased million  or  due primarily to a reduction in songs worship sales of million 
sales in the international segment increased million  or  from million in to million in due to the increase in songsworship sales in the united kingdom and australia 
songsworship products were introduced into the international markets after the success was proven in the united states

due primarily to the increase in sales  bad debts and returns were million in  compared to million in gross profit increased to million in from million in  due primarily to the increases in revenue discussed previously 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the songsworship sales to time life and due to an increase in the reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
the gross margin percentage on sales to time life is lower because the company sells the product to time life at a wholesale price 
additionally  time life has no right of return on products sold to them 
the gross profit percentage in the direct to consumer segment declined to in from in the decline is attributable to songsworship sales whose gross margins are lower as the company sells the product to time life at a wholesale price

reclassifications certain of the comparative figures in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy and relative stability in the company s cost of sales 
while inflation has not had  and the company does not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  inflation may affect the company s business in the future 
risk factors our markets are highly competitive 
the markets for christian music  books and related products are highly competitive 
we face competition from other record companies  music publishers  book publishers  entertainment companies and multimedia companies that seek to offer recorded music  video products  software  printed music and books to the public 
many of these competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have significantly longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than us 
this provides them with the ability to launch more new products  spend more on marketing those products  and pay more to artists  authors and songwriters for new music  book manuscripts and songs 
our ability to compete in this market depends largely on the skill and creativity of our employees and their relationships with artists and authors  our ability to recruit and retain new and established artists  songwriters  authors and distributive relationships  our continued ability to attract and retain highly capable management personnel the expansion and utilization of our song catalog  the acquisition of licenses to enable us to create compilation packages  the effective and efficient marketing and distribution of our products  and our ability to build upon and maintain our reputation for producing  licensing  acquiring  marketing and distributing high quality christian media products 
in addition  the future success of our sales and marketing efforts through the internet will be affected by existing competition and by additional entrants to the electronic commerce market 
our business is subject to constantly changing consumer tastes 
our products consist of recorded music  video productions  books and printed music 
each music or video recording  book or printed product is an individual artistic work 
the commercial success of a music or video recording  book or printed product depends on consumer taste  the quality and acceptance of competing offerings released into the marketplace at or near the same time  the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities  general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors  all of which can change quickly 
accordingly  there can be no assurance as to the financial success of any particular product  the timing of such success  or the popularity of any particular artist or author 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to develop recorded music  videos  books  printed music and other content that is interesting and engaging to our target audience 
if our audience determines that our content does not reflect its tastes  then our audience size could decrease  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
our ability to develop compelling content depends on several factors  including the following quality of our editorial staff  technical expertise of our production staff  access to worship leaders  access to songwriters  access to authors 
furthermore  we must invest significant amounts for product development prior to the release of any product 
these costs may not be recovered if the release is unsuccessful 
there can be no assurance that our products will be successful releases or that any product will generate revenues sufficient to cover the cost of product development 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our business is dependent on access to distribution channels 
we distribute our products through a multi channel distribution system comprised of direct to consumer sales  retail sales  international  and license arrangements 
the direct to consumer channel primarily represents sales from direct mail programs such as our continuity clubs  direct response television to time life music  internet sales and sales directly to churches  including through the company s hymnal joint venture 
members of a continuity club receive monthly mailings containing a feature recording  which they may then accept and pay for or return within a specified time 
the performance of these clubs could be affected by a number of factors including the maturity of our mailing lists  such that consumers no longer desire our products and cancel their participation  our failure to expand and revise our mailing lists to include new potential customers  or the inability to secure new mailing lists from which to build ours  our failure to offer new and appealing products to these customers  and increases in the cost of mailing and shipping  or increased regulation of mail order sales 
in addition  our results could also be affected if time life music were to reduce its marketing efforts for the songsworship continuity series on television  or if the consumer popularity of the worship and songsworship products were to decline 
we also sell our products through the internet through our websites www 
integritymusic 
com and www 
songsworship 
com 
revenues from these sites are not currently a significant part of our business 
the future success of on line sales and marketing efforts cannot be adequately determined at this time  particularly due to the short history of the electronic commerce market 
results will also be affected by existing competition and by additional entrants to the market  many of whom may have substantially greater resources than we 
currently  we rely on word s sales force to perform christian retail market sales functions of our music products  pursuant to a contract with them that extends through january also  we depend on a global marketing and distribution agreement with sony music entertainment and its subsidiary epic records for the distribution of our releases in the general retail markets 
in addition  our christian book publishing division depends on the retail and general market sales functions of gl services 
our international area is dependent on our subsidiaries and a network of independent distributors and exporters reaching markets in countries 
our retail and international distribution channels rely heavily on third parties to sell and deliver our products 
we cannot quickly replace these third parties should they fail to perform  nor can we assume their duties in a timely manner 
as a result  the failure by any of these parties to fulfill their duties effectively and efficiently will immediately and adversely affect our results of operations 
should we encounter difficulty with our existing distribution methods  or be unable to further develop our distribution systems successfully in the future  our business  results of operation and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
because spending on our products is dependent on discretionary consumer spending  we are susceptible to fluctuations in general economic conditions 
we believe that revenue from sales of recorded music  video products  software  printed music and books are dependent on discretionary consumer spending 
our revenue will therefore be subject to fluctuations based upon general economic conditions in the united states and the foreign countries in which we do business 
if there is a general economic downturn or recession in the united states or in such foreign countries  general consumer spending in these markets likely would decline  and our revenues may decrease as a result 
we depend on the continued popularity of christian music and books 
we produce records  video productions and printed music in the christian music segment of the industry 
we produce books in the christian book segment of the industry 
our artists and authors are all in these segments of the respective markets 
although we believe that these sectors will continue to grow  consumer taste is unpredictable and constantly changing 
if tastes move away from this type of music and books  and we do not develop any alternatives  we may not be able to sell enough recordings and books to be profitable 
we may have difficulty enforcing our intellectual property rights 
we consider our copyrights  trademarks and other similar intellectual property to be a valuable part of our business 
to protect our intellectual property rights  we rely upon copyright and trademark laws  as well as confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants 
the decreasing cost of electronic equipment and related technology  however  has made it easier to create unauthorized versions of audio and audiovisual products such as compact discs  videotapes and dvds 
a substantial portion of our revenue comes from the sale of audio and audiovisual products potentially subject to unauthorized copying 
similarly  advances in internet technology  such as peer to peer and mp technology  as well as the emergence of file sharing services  have increasingly made it possible for computer users to share audio and audiovisual information without the permission of the copyright owners and without paying royalties to holders of applicable intellectual property or other rights 
these developments may hinder our ability to sell our products through traditional retail outlets  and there can be no assurance that the application of existing law will provide sufficient protection from misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property rights 
there can also be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to others current or future intellectual property rights 
if we were to fail to develop effective means of protecting our intellectual property or entertainment related products and services  or to obtain appropriate relief through the judicial process or the complete enforcement of judicial decisions issued in our favor in the event our rights were to be violated by third parties  our results of operations and financial position would likely suffer 
portions of our business are dependent on cross licensing arrangements 
we license the rights to certain recordings and compositions from third parties for recording and re recording of music to produce compilations and to expand our catalog 
we also seek to license the rights to our recordings and compositions to third parties for a royalty or a flat fee 
these cross licensing arrangements are generally made possible by existing industry practices based on reciprocity 
if these practices change  we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain licenses from third parties on satisfactory terms  or at all  and our business  financial condition and operating results  particularly with respect to compilation products  could be materially and adversely affected 
we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our domain names  which could decrease the value of these domain names 
our trademark rights may not be sufficient to prevent third parties from acquiring or using domain names that infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and domain names 
we currently hold the internet domain names integritymusic 
com  integritymedia 
com  integrityinc 
com  integritypublishers 
com  songsworship 
com  m com  as well as various other domain names 
we do not hold the domain names integrity 
com  integrity 
org or integrity 
net 
domain names are regulated by the us commerce department through a contract with the nonprofit us corporation internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann 
numerous domain name registrars throughout the world have been authorized by icann to register domain names in the 
com  
org  
net  
biz and 
info generic top level domains gtlds 
additionally  every recognized country in the world has been assigned a country code top level domain cctld by the commerce department  and each country is responsible for registration of domain names within the cctld 
icann is currently considering the addition of one or more new gtlds and can do so at any time in the future 
internet regulatory bodies could further modify the rights of current holders of domain names 
as a result  the value of each of our domain names could be diluted and decrease the number of visitors to our web sites  and we may not acquire or maintain integritymusic or other relevant names in all gtlds or in the cctlds of all countries in which we conduct business or intend to conduct business 
our reserves for product returns may prove inadequate 
most of our products are sold on a returnable basis  which is standard music and book publishing industry practice 
we set reserves for future returns of products estimated based on return policies and experience 
we expect that our actual return experience will be within standard industry parameters and our historical experience 
however  we may in the future experience an increase in returns over our established reserves 
if this occurs our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price for our class a common stock to be volatile 
our results of operations are subject to quarterly fluctuations and seasonal variations 
in particular  our revenues are affected by end of the year holiday sales 
in accordance with industry practice  we record revenues for music and book products when the products are shipped to retailers 
in anticipation of holiday sales  retailers purchase products from us prior to december 
in addition  changes in the timing of new product releases can also cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results because of the marketing costs involved in launching a new product and the delay in receiving any sales revenue from the new product 
for example  if releases planned for the peak holiday season are delayed  our operating results could be adversely affected  which could in turn cause the price of the class a common stock to fluctuate 
increases in the costs of cd s  cassettes  dvd s  and paper could harm our profitability increases in the costs of producing a cd  cassette or dvd due to increases in petroleum prices or other costs associated with the manufacture and duplication of cd s  cassettes and dvd s could adversely affect our profitability 
increases in the costs of producing books due to increases in the prices of paper or other costs associated with the manufacture of books could adversely affect our profitability 
although we do not manufacture these products internally  any significant price increase to our suppliers could result in higher cd  cassette  dvd  and book prices to integrity 
we may not be able to pass on these price increases to our customers 
increases in mailing  paper  printing and delivery costs could harm our profitability 
increases in postal rates  as well as in the costs of paper  printing and delivery  could adversely affect our direct response programs 
we generally ship orders by third class mail with the united states postal service  and we rely heavily on discounts from the basic postal rate structure  such as special rates for bulk mailings  sorting by zip code and carrier routes 
any increase in postal rates  paper  printing or delivery costs could adversely affect our profitability 
we depend on certain senior executives who have experience unique to our industry 
our success has been largely dependent on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management 
although we have employment agreements with some of our senior executives  they could still choose to leave integrity at any time 
if they did  we would have difficulty replacing them with individuals who had an equal level of experience in the christian music and related products and book publishing industries 
this could adversely affect our daily operations  creative development and financial performance 
our new book publishing business has a limited operating history 
our book publishing subsidiary  integrity publishers  inc  has a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of its business and prospects  having only commenced its initial operations in august  the prospects for our book publishing operation must be considered in light of the risks  difficulties and uncertainties frequently encountered by businesses in an early stage of development  particularly operations in industries involving many larger and more established competitors 
these risks include our ability to publish compelling and unique christian book content  successfully market and sell our books  and effectively develop new and maintain existing relationships with book distributors and other persons with which we do business 
the ability to attract successful and highly qualified authors and illustrators is critical to our future success 
competition for this type of resource is intense  and authors and illustrators have many options in terms of publisher affiliation 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop relationships with or retain superior quality authors and illustrators  and any failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results 
we may be subject to liability for misuse of users private information 
it is our policy that we will not willfully disclose any individually identifiable information about any customer to a third party without the customer s consent unless required by law 
this policy is available to customers when they initially register on integritymusic 
com website and is also easily accessible on our websites 
despite this policy  if third persons were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate  or if we inadvertently disclose  our customers personal information or credit card information  we could be subject to liability 
these liabilities could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card information  impersonation or other similar fraud claims 
they could also include claims for other misuses of personal information  such as for unauthorized marketing purposes 
these claims could result in litigation  which may cause us to incur substantial costs 
we could incur additional expenses if new laws or regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if these authorities choose to investigate our privacy practices 
while we have implemented and intend to implement additional programs designed to enhance the protection of the privacy of our customers  these programs may not conform with laws or regulations that are adopted 
integrity is controlled by the coleman family 
our chairman  president and chief executive officer  p 
michael coleman  and his family beneficially own  shares of class a common stock and all  shares of class b common stock outstanding 
this represents approximately of the total voting power of all classes of our voting stock 
as a result  mr 
coleman is able to elect all of our directors  further amend our amended certificate of incorporation the amended certificate  effect or prevent a merger  sale of assets or other business acquisition or disposition  and otherwise control the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval 
limited public trading of our class a common stock may result in increased price volatility 
although our class a common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market  the volume of shares traded during any particular period has historically been low 
any sale or purchase of our class a common stock in the public markets that is large in relation to recent trading volumes for the class a common stock may therefore disproportionately affect the market price of our shares 
we cannot assure you that a more active and liquid market for the shares of class a common stock will develop 
our class a common stock has limited voting rights 
our amended certificate limits the voting rights of our class a common stock 
each share of our class a common stock is entitled to one vote  while each share of our class b common stock is entitled to ten votes on all matters with respect to which our stockholders have a right to vote 
both classes of our stock generally vote together as a single class 
the shares of class b common stock are convertible into shares of class a common stock on a share for share basis at the election of the holder 
also  our class b common stock must be converted to shares of class a common stock automatically if it is transferred  except for transfers to or for the benefit of certain of mr 
coleman s relatives 
we do not have the authority to issue additional class b common stock except as dividends or distributions on outstanding class b common stock proportional to dividends or distributions on class a common stock 
the disproportionate voting rights of our class b common stock could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
these disproportionate voting rights may also make us a less attractive target for a takeover than we otherwise might be  and render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal  a tender offer  or a proxy contest  even if such actions were favored by holders of our class a common stock 
holders of class a common stock might therefore be deprived of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over the then prevailing market price 
the provisions of our charter documents and delaware law could discourage a take over of integrity 
our board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock 
our board of directors  without approval of the stockholders  is also authorized to establish the following provisions of any preferred stock voting  dividend  redemption  conversion  liquidation  and other provisions 
the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
further  the issuance of preferred stock could make more difficult  or discourage  a third party s attempt to acquire control of us 
finally  we are also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which may render more difficult a change in control of integrity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is limited to fluctuations in interest rates as they pertain to the company s borrowings under its credit facility 
as of december   the company paid interest on borrowings at either lasalle s base rate or an adjusted libor  plus an interest rate margin 
in the event that interest rates were to increase basis points  the company s interest expense would increase and income before income tax would decrease by  assuming current debt levels are maintained 
this amount is determined solely by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in the interest rate on the company s borrowing cost without consideration of other factors such as actions management might take to mitigate its exposure to interest rate changes 
the company is also exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
the company does not use any hedging transactions in order to modify the risk from these foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations 
the company also does not use financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives
