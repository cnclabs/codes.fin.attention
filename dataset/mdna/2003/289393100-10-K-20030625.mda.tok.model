item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected historical financial data and the financial statements of the company and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
certain information discussed below may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  it can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved 
forward looking information is subject to certain risks  trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results 
among those risks  trends and uncertainties are the general economic climate  costs of food and labor  consumer demand  interest rate levels  restrictions imposed by the company s debt covenants  management control  availability of supplies  changes in government regulation  particularly in relation to lottery rules and compensation  the availability of financing and other risks associated with the acquisition  development and operation of new and existing restaurants 
this list of risks and uncertainties is not exhaustive 
critical accounting policies the company s reported results are affected by the application of certain accounting policies that require subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve estimates that are inherently uncertain and may have a significant impact on our quarterly or annual results of operations and financial condition 
changes in these estimates and judgments could have significant effects on the company s results of operations and financial condition in future years 
we believe the company s most critical accounting policies cover accounting for long lived assets specifically property  buildings and equipment depreciation thereon and the valuation of intangible assets 
additional critical accounting policies govern revenue recognition and accounting for stock options 
property  buildings and equipment when the company purchases property  buildings and equipment  the assets are recorded at cost 
however  when the company acquires an operating restaurant or business  the company must allocate the purchase price between the fair market value of the tangible assets acquired and any excess to goodwill 
the fair market value of restaurant equipment fixtures and furnishings in an operating restaurant is difficult to separate from the going concern value of the restaurant 
most of the value of the equipment is due to the fact that it is installed and working 
the company values in place equipment with reference to replacement cost  age and condition  and utility in its intended use 
intangible assets the company reviews and estimates the valuation of its intangible assets annually based on its third quarter financial statements 
if the fair values of the intangibles were less than their recorded values  an impairment loss would be recognized 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the market for these intangibles is limited and the realizable value will differ from the fair values estimated by the company 
depreciation property  buildings and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line method over their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease  whichever is shorter 
differences between the realized lives and the estimated lives could result in changes to the company s results from operations in future years  as well as changes in the rate of recurring capital expenditures 
revenue recognition the company s revenue is primarily from cash and credit card transactions 
as such  restaurant revenue is generally recognized upon receipt of cash or credit card receipts 
franchise fees based upon a percent of the franchisees gross sales are recognized as the franchisees sales occur 
revenue from the lottery  which includes traditional ticket based games and video poker games is recorded on a commission basis  that is net of state regulated payouts

elmer s restaurants  inc  like most restaurant businesses  is able to operate with nominal or deficit working capital because sales are for cash and inventory turnover is rapid
