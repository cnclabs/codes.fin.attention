item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discussion of the consolidated statements of operations the consolidated statements of operations present lamson sessions operating performance over the last three years 
results of operations net sales declined in by million or compared with the greatest reduction was experienced in the carlon business segment  as net sales were million or lower in compared with almost the entire shortfall was due to the significant decline of over in telecommunications infrastructure related sales 
the electrical product sales in this segment declined only nominally in from as strong residential and utility markets offset declines in commercial and industrial construction 
favorable existing home sales activity  driven by low interest rates  the introduction of innovative new products and the expansion of market share with its largest customers all led to the million increase in net sales in the lamson home products business segment 
this represents a improvement over the million in net sales in overall  net sales for the pvc pipe business segment fell by million or to million in compared with million in pipe volume shipped in was lower than while average pricing for the current year was approximately the same as the prior year 
the volume decline primarily reflects the soft market conditions for both telecommunications and commercial construction projects 
net sales increased by or million in compared with overall  carlon experienced a growth rate of or million for the year over incremental hdpe conduit sales totaled approximately million primarily from the pyramid and ameriduct acquisitions  which were completed in the latter part of the remainder of carlon s product sales declined from levels by approximately 
this decrease was caused by a general economic slowdown  which persisted throughout the year  and continued contraction in telecommunications infrastructure capital spending 
lamson home products had a net sales decline of million  or  in compared with  as home improvement retailers reduced their inventories during the year in response to softness in sales and inconsistent consumer confidence levels 
lastly  the pvc pipe business segment net sales dropped  or million  in compared with pipe volume shipped was up while average pricing declined by approximately from mix has also shifted this year in the pvc pipe business as telecommunications related conduit is down in units shipped  which has been offset by increased electrical conduit shipments  primarily in the first three quarters of the year 
gross margin in was  an increase of over the realized in the largest improvement was generated in the pvc pipe business as selling prices stayed fairly level with the prior year while operating costs and net material costs per pound have declined slightly 
the overall manufacturing utilization rates this year were at compared with experienced in and was almost entirely offset by cost savings from the restructuring efforts at the end of and disciplined cost controls employed throughout the year 
finally  the significant increase in lamson home products sales this year helped the company to leverage their largely fixed cost base  improving the segment s gross margin 
this helped to offset the lower margins in the carlon business segment  which resulted from the continued downturn in telecom related products 
gross margin in was  down from the margin realized in this drop was primarily caused by the margin squeeze experienced in the pvc pipe business  as a continued oversupply of pvc resin in the domestic market has caused pvc pipe selling prices to be down over from a year ago  while pvc resin costs have declined on average for the year 
in addition  the significant mix shift in pvc pipe from telecommunications duct to electrical conduit has had a negative impact on its gross margin 
finally  the company utilized its manufacturing facilities at a much reduced rate  in vs 
in  generating approximately million more in unfavorable manufacturing variances during the current year 
operating expenses were reduced to million  or of sales  in  a million  or  decrease from the million  or of net sales  incurred in approximately half of the reduction in expenses is a direct result of the elimination of goodwill amortization as required by sfas no 
see note b 
the remainder of the decline is a combination of cost savings from the full year effect of reductions in the salary workforce implemented in the fourth quarter of  lower variable selling expenses from the reduced sales levels and tight control over discretionary spending primarily involving marketing programs and travel related expenditures 
these savings were partially offset by increased employee benefit costs including pensions  medical programs  incentive compensation plans  professional fees and higher bad debt expense driven by telecom market bankruptcy activity 
operating income for was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or  of net sales in this improvement of almost is a result of the operating expense net reduction in the current year as described above 
operating expenses in totaled million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales in during the year the company consolidated the selling  general and administrative processes of the two acquisitions to reduce any redundant costs 
in addition  discretionary spending was reduced  as it became evident economic conditions were declining 
during  the company also recorded net gains of million relating to the resolution of the pw eagle litigation  changes in estimates for certain other litigation and environmental liabilities and a gain on the sale of a non strategic business 
the company also incurred a restructuring and impairment charge of million to reduce excess capacity  eliminate under performing product lines and reduce salaried staff of which million was included in cost of products sold 
in summary  the company earned million in operating income  or of net sales  in million  or  excluding the restructuring and impairment charge and net gains versus million  or  of net sales in interest expense has declined by over million in compared with as the company paid down over million in debt during the year  with outstanding debt averaging million in versus million in the company had an average borrowing rate during of compared with in the income tax provision for reflects an estimated tax rate of and net changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance against certain of the company s general business tax credits 
during the second quarter of  the company completed the transitional review for goodwill impairments required under sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the review indicated that goodwill recorded in the telecom reporting unit of the carlon business segment was impaired as of the beginning of fiscal accordingly  the company measured and recognized a transitional goodwill impairment loss of million million after tax 
this has been recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the statement of operations see note b 
the company s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda was million for compared with the million ebitda earned in  an improvement of nearly 
ebitda is a calculation used by management to measure operating performance and is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is not a recognized term under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and does not purport to be an alternative to operating income or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
financial condition the company continued to focus throughout on generating cash flow from improved earnings and working capital reductions 
net working capital was million at the end of compared with million at the end of the current ratio decreased to in from in as accounts receivable and inventory declined by a combined million from lower economic activity and improved inventory control  while payables and expense accruals increased by million primarily from higher benefit accruals required 
cash flow generated from operating activities remained strong at million in after generating million in accounts receivable were million at the end of  compared with million at the end of days sales outstanding at the end of were about compared with days for year end 
the improvement is driven primarily by the disposition of several telecommunications accounts outstanding at the end of and more rigorous credit reviews 
the inventory level at the end of was million compared with million at the end of as a result  annual inventory turns increased from times in to times in almost all inventory categories have been reduced 
however  the largest reduction came in pvc resin and related conduit products for which pounds in inventory were lower than year end while the average unit cost was about higher compared with year end levels 
despite the lower inventory levels  accounts payable decreased by only thousand in from the prior year end due to the scheduled timing of vendor payments after year end 
accrued liabilities at year end were approximately million more than the prior year due to incentive compensation programs and other benefit accruals which reflect higher costs 
the increase of million in other long term liabilities in is consistent with the recording of a minimum liability for defined benefit pension plans due to lower trust asset levels and payments of million made for retiree medical benefits 
capital expenditures totaled approximately million in compared with million in the current year spending was primarily for additional plant equipment to improve efficiencies and critical tooling replacements 
the company has credit capacity available of over million  which is adequate to support its current operational expense and capital spending needs as well as those anticipated for in order to support key operational improvement initiatives  capital spending is expected to return to a more historical average level of million in during the fourth quarter of the company refinanced the mortgage on its corporate headquarters 
the resulting million in additional funds were used to pay down bank term debt 
due to improved cash flow and operating results  the company has decided to defer more comprehensive changes in capital structure 
in december  the new york stock exchange the exchange accepted the company s business plan for continued listing on the exchange 
the company submitted its business plan to the exchange in october in order to comply with the listing requirements of the exchange 
this effort follows a formal notice from the exchange that the company is below the exchange s continued listing criteria of a total market capitalization of not less than million over a day trading period and shareholders equity of not less than million 
the company s plan will be reviewed quarterly for ongoing compliance with its goals and objectives 
the company believes its business plan  when implemented  should achieve the requirements of the exchange for shareholder equity and market capitalization 
at the end of  the company s shareholder equity is million 
the company s total market capitalization  based on million shares of common stock outstanding at a closing price of on february  was million 
application of critical accounting policies inherent in the company s results of operations are certain estimates  assumptions and judgments including reserves against accounts receivable for doubtful collections  inventory costing and valuation allowances and an assumed rate of return on invested pension assets 
the company maintains allowances against accounts receivable and inventory obsolescence and valuation reserves that are believed to be reasonable based on the company s historical experience and current expectations for future performance of operations 
a sudden and prolonged deterioration in the economy could adversely affect the company s customers especially related to the telecom or retail market requiring the company to increase its allowances for doubtful accounts 
a sudden or unexpected decline in pvc resin costs coupled with a slow down in sales volume could result in write downs of inventory valuations 
if such adverse conditions would occur  the company cannot readily predict the effect on its financial condition or results of operations as any such effect depends on both future results of operations and the magnitude and timing of the adverse conditions 
the company s policy of amortizing unrecognized gains or losses in accordance with sfas no 
 the significant deterioration in the stock market and resulting reduction in defined benefit pension plan assets will cause an increase of approximately million in the reported pension expense to be included in the company s results of operations beginning in in addition  the substantial decline in defined benefit pension plan assets over the past nine months has led to the company making a voluntary contribution of million to the company s defined benefit pension plans in the fourth quarter of in order to maintain an appropriate funding level 
management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for environmental cleanup and litigation 
liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of matters such as changes in laws  regulations and their interpretation  the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination  and improvements in technology 
actual litigation costs can vary from estimates based on the facts and circumstance and application of laws in individual cases 
as of december   the company had approximately million of net deferred tax assets primarily related to loss carryforwards that expire through the realization of these net assets is based primarily upon estimates of future taxable income 
current expectations of operating results are sufficient to sustain realization of these net assets 
however  should taxable income estimates for the carryforward period be significantly reduced  the full realization of net deferred tax assets may not occur 
outlook the following paragraphs contain forward looking comments 
the comments are subject to  and the actual future results may be impacted by  the cautionary limitations and factors outlined in the following narrative comments 
both housing starts at million units and existing home sales were very strong throughout and finished the year at near record levels 
low interest rates have allowed the maintenance of this activity over the last several years and supported the sales growth in lamson home products  the electrical product sales in carlon and the pvc pipe business segment 
it is expected  barring an economic downturn that housing starts and home sales will decline modestly in but will remain at historically strong levels 
commercial and industrial construction plummeted by and  respectively  in  and these areas will probably remain weak and at best show only modest improvement in due to the overhang of excess capacity 
the company believes that the telecommunications infrastructure market has bottomed out during we do not expect any demand improvement through as most participants are only maintaining their current systems and holding off on incremental investments in additional infrastructure until absolutely necessary 
we believe also that spending in this market long term will be required  to build out metropolitan rings  expand corporate and institutional high speed data and communications networks and to provide broadband services to the home 
while very little sales growth is anticipated in this market during  many of the weaker competitors have been eliminated and  therefore  the stability of our customer base has improved 
in the pvc pipe business  we expect pvc resin costs to increase throughout the first half of in response to higher oil and natural gas prices and capacity restrictions on some feedstocks 
these should be passed on by the pvc pipe producers as inventory across the distribution network has been lowered 
as pvc resin costs increase  assuming reasonable general economic activity  the margin spreads are generally able to be expanded resulting in improved profitability 
we do expect to build some inventory levels in the first quarter in anticipation of the cyclical construction season 
in summary  we estimate that net sales for will increase by to with approximately half of this improvement coming from a higher price level for pvc pipe products 
the remaining net sales growth will be the result of market share improvement in the lamson home products segment and some general strengthening in our markets as a whole 
despite a significant pension expense increase that will need to be recorded in  we believe  net income should be to above the performance as the result of the implementation of planned customer service and operational improvement initiatives 
our manufacturing plants will enjoy higher capacity utilization as we build inventories  particularly in the first half of the year 
despite this increase  however  due to the completion of several efficiency improvement projects  we expect to reduce inventory and show further improvement in our inventory turn performance by the end of we have experienced improved credit quality in our accounts receivable in and anticipate that it will continue in the expected increase in cash needed for capital spending should be offset by the continued focus on working capital efficiency 
the company expects to have sufficient cash flow for all necessary capital and operating needs as well as reduction in debt leverage in the second half of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains expectations that are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those expected as a result of a variety of factors  such as i the volatility of resin pricing  ii the ability of the company to pass through raw material cost increases to its customers  iii maintaining a stable level of housing starts  telecommunications infrastructure spending  consumer confidence and general construction trends and iv any adverse change in the recovery trend of the country s general economic condition affecting the markets for the company s products

almost all of the company s long term debt obligations bear interest at a variable rate 
in order to mitigate the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations  in the first quarter of  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of million  million outstanding at december   and effectively fixed the variable rate debt at and plus the company s risk premium of to 
the notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flow to be exchanged and does not represent exposure to credit loss 
these risks and others that are detailed in this form k must be considered by any investor or potential investor in the company
