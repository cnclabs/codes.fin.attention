item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
except for the historical information and statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  the matters and items contained in this document  including md a  contain certain forward looking statements that involve uncertainties and risks  some of which are discussed below  including  under the caption cautionary statements additional important factors to be considered 
we are under no obligation to update any forward looking statements in this section 
words such as expects  anticipates  projects  estimates  intends  plans  believes  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
overview we are a leading provider of discovery chemistry  integrated discovery software products  software consulting services  and discovery research services to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  agrochemical  and other life sciences industries 
we combine information technology and scientific research to optimize and accelerate molecular research for the discovery of new products by customers 
our products include proprietary discovery software tools to manage  analyze and share biological and chemical information  systems integration along with other software consulting services  diverse chemical libraries  collaborative and contract research for the discovery  synthesis  characterization and optimization of new chemical compounds that are active in biological systems 
we generate revenues from a diversified offering of products and services 
we derived of our and of our revenues from discovery software products and support  of and of revenues from enterprise software consulting services  of and of revenues from discovery research products and services with the remainder from hardware sales 
in  of software license revenues were attributable to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  with one customer pfizer at representing or more of total revenues 
in  of software license revenues were from pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries while two customers represented more than of total revenues pfizer at and bayer at 
we license software and support in the form of one to three year renewable contracts for any of our more than software modules available for sale 
the magnitude of these license fees is dependent on each customer s required usage levels  that is  the number of locations and individual users 
variations in licensing levels range from the low hundred thousands up to several million dollars and therefore may be sufficient to impact the comparability of quarterly results 
our integration of chemistry and biological data in the life sciences industries creates a revenue stream for enterprise software consulting services 
to serve this market  we maintain a staff of specialists who use our proprietary data integration framework  metalayer tm software  to configure customized solutions for data management 
revenue may be generated on a billable rate per day  or upon achievement of milestones or deliverables and is recognized as services are performed 
these contracts may also generate substantial license fee revenue for our proprietary software technologies such as our metalayer tm and chemcore tm software 
as with our discovery software products  licensing levels may range from the low hundred thousands up to several million dollars and therefore be sufficient to impact the comparability of quarterly results 
we develop and manufacture general screening compound libraries for sale to the life sciences industry 
this has created the opportunity to offer follow up discovery research services to customers for design and synthesis of focused libraries for lead optimization 
we also market a comprehensive research process to our life sciences customers for rapid and cost effective discovery 
this process combines advanced informatics  chemistry and biology products and services  and proprietary discovery technologies for efficient lead development  refinement  and optimization resulting in a tightly integrated process to facilitate synergies in drug discovery 
we also act as a reseller of computer hardware in conjunction with software sales 
hardware sales are generally made to facilitate integration of our software into customer research activities and are not a focus of our sales activities 
we act merely as an authorized reseller and do not maintain any inventory 
accordingly  margins on these sales are relatively modest 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued over time we have invested in collaborative drug discovery programs with arena pharmaceuticals  arrow pharmaceuticals  signase and the wolfson institute 
these collaborations have generated patented lead compounds  several of which are being pursued by our respective partners 
potential benefits of these opportunities are not included in any business plans or forecasts at this time  and all related costs of these program investments have been expensed in prior years 
we license discovery software tools to customers  provide ongoing support including upgrades selected by customers and provide consulting services to customers that enable integration of our existing and newly developed discovery tools to customers discovery operations 
we generally expense research and development costs associated with software enhancements and new functionality 
thus  a significant portion of the costs associated with development and enhancement of software is accounted for as research and development and not as a cost of software sales 
certain software development projects require substantial commitments of time and resources 
costs of these projects are capitalized according to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
quarterly expenses include the fixed costs of research and development for software development and new chemistry research 
we believe that core selling and administrative costs will remain generally consistent as a percent of sales on an annual basis 
variability in quarterly expenses primarily occurs in relation to the level of revenues for sales compensation  bonuses and staffing for selling  general and administrative functions and for periodic marketing activities such as appearances at trade exhibitions 
during and  we applied our capital resources to fund investments in the building of chemistry production facilities  chemical compound library inventories  collaborative drug discovery programs  staffing new business opportunities  and investments in arena pharmaceuticals 
in fiscal year  we used cash available from an equity investment by lion to maintain capital infrastructure  reduce debt levels and conduct operations 
in  we further invested in our sales and marketing staff along with a major expansion of our chemistry laboratory facilities in order to capture additional business opportunities 
our revenues and expenses vary from quarter to quarter depending upon  among other things  the timing of customers budget processes  the success of our sales efforts  the lengthy sales cycle and our ability to influence customers and prospective customers to make decisions to outsource portions of their discovery process  the size of the customers capital expenditure budgets  the ability to produce compound libraries in a timely manner  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of existing products  the timing of new product introductions by us and other vendors  changes in pricing policies ours  partners and other vendors  consolidation in customer base  client involvement in decision points in contracts related to project plans  and changes in general economic and competitive conditions 
in addition  we may negotiate a long term software license contract that may  subject to certain rules of sop and sop  be required to be recognized ratably over the life of th e contract 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of revenue recognition policies 
a substantial portion of product based revenues for each quarter is attributable to a limited number of orders and tends to be realized toward the end of each quarter 
thus  even short delays or deferrals of sales near the end of a quarter can cause quarterly results to fluctuate substantially 
our quarterly results can also be affected by the mix of revenue components 
the variability of the timing  term  scope and magnitude of service based contracts along with our ability to attract additional contracts can have a significant impact on quarterly and annual comparisons 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of net sales  except costs of sales data  which is set forth as a percentage of the corresponding net sales data net sales discovery software support software consulting services discovery research hardware total net sales cost of sales discovery software support software consulting services discovery research hardware total cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense other income expense  net net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss preferred dividends net income loss allocable to common shareholders as a percentage of the corresponding sales net sales 
in  net sales increased to million from million in  which was up over the million recorded in increases in discovery software   and discovery research   were partially offset by decreases in software consulting services   and hardware  
the increase in was attributable to growth in all areas  but most notably in discovery software   software consulting   and discovery research  
we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from the pharmaceutical industry 
net sales to this industry accounted for approximately  and  of total net sales in   and  respectively 
net sales from our activities outside of north america represented approximately  and of total net sales in  and  respectively  with europe accounting for  and  and the respective balances coming from customers in the pacific rim 
we believe that revenues from foreign activities will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total net sales 
list prices for our software products have remained relatively stable over the last few years 
in mid  we began selling token software licenses in addition to term licenses 
a token license includes a minimum level of modules for a minimum total price 
in  and   and  respectively of software license sales were sold in the form of a token license 
as a result of selling more modules through token licenses  the average software license revenue per customer has increased 
increasing net sales from period to period is dependent  in part  on our ability to introduce new products and services  which are accepted by the market  and on our ability to penetrate new and existing markets 
existing customers represented of total net sales in  in  and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued software license sales increased to million from million in after increasing from million in in  discovery software benefited from renewals of significant wide area network contracts such as our contract with pfizer and additional collaborative software development projects 
the increases in over were attributable to increases in software research collaborations and continued strong renewals of term and token license sales 
support sales increased to million from million in  which was an increase of from the million in the fluctuation in support revenue was due to the continued migration away from perpetual licenses to term or token licenses 
in the future  these results may vary due to the three year cycle of term and token license renewals 
software consulting service revenues declined in by to million from million in after increasing from million in the decline in revenues is primarily due to the lack of new contracts to replace completed projects along with the delay of a key milestone on a major contract that reduced our revenue potential from that contract 
significant additional efforts were made in order for the delayed milestone to pass testing protocols in early december the increase in was attributable to the initiation of multiple high value contracts to provide enterprise wide informatics solutions based on our metalayer technology 
during we performed several pilot projects that ultimately led to the major contract work started in and continued in we derive discovery research revenues from our compound library product  leadquest  and discovery contract research services 
discovery research sales increased to million from million in  which had increased from million in the principal reason for the increase in discovery research revenues in was due to our progress on the million four year contract with pfizer  inc to design and synthesize chemical compounds 
s increase over included a substantial portion of our multi million dollar discovery research contract with pharmaceutical company lipha sa and two large leadquest sales that totaled over million of compound revenue 
hardware revenues decreased to million from million in  which had increased from million in we do not aggressively promote hardware due to its low margin  but merely provide access to product as a convenience to customers 
the high end server and workstation equipment that we carry continues to face growing competition from lower cost alternatives 
cost of sales 
total cost of sales increased to million from million in  which was up from million in these costs represent  and of total net sales  respectively 
the increase of cost of sales in was due primarily to the much higher level of discovery research activity plus incremental costs to complete a delayed milestone in the software consulting services area 
for  cost of sales increased due to the shift in the mix of lower cost software products toward higher cost software consulting services  diverse compound libraries and discovery research contracts 
costs of software licenses represented  and of software license sales in  and  respectively 
costs of software licenses consist of amortization of capitalized software  royalties to third party developers  and the cost of software product packaging and media 
the increases in cost as a percent to sales in and resulted from a change in the mix of internal versus third party products sold  thus resulting in higher royalty payments 
costs of software support represented  and of support sales in  and  respectively 
cost of support consists principally of software product packaging  media and updates to documentation 
the costs related to staffing telephone support functions are captured in sales marketing expenses 
costs of software consulting services scs represented  and of consulting service sales in  and  respectively 
costs of scs are direct charges for staff  travel and overhead required to provide the services 
the variability in cost of sales is based on the mix of fees for services and licenses 
the significant increase in the cost of software consulting in is principally attributable to a delayed milestone on one contract along with cost overruns experienced on this and one other contract 
we expensed the anticipated costs to complete the delayed milestone in the second quarter of when it became apparent that we would incur a loss on that specific milestone 
we took a charge in the fourth quarter of to reflect the anticipated loss to complete the remainder of the contract 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued costs of discovery research represented  and of discovery research sales in  and  respectively 
the cost of the discovery research business is represented by the raw material  direct labor and overhead costs to produce compound libraries and to deliver on contracted research projects 
discovery research contracts may also include third party costs for screening or scale up activities 
as a result  variability in cost of sales may be attributed to the mix of compound and discovery research revenues 
in  two large compound orders had the significant effect of lowering the average cost of sales for the year 
for  the pfizer compound design and synthesis contract attributed greatly to the overall cost of sales 
costs of hardware represented   and of hardware sales in  and  respectively 
cost of hardware consists of the direct costs of hardware sold 
we expect the cost of hardware as a percentage of hardware sales to remain relatively stable in future periods 
gross profit was million in  million in and million in  which represents gross profits of  and  respectively 
for  the decrease in gross margin is attributable to the increased amount of discovery research  such as the pfizer compound file enrichment project  along with the cost overruns and delayed milestone in software consulting services 
the decrease in the gross profit margin percentage in was due to the change in the mix of software licenses  software consulting service  and discovery research sales 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million from million in  which was an increase of from million in during  we invested in our sales and marketing organization to expand our territory coverage and promotional activities 
this investment accounted for the increased costs in the current year and was intended to position us for future growth 
the increase in was due to the substantial increase in sales  their related commissions and the marketing costs incurred to increase market awareness of all of our products and services 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in after having decreased from in to in this increase in percent of net sales reflects our continued investment in staffing resources to drive future business 
research and development expenses increased to million from million in  which was up from million in r d costs represented   and of net sales in  and  respectively 
the increased spending for r d reflects additional chemistry staff at tripos receptor research and incremental costs of new collaborative software development projects 
research and development expenses  including the amount of capitalized costs were million in  million in and million in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
and sop  the company capitalizes software development costs for both external and internal use 
tripos anticipates that its investment in new product research will continue to be significant as we develop new software modules each year  work on funded software research contracts with customers  develop new technologies for use in our enterprise consulting work  and pursue novel compound templates for inclusion in our leadquest libraries 
tripos reflects costs to fulfill funded software research agreements in r d to better reflect the uncertain outcomes from these collaborations 
costs associated with researching novel compound templates are classified as r d up until such time as the base reaction is validated  after which costs are captured in inventor y 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million from million in  which was up from million in g a expenses represented  and of net sales for  and  respectively 
the increase in expense in was due to additional worldwide infrastructure and information technology costs along with an increase in bonuses as determined by the board of directors 
we expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively stable as a percentage of sales in the future 
interest income was million in  million in and million in reflecting an increasing average amount of cash on hand year over year coupled with imputed interest income from multi year software license contracts 
interest expense of million in  million in and million in was from interest due on the long term note payable for the corporate building  the line of credit  and interest on capital leases 
interest expense has declined commensurate with the reduction in the average outstanding debt balances 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other income was million in  million in and million in in  other income included million from the sale of  shares of arena pharmaceuticals  inc common stock through a b trading program 
during  we had income of million from the sale of  shares during arena s follow on offering 
income tax expense benefit 
our tax expense in was million and million for we had a tax benefit of million in the effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the low effective tax rate in reflects the release of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of a large portion of our net operating losses from subsidiaries in the united kingdom and current state tax benefits in the us during  we utilized a significant portion of our uk net operating losses and a valuation allowance remained in place for the balance of the deferred tax asset 
the low effective rate in reflects benefits from group tax relief in the uk 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used by operating activities in was million 
the use of funds was attributable to increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  along with decreases in accounts payable accrued expenses and deferred taxes of million and million  respectively 
the gain on the sale of shares of arena pharmaceuticals of million was offset by net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  a reduction in notes receivable of million along with an increase in deferred revenue of million 
in  net cash related to operating activities increased from a use of funds of million in to a source of funds of million 
this was primarily due to net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million along with a reduction in inventory of million and an increase in accounts payable accrued expenses of million 
these improvements were substantially offset by increases in accounts receivable of million  notes receivable of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of million and the gain on the sale of arena pharmaceutical shares of million 
net cash used for investing activities was million in the primary investments were in fixed assets of million  principally at our chemistry laboratories in the uk  capitalized software development costs for laboratory research support systems of million and further investment in a private biotech company along with the techamp ii life sciences investment fund  managed by am pappas  of million as part of our efforts to obtain access to more collaboration partners 
these investments were partially offset by the million of proceeds from the sale of  shares of arena pharmaceuticals 
we anticipate that fiscal capital purchases will be double those in as we expand our laboratory capacity to meet demand 
net cash related to investing activities decreased to a usage of million in from cash provided by investing activities of million in the decrease relates to purchases of capital equipment throughout the company of milli on and an investment in the techamp ii fund of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million 
this funding was in the form of million from the issuance of stock to participants in our stock purchase and stock option plans along with million of debt financing from our credit facilities with lasalle bank 
during  we made payments on capital leases and long term debt of million and paid a cash dividend on preferred shares of million to lion bioscience ag upon conversion of their holdings of preferred shares to common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased from million in to million in in  our stock purchase and option plans generated million while proceeds from capital lease financing of million partially offset payments on long term debt and capital leases of million 
throughout and into  we will be funding the completion of our construction project at our uk laboratory facility 
we estimate that we will pay million to complete the project including building and equipment 
additionally  over the same period  we will fund the remainder of our investment commitment million to the techamp ii life science investment fund 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we believe that with our cash  investments in marketable securities  accounts receivable balances  projected cash flows from operations  availability under our million line of credit from lasalle and abn amro banks  capital and operating leases along with other forms of financing and capital  if necessary  we will be able to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the credit facilities available to us 
due to the capital needs inherent to our business and despite current capital markets uncertainties  we may decide to seek additional financing to support our long term objectives to enhance product development  expand existing markets and enter new markets  expand our chemistry research laboratories  or fund participation in new therapeutic collaborations 
in making decisions regarding access to additional capital  we will consider the availabil ity and terms of financing alternatives  as well as our objective to maintain financial flexibility to support planned and opportunistic growth of our business 
additional capital may be in the form of equity or debt securities  and may be raised in public offering or private placement transactions 
foreign currency translations our foreign operations transact the majority of their business in their respective local currencies and are generally not exposed to material foreign currency gains or losses 
under certain circumstances  selected contracts may expose tripos to substantial foreign exchange risk 
however  due to the relative stability of the currency of the countries in which we operate and the level of investment in each country  our current intent is to retain assets within our foreign operations to fund those operations 
disclosures required under the sarbanes oxley act of on july  president bush signed into law the sarbanes oxley act of the act 
certain provisions of the act are currently applicable to tripos  but many other provisions do not become applicable until future dates 
tripos is currently reviewing the steps that will need to be taken to assure compliance with the act and related requirements of the sec and nasdaq 
section of the act effective for period ending december  requires companies to disclose all material off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations and other relationships 
as of december   tripos had no off balance sheet transactions or arrangements other than ordinary operating leases that are further discussed in note of tripos consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
in prior years we utilized a foreign sales corporation fsc for certain tax benefits arising from our foreign sales activities 
due to recent tax law changes  we have ceased utilization of this tax strategy and dissolved the fsc entity on december  section of the act prohibits any new loans to officers and directors and renewals of existing loans to officers and directors  except in specific circumstances 
during we made a month loan to douglas a 
danne  our then senior vice president commercial operations in the amount of  of which  remained outstanding at december  mr 
danne left the company in late and we are taking steps to collect the remaining amount outstanding

critical accounting policies the following information is provided in order to illustrate which accounting policies management deems to be the most critical in the computation of the financial statements included later in this form k 
valuation of accounts receivable 
due to the nature and credit quality of our customer base principally major pharmaceutical companies  universities and larger biotechs  provision for bad debts is typically calculated on a case by case basis and takes into consideration the age of the outstanding receivable amount by customer  the customer s cash position  and the geographic location of the customer 
historically  we have a very low experience rate for uncollectible amounts 
therefore  management believes that alternative methods for calculating allowances for bad debts such as percentage of net sales or percentage of past due receivables do not reflect our lower experience rates and the specific identification method is appropriate 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inventory valuation 
inventory amounts  consisting primarily of chemical compounds and accumulated costs of discovery research contracts awaiting delivery to the customer  shown in the consolidated balance sheet are net of an obsolescence reserve 
in calculating the reserve  the age and sales trends of each category in the inventory are taken into account to determine the net realizable value 
any shortfall between the carrying cost of the inventory and the net realizable value is provided for in the reserve 
to further reduce the risk of a shortfall between the carrying cost and net realizable value  we provide for obsolescence by creating a reserve provision  whose rate escalates with the passage of time 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of product  fob shipping point  or upon performance of services 
for software product sales under term or token license arrangements  revenue is recognized only when product is shipped  activation keys are delivered  a contract is signed by both parties  and collection is reasonably assured 
the software license component of these transactions is recognized upon the occurrence of the above criteria while the support or maintenance component is recognized over the life of the agreement 
contracts that call for future deliverables or include break clauses have revenue deferred until the deliverable is shipped or the break point has passed 
service contracts discovery research and software consulting have revenue streams that are dependent on the contractual obligations 
that is  for contracts containing performance milestones  revenue will only be recognized upon the achievement of the milestone and acceptance by the customer 
contracts that are non specific as to deliverables will typically be recognized under the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition 
under this method  progress on the contract is measured at regular intervals eg quarterly and the cumulative costs expended are compared to the total projected costs to complete the project 
the percentage of costs expended is then applied to the expected revenue due under the contract to properly match the income and expenses throughout the contractual term 
certain other contracts are billed and revenue is recognized based on full time equivalent fte staff utilization 
that is  the number of fte s utilized on the contract in a given period 
each of these methods relies on estimates of the progress and expected costs to perform under the contracts which may result in adjustments based on actual performance 
valuation of investments in securities 
marketable securities consist of investments in equity securities of unconsolidated affiliates and are held as available for sale 
we account for securities that can be sold within the next months as marketable securities 
amounts presented are the fair values of the investments on the balance sheet date determined using then current market quotes 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded as increases or decreases in the assets value and are reflected in other comprehensive income until the assets are sold 
at december   this category on our balance sheet reflects the market value of our holdings in arena pharmaceuticals  inc in prior years  the remainder of our arena investment was held at its original cost elsewhere in the balance sheet under the caption investment in restricted stock along with other equity investments that were are not readily marketable 
the carrying values of all of the in vestments are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjustments  due to fluctuations in market pricing for arena and impairment for the other investments  are made to reflect the then current net realizable value 
property  plant and equipment 
all assets reflected under this category on our balance sheet are held for use in the operations of tripos 
due to the fast paced development of new technologies in computer hardware and laboratory equipment  we closely monitor the original life expectancies of new purchases and set our depreciation or amortization rates accordingly to best match the economic useful life of the asset 
assets or equipment that are no longer of use to the organization are written down to their realizable value and then disposed 
derivatives 
tripos at times utilizes interest rate swap agreements to create a fixed interest rate for portions of our long term floating rate debt 
additionally  we may enter foreign currency exchange instruments to protect our operating margins when performing on contracts denominated in currencies other than those in use by our selling office 
our internal policies do not allow for speculative trading in derivatives 
use of derivatives is only allowed for hedging or rate protection purposes 
derivative contracts are only allowed with high quality credit worthy financial institutions to further minimize counter party risk 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income taxes 
tripos computes income taxes using the liability method 
the primary difference between financial statement income and taxable income results from the use of different methods of computing depreciation  capitalized development costs  and other timing differences 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of research and development credits  which are subject to interpretation of us federal tax regulations  and the change in valuation allowance related to net operating loss carryforwards  which is determined by the performance of our foreign operations 
cautionary statements additional important factors to be considered our future results could differ materially from those discussed in this annual report 
factors that could contribute to such differences  include  but are not limited to  the following we cannot be certain that our sales strategy will be effective in achieving additional sales of our products 
our strategy of providing direct integration of sophisticated information technology with the experimental sciences in the form of chemical laboratories to produce faster  more cost effective new product discovery has not yet garnered widespread commercial acceptance 
this integrated approach requires our sales force to broaden its existing knowledge base in selling discovery software to include selling software consulting services and discovery research services 
we cannot be certain that our sales force will be able to efficiently widen its knowledge base and then apply that information to make additional sales 
there can be no assurance that the market will accept our integrated approach or that competitors will not offer other approaches that gain greater technological acceptance 
we face uncertainty in raising additional capital that may be necessary to fund our operations 
we may seek to raise additional capital through additional public or private debt or equity financings  collaborative arrangements  borrowings or other available sources 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available on terms that are favorable to the company and its stockholders  if at all 
if additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or securities convertible into equity  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we cannot obtain additional financing when needed  we could be forced to curtail some of our current activities or delay implementation of other initiatives 
our current and potential customers consist primarily of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  which face risks that could affect our ability to sell our products 
we have benefited to date from the increasing trend among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource chemical research and development projects 
however  a reversal or slowing of this trend or a general economic downturn in these industries  such as experienced in  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
thus  our ability to generate revenue is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause reductions and delays in research and development expenditures within our industry 
these risks and uncertainties are not within our control 
in addition  consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries will reduce the number of our potential customers  and may adversely affect our future revenues 
if one of the parties to a conso lidation uses the products or services of one of our competitors  we may lose existing customers as a result of such consolidation 
we face intense competition 
we compete with the research departments of pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  combinatorial chemistry companies  contract research companies and research and academic institutions in size  relative expertise and sophistication  speed and costs of identifying and optimizing potential lead compounds and developing and optimizing chemical processes 
these competitors may have greater financial and other resources and more experience than we have in certain research and development methods 
in addition  internal departments of corporations may be resistant to outsourcing software  because it could reduce those departments budgets 
moreover  our competitors may  in the future  offer broader product lines or technologies or products that are more commercially attractive than our current or future products or that may render our technologies or products obsolete 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we may incur significant costs in protecting our intellectual property rights or responding to claims of infringement from others 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and enforce patents  protect trade secrets and copyrights  enforce restrictive licenses granted to third parties  obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties when necessary or developed in collaboration with us  and conduct our business without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we currently rely upon a combination of trademark  patent  copyright and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure agreements and other contracts to protect our proprietary rights 
nevertheless  our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate and we may be unable to prevent others from offering products and services substantially similar to ours 
we also need to secure and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property outside of the united states  beca use our sales are global 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and many companies engaging in international business have encountered considerable difficulties in safeguarding their proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions 
moreover  third parties may claim that our current or future products or services infringe upon their intellectual property 
litigation over these issues could be a significant distraction and we may incur significant costs  including several damages 
in the event that it is determined that one of our products infringe upon another s proprietary rights  we may be required to obtain a license in order to continue selling our products 
that license may not be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
our quarterly operating results could vary significantly 
we have historically experienced stronger financial performance in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year followed by a comparative decline in the first and second quarters 
quarterly operating results may continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including lengthy sales cycles  market acceptance of new products and upgrades  timing of new product introductions  changes in pricing policies  changes in general economic and competitive conditions  seasonal slowdowns  and the timing and integration of acquisitions 
we also expect to continue to experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results due to general and industry specific economic conditions that may affect the research and development expenditures of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are no t a good indication of our future performance 
our business is dependent upon the extent to which pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies collaborate with drug discovery companies for one or more aspects of their drug discovery process 
our commercial success depends on our ability to enter into joint venture or other collaborative arrangements with third parties 
to date  we have entered into numerous such arrangements with large pharmaceutical companies and emerging biotechnology companies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish these collaborations  that any such collaborations will be on favorable terms  or that current or future collaborations will ultimately be successful 
our ability to convince pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to use our drug discovery capabilities  rather than develop them internally  will depend on many factors  including our ability to provide scientists and technologies that are of the highest caliber  develop drug discovery technologies that will result in the identification of higher quality drug candidates  achieve expected results within our customers timeframes  meeting quality and cost guidelines  and design  create and manufacture sufficient quantities of our chemical compounds for our customers 
even if we are able to address these factors  these customers may nevertheless determine to perform these activities internally or with other companies that provide services similar to ours 
we are dependent on dr 
john mcalister  among others  and the loss of their services could affect our ability to be successful 
our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key senior management personnel  in particular  our president and chief executive officer  dr 
john p 
mcalister  as well as key technical personnel within the software  consulting and chemistry operations 
we believe that dr 
mcalister s reputation and prominence in the field provide us with a competitive advantage 
none of our key personnel is bound by an employment agreement or covered by an insurance policy where tripos is the beneficiary 
the loss of one or more key members could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we may not be able to recruit and retain the experienced scientists we need to compete in our industry 
we compete with the research departments of pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  combinatorial chemistry companies  contract research companies and academic institutions for new scientific personnel 
we compete with consulting companies for experienced computer programmers to carry out our software consulting services 
we cannot be assured that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel should the worldwide demand for these skilled individuals increase 
we believe that there is a shortage of  and significant competition for  scientists with the skills and experience in the sciences necessary to perform the services we offer 
in addition  our inability to hire additional qualified personnel may require an increase in the workload for both existing and new personnel 
we may not be successful in attracting new scientists or sal es personnel or in retaining or motivating our existing personnel 
pharmaceutical and health care reform could reduce the amounts that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have available to retain our services 
we expect that a substantial portion of revenues in the foreseeable future will be derived from services provided to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
if legislative proposals or reforms are adopted that have a material adverse effect on the businesses  financial condition  and results of operations of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actual or prospective customers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely effected as well 
for example  future legislation could limit the prices pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can charge for the drugs they market 
this would have the effect of reducing the resources that these companies can devote to the research and development of new drugs  which would in turn reduce the amount of services that we perfor m and our resulting revenues 
item a 
market risk s our exposure to market risks is limited to foreign exchange variances and fluctuations in interest rates 
to date  neither foreign exchange nor interest rate exposure has resulted in a material impact 
our foreign exchange risk is presently limited to currencies that historically have exhibited only minor fluctuations 
assets outside the united states are primarily located in england 
our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are not hedged 
the net assets in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the year end exchange rates were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the potential reduction in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
any loss in fair value of permanently invested funds would be reflected in other comprehensive income and would not impact our net income 
our foreign currency transaction gains and losses for and were immaterial 
our interest rate risk is attributable to borrowings under the line of credit and mortgage loan 
we have fixed a portion of our floating rate interest risk on the mortgage loan through the purchase of swap instruments 
unrealized loss on our interest rate swap at december  was not significant 
we will continue to monitor our exposure to floating interest rate risk on line of credit borrowings and endeavor to mitigate this risk through the use of appropriate hedging instruments
