overview roxio is a leading provider of digital media software and services for the consumer market 
we have pioneered the development of consumer software products which allow our customers to create  manage and move their rich digital media 
our strategy is to expand our offerings for both products and services to allow for even easier management of and access to rich digital entertainment and personal media  including music  photos and video 
we provide software that enables individuals to record digital content onto cds and dvds as well as photo and video editing products 
taken together  these products enable us to deliver a comprehensive digital media solution to our customers 
through our pressplay service  users can stream  download and burn a wide variety of digital music 
our products and services allow customers to access  archive  create  customize and share digital materials in formats compatible with the growing number of digital entertainment devices such as personal computers pcs  cd and dvd players  compressed audio players and personal digital assistants 
effective with our acquisition of pressplay on may   we operate our business in two divisions  the consumer software products division and the online music distribution division 
to date  we have derived 
table of contents substantially all of our revenue from sales of consumer software products 
for a description of developments related to the online music distribution business  see part i  item  recent developments 
our business we derive revenues by sales of our products primarily through distributors and to end users through our web site and toll free number 
we also sell to original equipment manufacturers oems 
distributors resell standard and deluxe versions of our products to retailers of computer software products 
the deluxe versions of our products include more features than the standard versions 
sales to distributors and direct sales to end users through our web site and toll free number collectively represented of our net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal however  the number of units sold to our distributors and end users represented less than of the total number of units sold in fiscal  less than in fiscal and approximately in fiscal we expect that sales to distributors and direct sales to end users will continue to increase as a percentage of our total sales 
we also sell our software products to oems such as pc manufacturers and cd and dvd recordable drive manufacturers and integrators 
generally  oems bundle a standard version of our software together with their products pursuant to licensing agreements with us 
sales to oems represented of our net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in the future  we anticipate that cd recording technology revenues from our standard products to oems will continue to decline in total and as a percentage of total net revenues as a result of increased cost pressure with our customers and competition in the maturing cd recording technology 
we believe that these declines may be partially offset by increases from our new dvd technologies or from imaging and digital video editing technologies licensed to oems 
international sales  defined as sales from our international subsidiaries  accounted for approximately of our net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal one of our distributors  ingram micro  accounted for of net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal a second distributor  navarre corporation  accounted for less than of net revenues in each of fiscal and and in fiscal one oem customer  dell computer corporation  accounted for of net revenues in fiscal  less than in fiscal and in fiscal mergers  acquisitions and divestitures in january  we acquired mgi software corp 
mgi software  a canadian company that develops and markets imaging and digital video editing products 
this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and mgi software s results of operations are included in our financial statements from its date of acquisition 
amounts related to identifiable intangible assets resulting from the acquisition are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of three years 
goodwill is not amortized but will be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
in addition  we periodically review the unamortized balance of other intangible assets to determine if the amounts are realizable and may in the future make adjustments to the carrying balance or amortization period based upon these reviews 
in november  we acquired certain assets of napster  inc  napster music company  inc  and napster mobile company  inc 
in exchange for million in total consideration which consisted of million in cash and warrants to purchase up to  shares of roxio s common stock 
subsequent to our fiscal year end  in april  we sold assets related to our goback system recovery product to symantec for approximately million in cash 
of the total purchase price  million will be held in escrow for a period of one year 
the transaction is taxable 

table of contents also subsequent to our fiscal year end  in may  we acquired pressplay  a premier online music service 
pressplay will serve as the foundation for the launch of our new legal on line music service under the napster brand 
under the terms of the agreement  we acquired substantially all of the ownership of pressplay 
we purchased its ownership for million in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock 
this acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase 
as a result  the total purchase price will be allocated to tangible and intangible assets 
acquired intangible assets will be then amortized over their economic life  whereas the residual of the purchase price will be classified as goodwill and evaluated for impairment at least on an annual basis 
we anticipate that the issuance of the million shares of common stock in association with the acquisition will have a potentially dilutive effect on earnings per share in future periods 
if these shares had been outstanding for all of their effect on earnings per share would have been anti dilutive 
basis of presentation our fiscal year ends on march unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 
we were incorporated in august as a wholly owned subsidiary of adaptec  inc adaptec to conduct substantially all of the business of its software products group 
upon legal separation from adaptec in may  adaptec transferred to roxio substantially all of the assets and liabilities that appeared on roxio s consolidated balance sheet 
prior to legal separation on may   we conducted our business as an operating segment of adaptec 
our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to legal separation have been carved out of the consolidated financial statements of adaptec using the historical results of operations of the adaptec software operating segment and historical bases of the assets and liabilities of adaptec that our company comprises 
certain software products directly related to adaptec s hardware products  which were historically reflected in our results of operations in adaptec s segment reporting  were retained by adaptec after legal separation 
as such  the revenues and associated costs of sales and operating expenses related to these products have not been included in our financial statements 
accordingly  the results reported herein do not reflect the software operating segment disclosures previously reported under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  within the adaptec annual reports 
prior to legal separation  the consolidated financial statements also included allocations to us of certain shared expenses  including centralized legal  accounting  finance  manufacturing  real estate  information technology  distribution  customer services  sales  marketing  engineering and other adaptec corporate services and infrastructure costs 
the expense allocations have been determined on a basis that adaptec and we considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of the services provided to us or the benefit received by us 
the allocations and charges are based on a percentage of total corporate costs for the services provided  based on factors such as headcount  revenue  gross asset value or the specific level of activity directly related to such costs 
for approximately months following the separation date  adaptec provided transitional services and support in the areas of information technology systems  supply chain  buildings and facilities  marketing and communications  finance and accounting 
specified charges for transition services were generally cost plus and  for products purchased from adaptec  cost plus 
although the fees provided for in the agreements were intended to represent the fair market value of these services  we cannot assure you that these fees necessarily reflected the costs of obtaining the services from unrelated third parties or of our providing these services internally 
however  we believe that purchasing these services from adaptec provided an efficient means of obtaining these services during the transition period 
we do not believe that these arrangements with adaptec materially altered our financial position or results of operations during the transition period 
substantially all of the agreements for transitional services have now been terminated 
during fiscal and  we negotiated new or revised agreements with various third parties as a separate  stand alone entity 
as part of adaptec  we benefited from various economies of scale including shared global administrative functions  
table of contents facilities and product distribution 
our costs have increased as a result of our becoming a separate  stand alone entity 
the financial information presented in this annual report is not necessarily indicative of our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the future nor is certain of the financial information presented in this annual report for periods prior to legal separation necessarily indicative of what our financial position  results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been a separate  stand alone entity for the periods presented 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our significant accounting policies 
certain of these policies require substantial judgment on the part of management 
these critical accounting policies and the effect that changes in management s estimates could have on our consolidated financial statements are further described below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulleting sab  revenue recognition in financial statements and american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition 
we primarily sell our software products through two channels oems and distributors 
for software product sales to oems  revenues are generally recognized based on reported product shipments from oems to their customers provided that all fees are fixed or determinable  evidence of an arrangement exists and collectibility is probable 
for arrangements in which all elements are not delivered at the point of reported product shipment  revenues are deferred and amortized over the fulfillment period 
for software product sales to distributors  revenues are recognized upon product shipment to the distributors or receipt of the products by the distributor  depending on the shipping terms  provided that all fees are fixed or determinable  evidence of an arrangement exists and collectibility is probable 
our distributor arrangements provide distributors with certain product rotation rights 
additionally  we permit our distributors to return products in certain circumstances  generally during periods of product transition 
end users additionally have the right to return their product within days of the purchase 
we establish allowances for expected product returns in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  and sab these allowances are recorded as a direct reduction of revenues and accounts receivable 
management applies significant judgment and relies on historical experience in establishing these allowances 
if future return patterns differ from past return patterns  due to reduced demand for our product or other factors beyond our control  we may be required to increase these allowances in the future and may be required to reduce future revenues 
if at any point in the future we become unable to estimate returns reliably  we could be required to defer recognizing revenues until the distributor notifies us that the product has been sold to an end user 
we utilize mail in rebates mirs as a marketing tool to promote our products and acquire new customers 
estimated redemption of mirs is recorded as a direct reduction to revenues and is accrued at the date the related revenues are recognized 
estimates are based upon historical redemption rates and current market factors 

table of contents for direct software product sales to end users  revenues are recognized upon shipment by us to the end users provided all appropriate revenue recognition criteria have been met 
costs related to post contract customer support pcs are accrued at the date the related revenues are recognized 
pcs obligations relate to telephone support  and minor bug fixes and updates are downloadable from our web site 
as no separate charge is made for the pcs and the pcs is available for a period of less than one year  we do not ascribe any value to the pcs or defer any portion of revenues for it 
if pcs services become a more significant portion of our costs  we may be required to assign a portion of our revenues to pcs and recognize those revenues over the period of the pcs services 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above 
generally  our customer payment terms do not exceed days 
in addition  we maintain a separate reserve for all invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category and an analysis of our historical experience of bad debts 
we also monitor our accounts receivable for any build up to any one customer  industry or geographic region 
one customer  a large distributor  accounted for approximately of our accounts receivable at march  and at march  a second customer accounted for less than of accounts receivable at march  and at march  a third customer accounted for less than of accounts receivable at march  and at march  a fourth customer accounted for less than of accounts receivable at march  and at march  the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable  including changes in general economic conditions  may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist primarily of goodwill and other intangible assets and property and equipment 
we review long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  significant changes in general economic conditions  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business  difficulty or delays in integrating an acquired business or a significant change in the operations of our business 
recoverability of long lived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
estimating these cash flows requires management to make judgments about growth in demand for our products  sustainability of gross margins  and our ability to integrate acquired companies and achieve economies of scale 
changes in these estimates could require us to write down the carrying value of our long lived assets 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
we assess impairment of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that a two step test be performed 
because roxio constituted one reporting unit as of march   as defined by sfas no 
 this test has been performed on a total company basis 
first  the fair value of roxio is compared to its net book value 
if the fair value exceeds the net book value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the net book value exceeds the fair value  then the implied fair value of our goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
because our fair market value from the date of legal separation through march  exceeded our net book value  we have determined that goodwill is not impaired 

table of contents investments in non consolidated company 
we have made an investment in an early stage private company  yesvideo 
this investment is accounted for under the cost method  as we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over this company s operations 
we periodically monitor this investment for impairment and will record a reduction in carrying values if and when necessary 
the evaluation process is based upon information that we request from this privately held company 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies  and as such  the basis for this evaluation is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from this company 
as part of the evaluation process  the review includes  but is not limited to  a review of the company s cash position  recent financing activities  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes  and competition 
if we determine that the carrying value of the company is at an amount below fair value  or if the company completes a financing based upon a valuation significantly lower than our initial investment  it is our policy to record a reserve and the related write down would be recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations 
at march   we had million invested in yesvideo 
if the company does not complete an initial public offering or is not acquired by a publicly traded company for cash  we may not be able to sell this investment 
in addition  even if we are able to sell this investment  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell it at a gain or even recover our investment 
the prolonged general decline in the nasd national market and the market prices of publicly traded technology companies  as well as any additional declines in the future  will adversely affect our ability to realize gains or a return of our capital on this investment 
as of march   we had recorded no loss on this investment in yesvideo 
product development costs 
costs for the development of new software are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional development costs are capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
for all software development projects to date  management has determined that under our current software development process  the product is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  accordingly  no costs have been capitalized to date 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of march   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses and accrued liabilities and other provisions  not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations

we recognize licensing revenues from oems based on reported product shipments by oems  provided all fees are fixed or determinable  evidence of an arrangement exists and collection is probable 
we recognize revenues from sales to distributors upon shipment by us or receipt of the products by the distributor  depending on the shipping terms  provided all fees are fixed or determinable  evidence of an arrangement exists and collection is probable 
we provide for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments in the period in which the revenues are recognized 
our distributor agreements generally provide distributors with stock rotation and price protection rights as well as the right to return discontinued products 
we recognize revenues from direct product sales to end users upon shipment by us 
net revenues were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in deluxe product revenues of million  largely driven by higher distributor sales of our easy cd creator which was released in the fourth quarter of fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in oem revenues of million 
net revenues decreased during fiscal as compared to an increase of during fiscal the decrease in fiscal resulted from a decrease in oem revenues of million  reflecting lower per unit 
table of contents royalty rates  partially offset by an increase in deluxe product revenues of million  driven by higher distributor sales of our easy cd dvd creator which was released in the fourth quarter of fiscal products acquired through the acquisition of mgi software contributed additional net revenues of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal in both fiscal years  worldwide growth in shipments to oems continued 
however  average per unit license fee reductions completely offset higher unit volume shipments in fiscal and we are continuing to experience downward pricing pressure on the per unit royalty rates we receive from our oems due to continued pressure on the oem s margins as well as increased competition 
oem revenues accounted for million or of net revenues in fiscal  million or in fiscal and million or in fiscal revenues of deluxe products through the combination of distributors and direct sales accounted for a larger portion of our total revenues than in prior periods 
these sales accounted for million or of net revenues in fiscal  million or in fiscal and million or in fiscal gross margin gross margin is the percentage of profit from net revenues after deducting cost of revenues  which includes costs related to the physical goods shipped  third party licensed intellectual property  freight  warranty  end user technical support and scrap 
our gross margin from oem revenues is generally significantly higher than our gross margin from distributor revenues primarily due to lower product costs and to a lesser extent due to a different level of product support effort associated with oem sales compared to distributor sales 
for sales of our products through oems  the oems are responsible for the first level of product support and we only provide a second level of support to the oem 
we expect gross margin to fluctuate on a quarterly basis based on the relative mix of oem and distributor revenues 
additionally  over time  our overall gross margin may decline somewhat as the relative percentage of net revenues derived from distributor sales increases and if we are unable to offset margin reductions through less expensive distribution  packaging and support costs 
gross margin was of net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  the change in our revenue mix toward a higher percentage of distributor revenues resulted in increased production costs and accounted for a decrease of approximately two percentage points in gross margin 
this was offset by a reduction in technical support costs  primarily in the first half of fiscal in fiscal  the decrease in the margin was primarily a result of the change in sales mix to a higher percentage of distributor sales of our deluxe products  which carry a lower margin  and a lower percentage of product licensing to oems  which carry a higher margin 
the decrease was also due to increases in the cost of technical support services and royalty expenses 
we believe that gross margins may decrease further in the future as the mix continues to shift towards distributor sales and as we increase the revenues from our online music distribution division which will have lower gross margins than our historical levels of gross margins 
operating expenses we classify operating expenses as research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative 
each category includes related expenses for salaries  employee benefits  incentive compensation  travel  telephone  communications  rent and allocated facilities and professional fees 
our sales and marketing expenses include additional expenditures specific to the marketing group  such as public relations and advertising  trade shows  and marketing collateral materials and expenditures specific to the sales group  such as commissions 
to date  all software product development costs have been expensed as incurred 
our operating expenses have increased following our separation from adaptec as we developed an infrastructure to support 
table of contents our level of business activity  built a corporate brand identity separate from adaptec and promoted our products  added personnel and created incentive programs with our distribution partners 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal research and development expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal this increase was primarily due to additional personnel and consultants to support increased development efforts for both cd and dvd recordable software products 
research and development expenses remained unchanged during fiscal from fiscal in fiscal  there was an increase in payroll and related costs of million and an increase in rental expense of million  primarily attributable to the acquisition of mgi 
however  this increase was substantially offset by a reduction in bonus expense of million  a reduction in outside services expense of  and a reduction in various other expenses of million 
research and development headcount was at march   at march  and at march  we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we intend to continue to invest in product development 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal approximately two thirds of the increase in absolute dollars resulted from higher advertising and promotion expenses related to building our product brands 
the remainder of the increase related to higher staffing levels as we expanded our sales and marketing team to pursue revenue generating opportunities 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a reduction in advertising expense of million  a reduction in bonus expense of million and a reduction in various other expenses of million 
this was partially offset by an increase in payroll and related costs of million and an increase in rental expense of million primarily attributable to the acquisition of mgi software 
sales and marketing headcount was at march   at march  and at march  we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we intend to invest in marketing and advertising focused on building our corporate identity and to continue our current efforts to build our product and service brands 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal this increase resulted primarily from payroll and other related costs associated with establishing a senior management team and dedicated human resources  information technology and finance support for us to operate as a stand alone entity 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal the increase resulted primarily from a million settlement of a lawsuit by certain former shareholders of incat systems and 
table of contents million of related legal expense 
also contributing to this increase was the integration of mgi software 
the integration of mgi software contributed to an increase in payroll and related costs of million  an increase in rent expense of million and an increase in outside services of million 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was partially offset by a reduction in bonus expense of million and a reduction in various other expenses of million 
general and administrative headcount increased from at march  to at march  and at march  we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we accommodate our growth  add related infrastructure and incur expenses related to being a public company 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal this expense represented of net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets decreased in fiscal from fiscal in fiscal  this expense consisted of the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquisition of cequadrat and wild file 
we elected to early adopt sfas no 
effective april   and accordingly  we ceased to amortize goodwill on that date 
the reduction in amortization expense in fiscal is due to the adoption of sfas no 
partially offset by  of amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of mgi software in january see note goodwill and other intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets increased in fiscal from fiscal this increase was due to additional expense of million related to the intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of mgi software in january and napster in november  offset by the cessation of amortization expenses related to cequadrat s intangible assets in the second quarter of fiscal as these intangible assets were now fully amortized 
although we have not completed the accounting for the pressplay transaction  we expect that there will be some charges relating to the amortization of identifiable intangible assets in the quarter ending june  and that this amortization will likely continue in future quarters 
stock based compensation charges 
stock based compensation charges relate to the amortization of costs associated with stock and warrants issued to virgin holding inc virgin  stock options issued to employees  and the commitment of roxio stock options to adaptec employees who became roxio employees 
stock based compensation charges were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal this expense represented of net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal stock based compensation charges increased in fiscal from fiscal in fiscal  we recorded million in non cash charges associated with stock option commitments made in the third quarter of fiscal to adaptec employees who were projected to become roxio employees upon legal separation 
also  in fiscal  we recorded stock based compensation charges of million related to the assumption of restricted stock as part of the wild file acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal stock based compensation charges increased substantially in fiscal due to additional stock based compensation charges related to the issuance of stock option grants to roxio employees and the issuance of common stock and warrants to virgin 
stock based compensation charges decreased in fiscal from fiscal this decrease was due to lower amortization expenses recorded in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million related to the issuance of stock option grants to roxio employees at exercise prices below fair market value at the date of grant and the re measurement of stock options granted to 
table of contents adaptec employees who became roxio employees upon legal separation 
amortization related to these stock options totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal also  in fiscal  we recorded an additional  of non cash charges associated with stock option commitments made in the third quarter of fiscal to adaptec employees who were projected to become roxio employees upon legal separation 
in addition  in fiscal  we issued common stock and a warrant to virgin and recorded stock based compensation of million in connection with this transaction 
in fiscal  we recorded the remaining amortization expense of  related to the issuance of common stock to virgin and an expense reduction of  related to the re measurement of the warrant

other income  net prior to fiscal  we did not have cash equivalents and short term investments as adaptec managed cash on a centralized basis 
accordingly  we did not record any interest income prior to fiscal in fiscal  other income  net  consisted primarily of interest income on our cash equivalents and short term investments

provision for income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
see note income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our effective income tax rates were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of in fiscal primarily due to non deductible acquisition charges and stock based compensation 
in fiscal  our operating results were included in adaptec s consolidated united states federal and state income tax returns 
the provision for income taxes in our financial statements for those years has been determined on a separate return basis 
prior to our separation from adaptec  roxio benefited from an advantageous tax rate system in singapore  which resulted in a lower effective tax rate for fiscal our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of in fiscal years and primarily due to stock based compensation that is not deductible for tax purposes and taxes in foreign jurisdictions 
we are subject to tax in jurisdictions in which we operate around the world 
our future effective tax rate will be impacted by our organizational structure and the geographic distribution of our worldwide revenue and profitability 
as a result of these factors  our effective tax rate may vary in the future

we also used million in our acquisition of mgi software  net of cash acquired of  in fiscal  million was used to purchase capital equipment  million was used to purchase napster s assets  million was used to purchase short term investments and million was used to invest in yesvideo 
the outflows of cash were offset partially by proceeds of million received from the sales and maturities of our marketable securities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal resulting from cash transfers to adaptec 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million  primarily from the transfer of million in net cash from adaptec to fund our operations as a stand alone entity 
this amount consisted of million transferred to us on the date of legal separation net of million transferred by us to adaptec prior to legal separation 
in addition  we received proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan totaling million and proceeds from the sale of our common stock to a strategic partner of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal included proceeds of million of cash borrowed through our line of credit and million from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
the inflows cash were partially offset by million of cash disbursed for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock under our authorized buy back program and  of principal cash payments made on our capital lease obligations 
our major commitments relate to payments for operating leases related to our facilities and capital leases related to equipment 
at march   future commitments under operating leases totaled million  payable through  and future commitments under capital leases totaled million  payable through 
table of contents the future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases and the present value of future minimum capital lease payments as of march  are as follows in thousands capital leases operating leases total minimum lease payments less amount representing interest at to obligations under capital leases less current portion long term capital lease obligation we also sublease one of our facilities to an unrelated third party 
the sublease expires in october expected future minimum sublease income is  in fiscal and  in fiscal in january  we entered into an agreement with a bank to provide a million revolving line of credit  collateralized by substantially all of its assets 
the line of credit bears interest either at a fixed rate of libor plus per annum or at a variable rate of prime plus per annum and expires in january the line of credit contains certain covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios 
the covenants require i quick ratio of cash and accounts receivable to current liabilities of at least to at the end of each fiscal quarter throughout the term of the agreement  ii ratio of total liabilities to effective tangible net worth of not greater than to at the end of each fiscal quarter throughout the term of the agreement 
as of march   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
there was million outstanding under the line of credit at march  in april  the quick ratio covenant was replaced with a new covenant whereby we must maintain a minimum balance of million in the sum of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our long term debt consisted of the following at march  and march march  in thousands revolving credit agreement obligations under capital leases with interest rates ranging from to long term debt on may   the date of legal separation  adaptec contributed million in cash to us  including million in cash held by our overseas subsidiaries 
the contribution was non reciprocal and we will not repay any of this amount 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  including the cash received from this contribution upon legal separation  together with cash flows from future operating results and access to funds under our revolving line of credit will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  any material acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies or material joint venture could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
we cannot assure you that such additional financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if sufficient funds are not available  we may not be able to introduce new products or compete effectively 
table of contents in any of our markets  either of which could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations  we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future 
if we are unable to generate positive cash flow from operations  we may be required to obtain additional financing from other sources 
generally  payment terms from our customers do not exceed days  while our liabilities with vendors are due from zero to days following the invoice date 
generally  payments of receivables by our customers to us are not contingent upon resale and we have not experienced payment delays due to product disputes 
we have never held derivative financial instruments and do not engage in hedging activities 
as a result of having a revolving line of credit  we may be exposed to near term adverse changes in interest rates or other market prices 
subsequent to our fiscal year end  in april  we sold assets related to our goback system recovery product to symantec for approximately million in cash and acquired substantially all of the interests of pressplay for million in cash and million shares of roxio common stock 
also subsequent to our fiscal year end  on june   we issued  shares of our common stock in a private placement to certain accredited investors 
the shares were sold at a price of per share with gross proceeds of  we are obligated under the purchase agreements to file a registration statement on form s for the resale of the shares within business days of the close of the financing 
the gross proceeds will be reduced by placement fees and legal and accounting fees totaling approximately to million 
as of the end of may and including the net value of the million from the financing completed on june   roxio had in total approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we anticipate that this balance will decline in the near term based on the use of cash to relaunch napster and will likely continue to decline until the online music distribution reaches wide adoption  if ever  or the software business is able to generate offsetting positive cash flows  which cannot be assured

roxio adopted sfas no 
during the fourth fiscal quarter ended march  the provisions of eitf no 
continues to apply for an exit activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of eitf no 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
the effect upon adoption of sfas no 
is to change on a prospective basis the timing of when restructuring charges are recorded  from a commitment date approach to the date when the liability is incurred 
the adoption of sfas has not had a material effect on roxio s financial statements

the following is a summary of the agreements that we have determined are within the scope of fin as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby our officers and directors are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the term of the indemnification period is for the officer s or director s term in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of our insurance policy coverage  we 
table of contents believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal

the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
we have not incurred significant costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is insignificant 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of march  when  as part of an acquisition  we acquire all of the stock or all of the assets and liabilities of a company  we assume the liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make for such obligations is undeterminable at this time

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
we maintain our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions and  as part of our cash management process  we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions 
amounts deposited with these institutions may exceed federal depository insurance limits 
in addition  the portfolio of investments conforms to our policy regarding concentration of investments  maximum maturity and quality of investment 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  corporate bonds  us agencies securities  asset backed securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on these funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
all of our short term investments mature in less than two years 
the following table presents the amounts of our short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of march  our cash equivalents are invested in money market funds  commercial paper and municipal securities  which are not included in the table because those funds are not subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities 
maturing in less than one year more than one year total estimated fair value dollars in thousands short term investments weighted average interest rate we do not currently hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in hedging activities 
we have available to us a million revolving line of credit 
currently  there is million outstanding under the line of credit that bears interest at either a fixed rate of libor plus per annum or at a variable rate of prime rate plus per annum and expires in january we do not hold any other variable interest rate debt 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable and accounts payable 
exchange rate risk we develop our software in the united states  canada and europe and sell it in north america  europe  the pacific rim and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
for our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency  we translate assets and liabilities to us dollars using period end exchange rates and translate revenues and expenses using average exchange rates during the period 
exchange gains and losses arising from translation of foreign entity financial statements are included as a component of other comprehensive income 
for foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the us dollar  certain assets and liabilities are re measured at the period end or historical rates as appropriate 
revenues and expenses are re measured at the average rate during the period 
currency translation gains and losses are recognized in current operations 

table of contents we sell our products primarily to original equipment manufacturers and distributors throughout the world 
prior to legal separation from adaptec  sales to customers and cash and cash equivalents were primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  since legal separation  we have been transitioning the sales of our international subsidiaries to euro and japanese yen 
cash and cash equivalents are predominantly denominated in us dollars
