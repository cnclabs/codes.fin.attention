we operate stores primarily situated in central locations in high traffic  upscale malls 
the first cache store was opened in in florida as a couture boutique 
from until  cache grew under the ownership of the saul family  expanding from stores to stores at the end of in addition  in we acquired the store lillie rubin chain and grew it to stores by the end of in october  we hired brian woolf as our chief executive officer 
mr 
woolf embarked on a series of strategic initiatives to accelerate growth and enhance profitability 
these initiatives included hiring three new members of management  all of whom have extensive retail experience  re launching the cache brand through a national advertising campaign  transitioning the merchandise mix to an exclusively cache and lillie rubin branded line of apparel  introducing our day into evening sportswear line in lillie rubin  developing a more modern and efficient store format and significantly reducing the number of stock keeping units and vendors as a result of these initiatives  comparable stores sales have increased from in fiscal to in fiscal and gross margins have increased from to during that same time period 
improvements to our gross margins were primarily the result of our significant reduction in the number of stock keeping units we carry and vendors from which we purchase 
general net sales 
net sales consist of sales from comparable stores and non comparable stores 
a store is not included in comparable store sales until the first day of the fiscal month following the twelfth full month of sales 
non comparable store sales include sales generated at new stores prior to the period when they are considered comparable stores and sales generated from stores that we have since closed 
cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  cost of freight from vendors  payroll for our design  buying and merchandising personnel and store occupancy costs 
store occupancy costs include rent  contingent rents  common area maintenance and real estate taxes 
store operating expenses 
store operating expenses include payroll  payroll taxes  health benefits  insurance  credit card processing fees  depreciation  licenses and taxes as well as marketing and advertising expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include district and regional manager payroll  other corporate personnel payroll and employee benefits  employment taxes  insurance  legal and other professional fees and other corporate level expenses 
corporate level expenses are primarily attributable to our corporate headquarters in new york 
accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements  located elsewhere in this document 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
inventories 
merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market using the retail method of accounting 
we make assumptions to adjust the value of inventory based on historical experience and current information 
this procedure inherently reduces the carrying value of inventories as markdowns are initiated 
these assumptions can have a significant impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
self insurance 
we are self insured for losses and liabilities related primarily to employee health and welfare claims 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on company experience 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized at the point of sale  which occurs when merchandise is sold in an over the counter transaction or upon receipt by a customer 
our customers have the right to return merchandise 
sales are reported net of actual and estimated returns 
we maintain a reserve for potential product returns and record  as a reduction to sales  a provision for estimated product returns  which is determined based on historical experience 
results of operations the following table sets forth our operating results  expressed as a percentage of net sales

operating income other income net income before income taxes income taxes net income weeks ended december  fiscal compared to weeks ended december  fiscal net sales 
our net sales increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase reflects million of additional net sales as a result of a increase in our comparable store sales 
the remainder of this increase was the result of additional net sales from non comparable stores 
gross profit 
our gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was the combined result of higher net sales and increased gross profit margins 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to from 
this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher initial margins resulting from a reduction in the number of our vendors and the number of stock keeping units 
these reductions enabled us to commit to bulk fabric purchases and increased our ability to receive favorable pricing from vendors 
we expect the improvement created by higher initial mark ups to continue to benefit results in fiscal store operating expenses 
our store operating expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  store operating expenses increased to from  primarily due to an increase in marketing and advertising expenses of million which were partially offset by a reduction in store operating expenses as a percentage of sales  due to the fixed nature of most store operating expenses

income taxes 
our taxes increased to million from million  an increase of million over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was attributable to higher taxable income  as well as an increase in our effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in our overall effective income tax rate is attributable to increased levels of federal taxable income subject to tax in a higher tax bracket  as well as a change in the mix of income subject to tax in the various states in which we conduct business

gross profit 
our gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to from 
this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of the change in our merchandising strategy 
we reduced the number of vendors from which we purchased during fiscal by from fiscal and reduced the number of stock keeping units we carried by 
the effects of these changes on our financial performance were realized in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the increase in our gross margin was offset in part by an increase in occupancy expenses for new stores and merchandise markdowns due to the difficult retail environment in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal store operating expenses 
our store operating expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year

quarterly results and seasonality we experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  fashion trends and shifts in timing of certain holidays 
our business is subject to seasonal influences  characterized by highest sales during our fourth fiscal quarter october  november and december and lowest sales during our third fiscal quarter july  august and september 
the following table includes our unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the eight quarters during the two year period ended december  we derived this data from our unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements 
we believe that we have prepared this information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and that we have included all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  to present fairly the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with our audited annual consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document 
the operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period

we have historically satisfied our cash requirements principally through cash flow from operations 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million  which included cash and marketable securities of million 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  a decrease in receivables of million  an increase in accounts payable of  and an increase in accrued liabilities and compensation of million 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  a decrease in inventory of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million  offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable of million 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million and an increase in accrued liabilities and compensation of million  offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable of million 
cash used in investing activities was approximately million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal these amounts were used for the purchase of marketable securities as well as the payment for equipment and leasehold improvements in new and remodeled stores 
our capital requirements depend primarily on the number of new stores we open  the number of existing stores we remodel and the timing of these expenditures 
projected capital expenditures for fiscal to fund new store openings and remodelings are approximately million 
based on our experience with new store openings  we estimate that the average net investment to open new stores is approximately  to  which includes new store opening expenses and initial inventory  net of landlord contributions 
we estimate that the average net investment to remodel an existing store is approximately  to  net of landlord contributions 
cash provided by used in used in financing activities was negligible in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal we have a line of credit with fleet bank  na  permitting us to borrow up to million on a revolving basis 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a maximum annual rate equal to the bank s prime rate  currently 
the agreement relating to this facility contains selected financial and other covenants 
in addition  the credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness or create or incur liens on our assets 
while this facility is unsecured  if a default occurs under the facility  we are required to grant the lender a security interest in our inventory and accounts receivable 
we are in compliance with all loan covenants 
this facility currently expires in november we believe that cash flows from operations  our current available cash and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and contemplated new store opening expenses for at least the next months 
if our cash flow from operations should decline significantly or if we should accelerate our store expansion or remodeling program  it may be necessary for us to seek additional sources of capital 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our minimum contractual commitments and commercial obligations as of december  payments due in period within after total year years years years in thousands contractual obligations employment contracts operating leases      total      payments due in period within after total year years years years in thousands commercial commitments credit facility letters of credit total quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk relate primarily to changes in interest rates 
we bear the risk in two specific ways 
first  our revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our statement of income and our cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had no borrowing under our credit facility 
however  we may borrow funds under our revolving credit facility as needed 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these investments are included in cash and equivalents as well as marketable securities on our balance sheet 
if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations
