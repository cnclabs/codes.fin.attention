ebitda is defined as earnings before deducting interest expense  income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
although ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management believes that it is useful to an investor in evaluating wabtec because it is widely used as a measure to evaluate a company s operating performance and ability to service debt 
financial covenants in our credit facility include ratios based on ebitda 
ebitda does not purport to represent cash generated by operating activities and should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in addition  because ebitda is not calculated identically by all companies  the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
management s discretionary use of funds depicted by ebitda may be limited by working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements  and by restrictions related to legal requirements  commitments and uncertainties 
the following table sets forth the company s outstanding indebtedness at december  and the revolving credit note and other term loan interest rates are variable and dependent on market conditions 
year ended december  in thousands revolving credit agreement due   senior notes  industrial revenue bond due   other  total   less current portion long term portion   credit agreement in november  wabtec refinanced the then existing unsecured motivepower credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks 
this unsecured credit agreement currently provides a million five year revolving credit facility expiring in november and a day million convertible revolving credit facility maturing in november  with an annual renewal in november in november  the company and the banks negotiated a reduction in the day facility from million to million  as a result of the million  net of tax  cash proceeds from the sale of locomotive businesses to ge 
in november  the company negotiated a further reduction in the day facility from million to million 
at december   the company had available bank borrowing capacity  net of letters of credit  of approximately million 
under the credit agreement  the company may elect a base rate  an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rates of interest libor  a cost of funds rate and a bid rate 
the base rate is the greater of lasalle bank national association s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus per annum 
the libor rate is based on libor plus a margin that ranges from to basis points depending on the company s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios 
the current margin is basis points 
the cost of funds rate is a fluctuating interest rate based on lasalle bank national association s then cost of funds 
under the bid rate option  any participating bank may propose the interest rate at which it will lend funds  which rate may either be a fixed rate or a floating rate based on libor 
the credit agreement limits the company s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions  subject to certain exceptions 
the credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness  mergers  consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions  additional liens  sale and leasebacks  permissible investments  loans and advances  certain debt payments  capital expenditures  and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 
the credit agreement contains customary events of default  including payment defaults  failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material respect  covenant defaults  defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the company  bankruptcy  certain judgments against the company  erisa defaults and change of control of the company 
credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indexes described above 
the maximum credit agreement borrowings  average credit agreement borrowings and weighted average contractual interest rate on credit agreement borrowings was million  million and  respectively for to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable rate debt  the company entered into interest rate swaps which effectively convert a portion of the debt from variable to fixed rate borrowings during the term of the swap contracts 
on december   the notional value of interest rate swaps outstanding totaled million and effectively changed the company s interest rate from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 
the interest rate swap agreements mature in june the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties 
however  since only the cash interest payments are exchanged  exposure is significantly less than the notional amount 
the counterparties are large financial institutions and the company does not anticipate nonperformance 
senior notes in june  the company issued million of senior notes due in the notes 
in january  the company issued an additional million of senior notes due in the notes  the notes and the notes are collectively  the notes 
the notes were issued at a premium resulting in an effective rate of 
the terms of the notes and the notes were substantially the same  and the notes and the notes were issued pursuant to indentures that were substantially the same 
the notes were redeemed at par face on july  through the use of cash on hand and additional borrowings under the credit agreement 
this redemption resulted in an extraordinary non cash loss of million  net of tax  relating to a write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
industrial revenue bond in july  a subsidiary of the company entered into a year million debt obligation that bears an interest rate of and is payable in monthly principal and interest installments 
the proceeds of the bond provided financing for the purchase of a building used in the company s operations 
principal repayments of outstanding loan balances are due at various intervals until maturity 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
the company believes  based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings  cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund its working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting the debt service requirements 
if the company s sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the company s cash requirements  the company may need to refinance its existing debt or obtain additional financing 
there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available  and  in any case  such new financing  if available  would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place 
the company currently expects to refinance and replace its existing bank facility at least twelve months prior to its november expiration 
effects of inflation general price inflation has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations 
some of the company s labor contracts contain negotiated salary and benefit increases and others contain cost of living adjustment clauses  which would cause the company s cost to automatically increase if inflation were to become significant 
conversion to the euro currency on january   certain members of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency the euro 
the company conducts business in member countries 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro is from january  through june  the transition to the euro has not had a material impact on its operations or financial results 
forward looking statements we believe that all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report  including certain statements under business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  may constitute forward looking statements 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events 
although we believe that our assumptions made in connection with the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot assure you that our assumptions and expectations are correct 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risks  uncertainties and assumptions about us  including  among other things economic and industry conditions materially adverse changes in economic or industry conditions generally or in the markets served by us  including north america  south america  europe  australia and asia  demand for services in the freight and passenger rail industry  consolidations in the rail industry  demand for our products and services  continued outsourcing by our customers  demand for freight cars  locomotives  passenger transit cars and buses  industry demand for faster and more efficient braking equipment  fluctuations in interest rates  operating factors supply disruptions  technical difficulties  changes in operating conditions and costs  successful introduction of new products  labor relations  completion and integration of additional acquisitions  the development and use of new technology  competitive factors the actions of competitors  political governmental factors political stability in relevant areas of the world  future regulation deregulation of our customers and or the rail industry  governmental funding for some of our customers  political developments and laws and regulations  such as forced divestiture of assets  restrictions on production  imports or exports  price controls  tax increases and retroactive tax claims  expropriation of property  cancellation of contract rights  and environmental regulations  and transaction or commercial factors the outcome of negotiations with partners  governments  suppliers  customers or others 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
areas of uncertainty that require judgments  estimates and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives  environmental matters  the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment  proceeds on assets to be sold  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and tax matters 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates  and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company s financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
in  wabtec adopted the new standard of accounting for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
the cumulative effect adjustment recognized on january   upon adoption of the new standard  was a charge of million after tax 
also in  amortization ceased for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
total amortization expense recognized was million in  million in and million in additionally  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill 
the company uses a combination of a guideline public company market approach and a discounted cash flow model dcf model to determine the current fair value of the business 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecasted operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volume and pricing  costs to produce and working capital changes 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its business are estimated 
however  actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
other areas of significant judgments and estimates include the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions  including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the long term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases  medical costs  retirement age and mortality 
the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at year end on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan 
the long term rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five year average market value of assets 
the recent declines in equity markets and interest rates have had a negative impact on wabtec s pension plan liability and fair value of plan assets 
as a result  the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets at the end of  which resulted in a million  net of tax  charge to other comprehensive loss in the fourth quarter 
as a global company  wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates 
management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts 
however  the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount 
management does not believe that such a charge would be material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business  wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable rate debt 
after considering the effects of interest rate swaps  further described below  the company s variable rate debt represents of total long term debt at december  and in management has entered into pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swap contracts that partially mitigate the impact of variable rate debt interest rate increases 
at december   an instantaneous basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the company s annual earnings by  assuming no additional intervention strategies by management 
the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 and as amended by sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities effective january  in the application  the company has concluded that its swap contracts qualify for special cash flow hedge accounting which permit recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
this fluctuation is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
foreign currency exchange risk the company occasionally enters into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which the company has significant operations 
as of december   the company had no such instruments outstanding 
wabtec is also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent its operations are conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
for the year ended december   approximately of wabtec s net sales are in the united states  in canada  in mexico  and in other international locations  primarily europe 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
at december   the company does not believe changes in foreign currency exchange rates represent a material risk to results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
wabtec s market risk exposure is not substantially different from its exposure at december  recent accounting pronouncements see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report
