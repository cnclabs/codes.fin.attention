critical accounting policies we consider our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  deferred revenues  internal use software and intangible assets to be critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  see the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we cannot be sure that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
source of revenues and revenue recognition policy our revenues consist of managed services revenues  software revenues  and services revenues 
managed services revenues managed services revenues are derived from agreements that provide for transaction or services fees based on the performance of our managed services solutions 
managed services solutions include the processing of our clients customs entries and the classifying of clients goods 
managed services transaction arrangements are often subject to annual or quarterly minimum transaction thresholds and revenues are recognized based on the lower of the cumulative actual transactions processed during the period using a weighted average transaction rate or the amount billable for the period 
for those managed services transaction arrangements subject to annual minimums and the amount billable for interim periods is limited to the pro rata portion of the annual minimum  transactions processed in excess of the minimum in each period are not billable  and  therefore  revenue is not recognized until the end of the related period 
certain managed services arrangements are based upon a fixed services fee 
revenues associated with these arrangements are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and limited to the amounts billable 
in addition  we may receive annual gainsharing fees under certain managed services arrangements based on a percentage of the client s annual cost savings  as defined in the managed services arrangements 
these fees are recognized when they become fixed and determinable 
managed services transaction minimums and fixed service fees are typically billed monthly 
software revenues software revenues consist of term license revenues  perpetual software license revenues  and transaction based revenues 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software products in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
term license revenues are derived from term software license arrangements in which our clients license our software products and obtain the right to unspecified enhancements on a when and if available basis and ongoing support and content update services 
content updates are significant and frequent 
revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term 
term license arrangements typically range from three to five years 
to the extent we host the software for our customers  the hosting fee is recognized ratably over the contract period in conjunction with the recognition of the license fee 
term license fees are typically billed annually  quarterly or monthly 
perpetual software license revenues are derived from perpetual software license arrangements and related maintenance contracts 
maintenance contracts include the right to unspecified enhancements on a when and if available basis  ongoing support  and content update services 
the content updates provided under maintenance arrangements are significant and frequent  and  as a result  revenues from perpetual software license sales are recognized ratably over the estimated economic life of the product 
we have estimated that the life of the product is three years  which is consistent with the historical periods between major upgrades to the functionality and architecture of our products 
revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term  typically one year 
to the extent we host the software for our customers  the hosting fee is recognized ratably over the contract period in conjunction with the recognition of the license fee 
transaction based revenues are derived from agreements that provide for transaction fees based on a client s usage of our software products 
revenues from the usage of its software products are recognized as transactions occur 
we recognize revenues from arrangements with resellers beginning when the software product is sold to the end user 
annual minimums not sold by the reseller to end customers are recognized as revenues upon the expiration of the annual minimum period 
services revenues services revenues are derived from implementation  management consulting and training services 
services are performed on a time and materials basis or under fixed price arrangements 
revenues on time and materials contracts are recognized based on fixed billable rates for hours delivered  and revenues on fixed priced contracts and are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs to be incurred 
losses on arrangements are recognized when known 
for multiple element arrangements where we provide both software and services  we defer the service fee  based on vendor specific objective evidence  and recognize the services as performed 
deferred revenues deferred revenues include amounts billed to clients for revenues that have not been recognized and generally result from billed  but deferred license revenues and services not yet performed 
deferred revenues will be recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the agreement  the remaining economic life of the product  or when the services are performed 
as we continue to increase our term license and transaction based revenues relative to our perpetual licenses  we expect our deferred revenues to fluctuate since term license and transaction based customers are billed and paid ratably usually either annually  monthly or quarterly 
we do not consider deferred revenue to be an indicator of future revenues 
internal use software in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  we capitalize costs associated with the implementation and integration of our trade management platform to our managed services operations 
judgment is involved in determining which development tasks associated with the platform integration are capitalizable pursuant to sop we capitalized approximately million of direct labor costs in related to certain capitalizable tasks including the technical design  systems configuration and testing phases of the integration process 
these costs are amortized as costs of managed services revenues over three years and amortization commences upon the completion of the integration to the vastera platform 
total amortization expense in was approximately  net capitalized costs as of december  were approximately million 
goodwill and intangible assets as of december   we had recorded goodwill and intangible assets of approximately million related to our acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of january  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in connection with sfas no 
s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement required us to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill resulting from these acquisitions has been impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we were required to identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we were required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit within six months of january  to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of the reporting unit  we would be required to perform the second step of the transitional impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
in the second step  we would be required to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which were measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill would be determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation would be the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
to the extent the implied fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount  we would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
we performed the steps in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of and for the annual assessment in the fourth quarter of the second step was not required in either assessment as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value 
as of january   we had unamortized goodwill of approximately million 
prior to january   goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over its expected economic life  generally four or five years  and assessed for recoverability by determining whether the amortization of the goodwill balance over its remaining life could be recovered through the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired operation 
in the aggregate  amortization of goodwill in and  prior to the adoption of sfas  was approximately million and million  respectively 
on january   in accordance with sfas no 
 we reclassified our assembled workforce intangible assets to goodwill 
prior to january   assembled workforce intangibles were amortized on a straight line basis over two or three years 
the value assigned to the assembled workforce in the acquisition of ford s global customs operation was allocated to each country in which we acquired ford s global customs operations  based upon the number of employees in that country 
the related amortization was to be recorded over three years from the date we assumed ford s customs operations in that country 
our results for prior years have not been restated to reflect the nonamortization approach we adopted for goodwill 
a reconciliation of previously reported net loss and net loss per share for and to the amounts adjusted for the exclusion of goodwill amortization net of the related tax effects  including a comparison of net loss and net loss per share for are as follows in thousands except per share data for the years ended december  reported net loss attributable to common stockholders  goodwill amortization  net of tax   adjusted net loss    basic and diluted net loss per share as reported goodwill amortization  net of tax adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share weighted average common shares    all other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their expected economic lives  generally one to five years 
the value assigned to the ford contract is being amortized as a discount to revenue over the minimum term of the contract 
in the aggregate  amortization of intangible assets in   and was approximately million  million  and  respectively 
in the aggregate  amortization of these identified intangibles for future periods is expected to be approximately million  million  million  million and  for    and  respectively 
the recoverability and useful lives of our intangible assets are based on estimates and are susceptible to change 
although we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability 
reclassifications and revisions effective january   fasb s eitf topic d requires that reimbursed travel expenses be classified as revenue 
consequently  revenues in   and include travel expenses of approximately million million and million  respectively 
all prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the period s presentation 
during the first quarter of  we revised our management reporting process to enable managed services revenues and costs of managed services to be tracked and managed separately 
accordingly  we began reporting revenues and costs of revenues from managed services operations separately from software and services operations 
all prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
as a result of the adoption of fasb no

we expect to pay approximately  in fees to ford each month for reimbursement of these expenses 
in  and  we reimbursed ford approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these payments increased beginning in december when we assumed responsibility for managing ford s operations in europe 
however  we expect payments to decrease in the future as we leverage our existing facilities and employees and deploy our own technology 
net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately million in compared to million in net cash flows used in operating activities reflects the net losses of approximately million and million in and  respectively  and were partially offset by non cash expenses relating to stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization  the provision for doubtful accounts and in process research and development

net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million and million in and  respectively

we will fund these commitments through our current cash resources and our future cash flow from operations

our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the costs and timing of expansion of our operating capabilities  the costs and timing of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  the extent to which our existing and new products and services gain market acceptance  the level and timing of revenues  the costs involved in maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights  and available borrowings under line of credit and capital lease arrangements

we believe that our current cash resources will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next months 
thereafter  we may find it necessary to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
in the event that additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us  if at all

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we develop solutions in the united states and market them in north america  and to a lesser extent  in europe  latin america  and the asia pacific region 
our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
with most of our sales being generated in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries 
we intend to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
amounts outstanding under our term loan arrangement exposes us to interest rate risk if the prime rate increases 
we had approximately million in variable rate debt as of december  our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
we do not hold or issue derivative securities  derivative commodity instruments  or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
