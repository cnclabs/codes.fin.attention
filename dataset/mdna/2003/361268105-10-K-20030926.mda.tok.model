item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto which are included herein 
we utilize a week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest june overview g k services  inc  founded in and headquartered in minnetonka  minnesota  is a market leader in providing corporate identity apparel and facility services programs to a wide variety of north american industrial  service and high technology companies 
we rent uniforms and other related products such as floor mats  dust mops  wiping towels  restroom supplies and selected linen items 
we also sell uniforms and other apparel items to customers in our direct sale programs 
the north american rental market is approximately billion  while the direct sales market  targeted by us  is approximately billion in size 
in fiscal  revenue grew by over fiscal while net income declined by 
revenue growth has continued to be impacted by weak economic conditions and declining employment levels within our existing customer base 
in addition to reduced margins related to lost wearers within our existing customer base  net income was also impacted by higher energy costs  increased employee benefit costs  expenses related to plant closures and employee reductions 
during this period of economic weakness  we were able to generate record levels of cash flow through solid earnings  effective working capital management and prudent capital spending 
we made several small acquisitions in each of the past three fiscal years 
all acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method 
the pro forma effect of these acquisitions  had they been acquired at the beginning of the fiscal year  were not material 
the total purchase consideration  including related acquisition costs of these transactions  was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the total purchase price exceeded the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal while revenue growth and net income continued to be negatively impacted by the difficult economy  higher energy costs and higher employee benefit costs  we aggressively pursued increased sales productivity  operational initiatives and cost reduction opportunities 
these actions have put us in a position of strength for the future while mitigating the impact of the poor economy on our financial results 
critical accounting policies the discussion of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts our rental operations business is largely based on written service agreements whereby we agree to collect  launder and deliver uniforms and other related products 
the service agreements provide for weekly billing upon completion of the laundering process and delivery to the customer 
accordingly  we 
table of contents recognize revenue from rental operations in the period in which the services are provided 
direct sale revenue is recognized in the period in which the product is shipped 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we made a change in the classification of billings to customers for lost or abused merchandise to a preferred classification of including such billings in revenue 
accordingly  all prior period billings for lost or abused garments have been reclassified from a reduction of cost of rental operations to rental operations revenue 
billings reclassified totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal this reclassification did not impact current or historical net income or stockholders equity 
estimates are used in determining the collectibility of billed accounts receivable 
management analyzes specific accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and the age of outstanding balances when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
significant management judgments and estimates are used in connection with establishing the allowance in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of bad debt expense recognition for any given period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
inventories our inventories consist of new goods and rental merchandise in service 
estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to customers or used in rental operations 
historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both obsolete and excess inventories 
new goods are stated at lower of cost or market  net of any reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
merchandise placed in service to support rental operations is amortized into cost of rental operations over the estimated useful lives of the underlying inventory items  primarily on a straight line basis  which results in a matching of the cost of the merchandise with the weekly rental revenue generated by merchandise 
estimated lives of rental merchandise in service range from nine months to three years 
in establishing estimated lives for merchandise in service  management considers historical experience and the intended use of the merchandise 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating profit for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas at the beginning of fiscal and as a result no longer amortize goodwill 
sfas also requires that companies test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned below its carrying amount 
our evaluation considers changes in the operating environment  competitive information  market trends  operating performance and cash flow modeling 
management completes its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and there have been no impairments of goodwill or definite lived intangible assets in fiscal  or future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangibles associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired 
there have been no write downs of any long lived assets in fiscal  or insurance we self insure for certain obligations related to health and workers compensation programs 
we purchase stop loss insurance policies to protect us from catastrophic losses 
estimates are used in 
table of contents determining the potential liability associated with reported claims and for losses that have occurred  but have not been reported 
management estimates consider historical claims experience  escalating medical cost trends  expected timing of claim payments and an actuarial analysis provided by a third party 
during fiscal  we changed certain assumptions utilized in evaluating our self insurance liability and began to apply a discounting factor to estimated future payments 
the impact of these changes was not material to our consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations for any period presented 
changes in the cost of medical care  our ability to settle claims and the estimates and judgment used by management could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any period 
results of operations the percentage relationships to revenues of certain income and expense items for the three fiscal years ended june   june  and june   and the percentage changes in these income and expense items between years are presented in the following table percentage change percentage of revenues years ended between years fy vs

total revenues in fiscal rose to million from million in fiscal rental revenue rose million in fiscal  a increase over fiscal the organic industrial rental growth rate  which is calculated using industrial rental revenue adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate differences and revenue from newly acquired business compared to prior year results  was approximately negative 
rental revenue continues to be negatively impacted by lost uniform wearers due to reduced employment levels within our existing customer base 
direct sale revenue was million in fiscal  an increase over million in fiscal direct sale revenue increased as a result of initiatives to penetrate direct sale opportunities with existing customers such as our annual winter outerwear promotion 
cost of rental and direct sale 
cost of rental operations increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin from rental sales decreased to in fiscal from in the prior year 
rental gross margin declines were largely the result of increasing energy and 
table of contents employee benefit costs  expenses related to plant closures and employee reductions as well as continued lost margin from lower employment levels within our existing customer base 
cost of direct sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin from direct sales decreased in fiscal to from in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was due primarily to product mix and pricing pressures  partially offset by increased volume in conjunction with the successful winter outerwear promotion in the second quarter of fiscal selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  selling and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal expenses related to uncollectible accounts receivable  severance costs  sales and marketing expenses and increasing property and casualty insurance costs drove the majority of the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue

depreciation expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation expense decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal  excluding acquisition of businesses  was million compared to million in fiscal amortization 
amortization expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percent of total revenues  amortization expense increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher debt levels in connection with our acquisition activities throughout fiscal  partially offset by lower effective interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal largely due to decreases in canadian statutory income tax rates 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues in fiscal rose to million from million in fiscal rental revenue rose million in fiscal  a increase over fiscal higher unemployment levels and overall weak economic conditions resulting in continued net reductions of customer employees in uniform negatively impacted revenue growth rates 
these conditions were partially offset through the addition of new customers  penetrating existing customers with a broader mix of product and service offerings and acquisitions 
direct sale revenue was million in fiscal  a increase over million in fiscal the increase in revenue was primarily due to several large customer shipments that occurred primarily in the first half of fiscal cost of rental and direct sale 
cost of rental operations increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin from rental sales improved to in fiscal from in the prior year 
the combinations of improved operational productivity  lower merchandise expense and reduced energy costs contributed to the improved rental gross margin 
we continue to be negatively impacted by increased employee benefit costs and the compounding impact of revenue lost within our existing customer base over the past two years 
cost of direct sales decreased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin from direct sales increased in fiscal to from in fiscal this improvement was largely due to improved merchandise costs and a continued focus on fulfillment operations efficiency 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  selling and administrative 
table of contents expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal sales and marketing expenses aimed at new account growth  new product development and product penetration drove the majority of the increase 
also contributing to the increase were additional bad debt expenses associated with the slow economy

amortization expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percent of total revenues  amortization expense decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the reduction was driven by the adoption of sfas  under which goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized 
the adoption of sfas reduced amortization expense by of a percent of total revenues in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to lower effective interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the reduction was due largely to decreases in canadian statutory income tax rates 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition our primary sources of cash are net cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
primary uses of cash are interest payments on indebtedness  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
operating activities 
net cash provided from operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal solid earnings along with effective working capital management has been a large reason for the high levels of operating cash flow over each of the past three fiscal years 
we have paid particular attention to the timely collection of accounts receivable while exploring options for payments related to trade and accrued payables 
working capital at june  was million  a million decrease from million at june  this decrease is largely due to increases in employment related liabilities including pension and workers compensation 
investing activities 
net cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  and cash was largely used for acquisitions and property  plant and equipment additions 
financing activities 
financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and used cash of million in fiscal cash provided in both fiscal and was from debt proceeds used primarily for acquisitions of businesses 
cash used in fiscal was primarily related to repayment of long term debt 
we paid dividends of million in fiscal and million in each of fiscal and during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into a million term loan and revolving credit facility expiring july  to repay the existing facilities that expired june  the facility provides for a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
as of june   borrowings outstanding under the term loan were million and under the revolving credit facility were million at rates ranging from to 
borrowings under this facility are unsecured 
the unused portion of the revolver may be used for general corporate purposes  acquisitions  working capital needs and to provide up to million in letters of credit 
as of june   letters of credit outstanding against the revolver were million 

table of contents the credit facilities and the fixed rate notes contain various restrictive covenants that among other matters require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum stockholders equity and a maximum leverage ratio  all as defined 
these debt arrangements also provide for certain limits related to additional indebtedness  investments and dividends 
at june   we were in compliance with all debt covenants and only a material adverse change in our financial performance and condition could result in a potential event of default 
in the unlikely event that an event of default would be imminent  management believes that we would be able to successfully negotiate amended covenants or obtain waivers  however  certain financial concessions might be required 
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if amended covenants or waivers in acceptable terms could not be successfully negotiated 
cash obligations 
under various agreements  we are obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts 
these include payments under the variable rate term loan and revolving credit facility  the fixed rate term loan  capital lease obligations and rent payments required under non cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year 
the following table summarizes our fixed cash obligations as of june  for the next five fiscal years and thereafter in thousands and thereafter total variable rate term loan and revolving credit facility fixed rate term loan other debt arrangements  including capital leases operating leases total contractual cash obligations also  at june   we had stand by letters of credit totaling million issued and outstanding  primarily in connection with our property and casualty insurance programs 
no amounts have been drawn upon these letters of credit 
at june   we had available cash on hand of million and approximately million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility 
we anticipate that we will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy our cash commitments and capital requirements for fiscal and to significantly reduce the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility  however  we may utilize borrowings under the revolving credit facility to supplement our cash requirements from time to time 
we estimate that capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million to million 
the amount of cash flow generated from operations is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
in fiscal  we may actively seek and consider acquisitions of business assets  the consummation of any acquisition could affect our liquidity profile and level of outstanding debt 
we believe that our earnings and cash flow from operations  existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain additional debt or equity capital  if necessary  will be adequate to finance suitable acquisition opportunities 
pension obligations we account for our defined benefit pension plan using statement of financial accounting standards no 
employer s accounting for pensions sfas 
under sfas  pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods 
pension expense calculated under sfas is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
we recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plan of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
at june   the fair value of our pension plan assets totaled million 
lower investment returns  benefit payments and declining discount rates have resulted in additional minimum 
table of contents pension liability of million net of tax of million as of june  we anticipate making a cash contribution of approximately million in fiscal the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of critical assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases 
at june   we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long term rate of return of 
this rate is consistent with the assumed rate used at both june  and june  and was developed by evaluating input from our actuary as well as long term inflation assumptions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at june  is based on an allocation of us equities and us fixed income securities 
decreasing the expected long term rate of return by from to would increase our estimated pension expense by approximately million 
pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced 
we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of at june  and at both june  and june  the discount rate is determined based on the current rates earned on high quality long term bonds 
decreasing the discount rate by from to would increase our accumulated benefit obligation at june  by approximately million and increase the estimated fiscal pension expense by approximately million 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
impact of inflation in general  management believes that our results of operations are not dependent on moderate changes in the inflation rate 
historically  we have been able to manage the impacts of more significant changes in inflation rates through our customer relationships  customer agreements that generally provide for price increases consistent with the rate of inflation or  whichever is greater  and continued focus on improvements of operational productivity 
significant increases in energy costs  specifically natural gas and gasoline  can materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
currently  energy costs represent between of our total revenue 
litigation we are involved in a variety of legal actions relating to personal injury  customer contracts  employment  trade practices  environmental and other legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
these legal actions include lawsuits that challenge the practice of charging for certain environmental services on invoices  and being named  along with other defendants  as a potentially responsible party at certain waste disposal sites where ground water contamination has been detected or is suspected 
while we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these legal actions  it is the opinion of management that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method used to account for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we will continue to apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock 
table of contents issued to employees  as the method used to account for stock based compensation  where applicable 
we adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas beginning with the third quarter ended march  cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides companies with a safe harbor when making forward looking statements as a way of encouraging them to furnish their shareholders with information regarding expected trends in their operating results  anticipated business developments and other prospective information 
statements made in this report concerning our intentions  expectations or predictions about future results or events are forward looking statements within the meaning of the act 
these statements reflect our current expectations or beliefs  and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to vary from stated expectations  which could be material and adverse 
given that circumstances may change  and new risks to the business may emerge from time to time  having the potential to negatively impact our business in ways we could not anticipate at the time of making a forward looking statement  you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements  and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
some of the factors that could cause actual results or events to vary from stated expectations include  but are not limited to  the following unforeseen operating risks  the effects of overall economic conditions and employment levels  fluctuations in costs of insurance and energy  acquisition integration costs  the performance of acquired businesses  preservation of positive labor relationships  competition  including pricing  within the corporate identity apparel and facility services industry  and the availability of capital to finance planned growth 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates 
we use financial instruments  including fixed and variable rate debt  as well as interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
interest rate swap agreements are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
assuming the current level of borrowings  a one percentage point increase in interest rates under these borrowings would have increased our interest expense for fiscal by approximately million 
this estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of interest rate swap agreements outstanding at june  on the change in the cost of variable rate debt 

table of contents the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the fair values were estimated by discounting the projected cash flows using the current rate applicable to similar transactions 
for debt obligations  the following table presents principal cash flow and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates by fiscal year 
fixed rate variable rate maturity date amount rate amount rate thereafter total fair value for interest rate swaps  the following table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates by fiscal year 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
notional principal average interest average interest maturity date amount pay rate receive rate thereafter total fair value foreign currency exchange risk we have a significant foreign subsidiary located in canada 
the assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are denominated in the canadian dollar and as such are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
results of operations are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period 
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities are recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in results of operations 
we may periodically hedge firm commitments with our foreign subsidiary  generally with foreign currency contracts 
these agreements are recorded at current market values and the gains and losses are included in earnings 
gains and losses on such transactions were not significant in fiscal notional amounts outstanding under foreign currency contracts at june  were million  all of which will mature during fiscal notional amounts outstanding under foreign currency contracts at june  were million  all of which matured during fiscal no amounts were outstanding under such contracts at june  foreign currency contracts were recorded at fair value as of june
