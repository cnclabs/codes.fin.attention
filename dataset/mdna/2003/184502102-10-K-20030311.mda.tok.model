item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview management s discussion and analysis of the results of operation and financial condition of clear channel communications  inc and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
the discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis 
our reportable operating segments are radio broadcasting which includes all domestic and international radio assets and radio networks  outdoor advertising which includes domestic and international billboards  transit displays  street furniture and other outdoor advertising media  and live entertainment which includes live music  theatrical  family entertainment and motor sports events 
included in the other segment are television broadcasting  sports representation and our media representation business  katz media 
results of operations we evaluate the operating performance of our businesses using several measures  one of them being ebitda as adjusted defined as revenue less divisional operating and corporate expenses 
ebitda as adjusted eliminates the uneven effect of such charges as depreciation and amortization  non operating gains and losses  income taxes and interest across our business segments  as well as in comparison to other companies 
while we and many in the financial community consider ebitda as adjusted to be an important measure of operating performance  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such as operating income and net income 
in addition  our definition of ebitda as adjusted is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we measure the performance of our operating segments and managers based on a pro forma measurement that includes adjustments to the prior period for all current and prior year acquisitions 
adjustments are made to the prior period to include the operating results of the acquisition for the corresponding period of time that the acquisition was owned in the current period 
in addition  results of operations from divested assets are excluded from all periods presented 
we believe this pro forma presentation is the best comparable measure of our operating performance as it includes the performance of assets for the period of time we managed the assets 
our pro forma results are presented in constant us dollars us a currency exchange adjustment is made to the actual foreign revenues and expenses at average foreign exchange rates allowing for comparison of operations independent of foreign exchange movements

both national and local sales of our radio inventory grew and  respectively  over included in the reported basis radio 
table of contents revenue growth is million attributable to new programs and growth to existing programs in our syndicated radio business 
another contributing factor to the reported basis revenue growth was various acquisitions  the most significant of which was ackerley in june our ackerley acquisition accounted for roughly million of the reported basis revenue increase 
we also saw growth in television advertising  which was partially attributable to political advertisements that coincided with the state and federal elections 
further  the strengthening of our international functional currencies against the us dollar contributed approximately million to the reported basis revenue increase 
the reported basis revenue increase was partially offset by a million decline within our entertainment segment primarily from a decline in ticket sales 
on a pro forma basis  revenue increased million for the year ended december  as compared to this increase is largely attributable to increases in our radio and television operations relating to increased demand for our radio inventory and political advertising dollars spent on our television stations 
on a pro forma basis  radio and television revenue grew million and million  respectively 
this increase is partially offset by pro forma revenue declines in our entertainment and outdoor segments of million and million  respectively  caused by attendance declines and weak advertising demand for our outdoor advertising inventory 
our entertainment segment is lagging behind our radio and television businesses in terms of revenue growth primarily from the effects of the recession  september th  as well as a change in the mix of types of events in as compared to our outdoor business is lagging behind our radio and television businesses due to lower inventory demand in as compared to however  looking at the fourth quarter of  we saw the first pro forma basis revenue increase in our outdoor segment  with pro forma revenue growing million compared to the fourth quarter of on a reported basis  divisional operating expenses increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of this increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of ackerley in june  which contributed roughly million to reported divisional operating expenses 
also  we saw a million increase in reported divisional operating expenses in our outdoor segment  resulting from increases in production  maintenance and site lease expense  which includes guarantees on our municipal contracts  and increased salaries resulting from additional account executives hired in of the million increase  million resulted from the new ackerley markets 
further  the strengthening of our international functional currencies against the us dollar contributed approximately million to the reported basis divisional operating expense increase 
these increases were partially offset by a million decline in divisional operating expenses within our entertainment segment related to variable expense declines connected to the decline in revenue within this segment 
on a pro forma basis  divisional operating expenses decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the pro forma decline is attributable to a million and million decline in our entertainment and radio segments  respectively 
the radio decline is attributable to declines in discretionary spending and bad debt expense 
the entertainment decline is attributable to variable expense declines connected to the decline in revenue within this segment 
additionally  we incurred reorganizational expenses during relating to severance  hiring costs  expenses associated with the shutdown of business units  certain contract costs  as well as additional non cash promotion expenses  totaling approximately million 
corporate expenses corporate expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to a decrease in corporate head count and facilities and other cost cutting measures 
we closed the amfm corporate offices in dallas on march  and a portion of the sfx offices in new york were closed on june  the decrease was partially offset by an increase in performance based bonus expense as well as higher corporate legal expenses 
non cash compensation non cash compensation expense relates largely to unvested stock options assumed in mergers that are now convertible into clear channel stock 
to the extent that these employees options continue to vest  we recognize non cash compensation expense over the remaining vesting period 
vesting dates vary through april if no employees forfeit their unvested options by leaving the company  we expect to recognize non cash compensation expense of approximately million during the remaining vesting period 

table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased billion for the year ended december  as compared to upon our adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
on january   we no longer amortize goodwill and fcc licenses 
for the year ended december   goodwill and fcc license amortization was approximately billion 
the following table sets forth what depreciation and amortization expense would have been if we had adopted statement on january  and compares it to amortization expense for the year ended december  in millions year ended december  reported depreciation and amortization expense less indefinite lived amortization adjusted depreciation and amortization expense the decrease in adjusted depreciation and amortization expense relates mostly to asset impairments as well as write offs related to duplicative or excess assets identified in our radio segment and charged to expense during the majority of the duplicative or excess assets identified in the radio segment resulted from the integration of prior acquisitions 
also  we recognized impairment charges in related to analog television equipment 
finally  during the second quarter of  a talent contract became fully amortized  which had contributed million in amortization expense in these decreases were partially offset by additional depreciation expense related to assets acquired in the ackerley acquisition in june interest expense interest expense was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of million 
this decrease was due to a decrease in our total debt outstanding as well as an overall decrease in libor rates 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our debt was variable rate debt that bears interest based upon libor 
the following table sets forth our debt outstanding  the percentage of our debt that is variable rate debt and the month libor rates at december  and in millions december  total debt outstanding variable rate debt total debt outstanding month libor gain loss on sale of assets related to mergers the gain loss on sale of assets related to mergers for the year ended december  and was a million gain and a million loss  respectively 
the gain on sale of assets related to mergers in resulted from the sale of shares of entravision corporation that we acquired in the amfm merger 
the net loss on sale of assets related to mergers in was as follows in millions loss related to the sale of million shares of lamar advertising company that we acquired in the amfm merger net loss related to write downs of investments acquired in mergers gain realized on the sale of five stations in connection with governmental directives regarding the amfm merger net loss on sale of assets related to mergers gain loss on marketable securities the gain loss on marketable securities for the year ended december  was a loss of million as compared to a gain of million for the year ended december  
table of contents during  we entered into a secured forward exchange contract that monetized part of our investment in american tower corporation amt 
to partially offset the movement in the fair value of the contract  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 we reclassified million shares of amt from an available for sale classification to a trading classification 
as a result of the reclassification  a million pre tax unrealized holding gain was recorded 
the fair value adjustment of the amt trading shares and the secured forward exchange contract netted a gain of million during these gains were partially offset by million of impairment charges recorded on investments that had declines in their market values that were considered to be other than temporary 
the net loss recorded during relates to the aggregate million gain on the net fair value adjustments of the amt trading shares and the secured forward exchange contract  an aggregate million gain on the sale of shares in foreign media companies  offset by a million impairment charge recorded on an available for sale investment in a domestic media company that had a decline in its market value that was considered to be other than temporary 
equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in our share of net income 
our nonconsolidated affiliates adopted statement during the year which resulted in less amortization expense related to indefinite lived intangibles 
the increase was partially offset by impairment charges related to various international equity investments that had declines in value that were considered to be other than temporary 
other income expense net for the years ended december  and  other income expense net was income of million and million  respectively 
the income recognized in related primarily to a million aggregate gain recognized on the sale of a television license  the sale of assets in our live entertainment segment and the sale of our interest in a british radio license  a million gain recognized on the early extinguishment of debt  a million gain on the sale of representation contracts  a million foreign exchange loss  a million loss on sale of assets in our radio and outdoor segments  and a million loss on various other items 
the income related primarily to a million gain on a non cash  tax free exchange of the assets of one television station for the assets of two television stations 
income taxes income taxes for the years ended december  and were provided at our federal and state statutory rates adjusted for the effects of permanent tax items 
during  as a result of our large amounts of non deductible goodwill amortization  our effective tax rate was adversely impacted 
as we no longer amortize goodwill  our effective tax rate for more closely approximated our statutory tax rates 
income loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  was income of million and was a loss of billion for the year ended december  income loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for  if we had adopted statement as of january   would have been income of million 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle the loss recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during relates to our adoption of statement on january  statement required that we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment using a fair value approach 
as a result of the goodwill test  we recorded a non cash  net of tax  impairment charge of approximately billion 
also  as a result of the indefinite lived intangible test  we recorded a non cash  net of tax  impairment charge on our fcc licenses of approximately billion 
as required by statement  a subsequent impairment test was performed at october   which resulted in no additional impairment charge 

table of contents the non cash impairments of our goodwill and fcc licenses were generally caused by unfavorable economic conditions  which persisted in the industries we served throughout this weakness contributed to our customers reducing the number of advertising dollars spent on our media inventory and live entertainment events 
these conditions adversely impacted the cash flow projections used to determine the fair value of our licenses and each reporting unit at january  these factors resulted in the non cash impairment charge of a portion of our licenses and goodwill

consistent with the widespread growth across our markets  our national and local revenue increased and  respectively  on a reported basis for as compared to this growth was spurred by growth in our auto  retail  telecom utility  consumer products and entertainment advertising categories 
audience reach is an important part of our ability to set rates because it is an indication of how many listeners will hear our customers advertisements 
reach is measured in individual markets by audience surveys 
while ratings across all of our markets are the ultimate determinate of the health of our radio business  we generate approximately half of our radio revenues from our top markets 
therefore  we took a snapshot of our ratings from these markets based on the percentage of people in the market over twelve years old who listened to our stations in an average quarter hour for the six months ending in the fall of based on this demographic  our ratings improved in twelve of the twenty markets  were down in six of the twenty markets and were flat in the other markets as compared to the summer of

table of contents revenue related to our less significant and acquisitions as well as the increase related to sfx and amfm were offset due to reasons discussed below in our pro forma presentation 
our sfx and amfm acquisitions account for approximately billion and million  respectively  of the total billion increase in reported divisional operating expenses 
in addition to this increase  reported divisional operating expenses increased due to our less significant and acquisitions as well as the reasons discussed below in our pro forma presentation 
pro forma revenue decreased million or in fiscal year due to an overall softening of the advertising industry  especially as compared to the strong advertising environment during the majority of during  advertising rates were lower in our radio and outdoor business related to the decreased inventory demand within the advertising industry 
as the advertising environment softens  advertising rates decline and inventory demands weaken 
although the decrease in pro forma revenue was apparent in most markets  of the million decline  our top domestic radio and outdoor markets accounted for approximately million  or of the total decline 
the decline in pro forma revenue within these markets was predominately due to the decline in national advertising during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year similarly  our radio network revenue  which is primarily national sales  declined approximately million  or of the total decline during as compared to  again directly related to the decline in the overall economy 
the decline in pro forma revenue was partially offset by an million increase in pro forma revenue within our live entertainment division 
during  we changed the mix of live music events within this division to include approximately more stadium and arena events as compared to the prior year 
stadium and arenas are generally larger venues that allow for more ticket sales related to the increased seating capacity

divisional operating expenses also increased during within the outdoor division related to new contract payments  and within our other segment associated with increases in television contract payments 
these increases in pro forma divisional operating expenses were partially offset by the reduction in selling costs associated with the decline in pro forma revenue in also  as discussed below  the terrorist attacks on september  negatively impacted the overall operating results for the later part of fiscal year as compared to the later part of fiscal year corporate expenses increased million on a reported basis primarily due to million of additional expense directly related to additional corporate employees obtained in our acquisitions 
in addition  corporate expenses increased due to the additional corporate employees hired subsequent to our acquisitions to accommodate for the growth of the company 
as a result of our acquisitions  we increased corporate head count throughout to employees as compared to employees at the end of fiscal year other income and expense information non cash compensation expense of million and million was recorded in fiscal year and  respectively 
this expense is primarily due to unvested stock options assumed in mergers that are now convertible into clear channel stock 
to the extent that these employees options continue to vest  we recognize non cash compensation expense over the remaining vesting period 
vesting dates range from january to april if no employees forfeit their unvested options by leaving the company  we expect to recognize non cash compensation expense of approximately million during the remaining vesting period 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense increased from billion in to billion in  an increase

this gain for was partially offset by a loss of million related to the sale of million shares of lamar advertising company that we acquired in the amfm merger  and a net loss of million related to write downs of investments acquired in mergers 
the gain on marketable securities is primarily related to the reclassification of million shares of american tower corporation to a trading security under financial accounting standards no

at maturity  we converted the facility into a three year term loan with a maturity of august  at december   the outstanding balance was billion 
during the year ended december   we made principal payments totaling billion and drew down billion on these credit facilities 
as of february   the credit facilities aggregate outstanding balance was billion and  taking into account outstanding letters of credit  billion was available for future borrowings 
international credit facility we have a million five year revolving credit facility with a group of international banks 
this facility allows for borrowings in various foreign currencies  which are used to hedge net assets in those currencies and provides funds to our international operations for certain working capital needs and smaller acquisitions 
at december   approximately million was available for future borrowings and million was outstanding 
this credit facility expires on december  liquid yield option notes we assumed liquid yield option notes lyons due as a part of the merger with jacor 
each lyon has a principal amount at maturity of  and is convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity  into our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per lyon 
the lyons balance  after conversions to common stock  amortization of purchase accounting premium and accretion of interest  at december  was million  which includes an unamortized fair value purchase accounting premium of million 
we could purchase the lyons  at the option of the holder  on february  for a purchase price of per lyon  representing a yield per annum to the holder on such date 
at february    lyons were put to us  which we purchased for an aggregate price of million 
long term bonds on january   we redeemed all of the outstanding exchange debentures due  originally issued by sfx broadcasting for million plus accrued interest 
during the year ended december   we also repurchased million of convertible notes prior to their maturity at december  and million of various outstanding notes and convertible notes with maturities prior to december  we utilized availability on the reducing revolving line of credit to finance these redemptions 
these transactions resulted in a million gain recorded in other income expense net 
in addition  billion of our convertible notes matured on december  on february   we called all of the outstanding senior subordinated notes due  originally issued by chancellor media corporation of los angeles for million plus accrued interest 
on february   we called all of the outstanding senior subordinated notes due  originally issued by chancellor radio broadcasting company for million plus accrued interest 

table of contents guarantees of third party obligations as of december  and  we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately million and million  respectively  primarily related to long term operating contracts 
the third parties associated operating assets secure a substantial portion of these obligations 
at december   we guaranteed the third party performance under a certain contract for approximately million that expires in common stock warrants we assumed common stock warrants  with an expiration date of february   as a part of our merger with jacor 
each warrant represented the right to purchase 
shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per full share 
during the first quarter of  we received million in proceeds and issued 
million shares of common stock on the exercise of these warrants 
sale of investments during  we liquidated our position in entravision corporation  which we acquired in the amfm merger 
as a result of the sale  we received million in proceeds and recorded a gain of million  which is recorded in gain on sale of assets related to mergers 
also during  we sold our interest in a british radio license and various media companies 
as a result of these sales  we received million in proceeds and recorded a gain of million  which was recorded in other income expense net  and a gain of million recorded in gain loss on marketable securities 
shelf registration on march   we filed a registration statement on form s covering a combined billion of debt securities  junior subordinated debt securities  preferred stock  common stock  warrants  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units the shelf registration statement 
the shelf registration statement also covers preferred securities that may be issued from time to time by our three delaware statutory business trusts and guarantees of such preferred securities by us 
the sec declared this shelf registration statement effective on april  on january   we completed a debt offering of million notes due january  and million notes due january  interest is payable on january and july on both series of notes 
the aggregate net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facilities and to finance the redemption of amfm operating  inc s outstanding senior subordinated notes due december  and senior subordinated notes due june  the amfm notes were redeemed pursuant to call provisions in the indentures 
debt covenants our most significant covenants relate to leverage ratio and interest coverage contained and defined in the credit facilities 
the leverage ratio covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total debt to ebitda both defined by the credit facilities of less than x through june  and less than x from july  through the maturity of the facilities 
the interest coverage covenant requires us to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda as defined by the credit facilities to interest expense of x 
in the event that we do not meet these covenants  we are considered to be in default on the credit facilities at which time the credit facilities may become immediately due 
at december   our leverage and interest coverage ratios were x and x  respectively 
including our cash and cash equivalents recorded at december   our leverage on a net debt basis was x 
our bank credit facilities have cross default provisions among the bank facilities only 
no other clear channel debt agreements have cross default or cross acceleration provisions 
additionally  the amfm long term bonds contain certain restrictive covenants that limit the ability of amfm operating inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of clear channel  to incur additional indebtedness  enter into 
table of contents certain transactions with affiliates  pay dividends  consolidate or effect certain asset sales 
the amfm long term bonds have cross default and cross acceleration provisions among the amfm long term bonds only 
our domestic credit facilities include a provision for an increase in fees of basis points on borrowings and basis points on amounts available for future borrowings in the event that both of our long term debt ratings drop below our current ratings of bbb baa conversely  if our long term debt ratings improve  we have a proportionate decrease in fees 
our million international credit facility includes a put option in the event that our long term debt ratings fall below bb ba we believe there are no other agreements that contain provisions that trigger an event upon a change in long term debt ratings that would have a material impact to our financial statements 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
we expect to remain in compliance throughout uses of capital acquisitions ackerley merger on june   we consummated our merger with the ackerley group  inc ackerley 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  each share of ackerley ordinary and class b common stock was exchanged for shares of our common stock 
after canceling million shares of ackerley common stock that we held prior to the signing of the merger agreement  approximately million shares of our common stock were issued to ackerley shareholders 
we also assumed all of ackerley s outstanding employee stock options  which at the time of the merger were exercisable for approximately  shares of our common stock 
the merger was valued at approximately million based on the number of our common shares issued  which were at the average share price at the signing of the merger agreement  the historical cost of the ackerley shares we held prior to the merger date and the fair value of the employee stock options at the merger date 
in addition  we assumed all of ackerley s outstanding debt  which had a fair value of million at the merger date 
we refinanced ackerley s credit facility and made a tender offer for ackerley s public debt concurrent with the merger 
the tender offer was finalized on july  at a price of  per  tendered  resulting in the repurchase of substantially all of ackerley s public debt 
this merger resulted in the recognition of approximately million of goodwill 
this purchase price allocation is preliminary pending completion of third party appraisals and other fair value analysis of assets and liabilities 
the results of operations of ackerley have been included in the company s financial statements beginning june  other in addition to the acquisition of ackerley  during the year ended december  we acquired radio stations in markets for million in cash and million in restricted cash 
we also acquired approximately outdoor display faces in domestic markets and approximately  display faces in six international markets for a total of million in cash 
our outdoor segment also acquired investments in nonconsolidated affiliates for a total of million in cash 
during the year ended december   our live entertainment segment acquired music  racing events  promotional and exhibition related assets for million in cash primarily related to deferred consideration on prior year acquisitions 
also  our national representation business acquired new contracts for a total of million in cash and our television business acquired broadcasting assets for million in cash during the year ended december  future acquisitions of radio broadcasting stations  outdoor advertising facilities  live entertainment assets and other media related properties affected in connection with the implementation of our acquisition strategy are expected to be financed from increased borrowings under our existing credit facilities  additional public equity and debt offerings and cash flow from operations 

table of contents capital expenditures capital expenditures in decreased from million in to million in overall  capital expenditures decreased in as compared to due to less recurring capital expenditures in our outdoor and corporate and other segments  partially offset by small increases in recurring capital expenditures in our radio and entertainment segments 
in addition  capital expenditures decreased due to less integration and consolidation of our operations during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in our capital expenditures related to revenue producing assets primarily in our outdoor segment 
in millions year ended december  capital expenditures corporate and radio outdoor entertainment other total recurring non recurring projects revenue producing our radio broadcasting capital expenditures decreased million during the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to less consolidation of operations in certain markets in conjunction with our prior acquisitions that are expected to result in improved results in such markets 
our outdoor advertising capital expenditures increased million during the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to additional construction of new revenue producing advertising displays 
our live entertainment capital expenditures decreased million during the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to a higher spending in relating to a consolidated sales and operations facility 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in spending relating to new venues 
our corporate and other capital expenditures decreased million during the year ended december  as compared to primarily related to additional spending in related to the purchase of certain corporate assets and upgrades of our television related operating assets as well as other technology expenditures 
income taxes during the year ended december   we utilized tax net operating loss carryforwards  which reduced our current tax expense and cash tax payments by million 
in addition  we received approximately million in related to tax refund payments 
during the year ended december   we made cash tax payments of million relating to gains realized on divested radio stations during deferred income taxes changed from a benefit of million for the year ended december  to an expense of million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of adopting statement as we no longer amortize fcc licenses  we will no longer recognize a deferred tax benefit for the difference between book and tax amortization on our fcc licenses 
the deferred tax liability on the balance sheet will not reverse over time unless we impair or sell our fcc licenses 
in addition to the effects of statement  the residual increase in deferred tax expense for related to additional tax deductions taken on our federal tax return  filed on september   compared to the amount recorded at december   which resulted in million of deferred tax expense 
the deductions in excess of those previously estimated on the tax provision relate to recent changes in the tax laws associated primarily with tax depreciation 
finally  during  the following deferred tax benefits expenses were recorded which related to unusual transactions not expected to reoccur in the near future million deferred tax benefit associated with a lawsuit settlement  million deferred tax expense associated with the utilization of acquired net operating

pending transaction on june   univision communications  inc  a spanish language television group  announced that it would acquire hispanic broadcasting in a stock for stock merger 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  each share of hispanic will be exchanged for 
shares of univision 
as we currently own of hispanic  we account for this investment using the equity method of accounting 
once this merger is completed  we will own less than of the combined company 
as a result  we will no longer account for this investment using the equity method of accounting  but instead will account for this investment as a cost investment 
upon the consummation of this merger  we will carry this investment at its fair market value 
assuming a market price of per univision share on the date of this merger  we would record a pre tax gain of approximately million 
the merger is subject to approval by the fcc 
commitments and contingencies we were among the defendants in a lawsuit filed on june  in the united states district court for the southern district of florida by spanish broadcasting system 
the plaintiffs alleged that we were in violation of section one and section two of the sherman antitrust act as well as various claims such as unfair trade practices  defamation among other counts 
this case was dismissed with prejudice on january  the plaintiffs have filed with the court for reconsideration 
there are various other lawsuits and claims pending against us 
we believe that any ultimate liability resulting from those actions or claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
certain agreements relating to acquisitions provide for purchase price adjustments and other future contingent payments based on the financial performance of the acquired companies generally over a one to five year period 
we will continue to accrue additional amounts related to such contingent payments if and when it is determinable that the applicable financial performance targets will be met 
the aggregate of these contingent payments  if performance targets are met  would not significantly impact our financial position or results of operations 
future obligations in addition to our scheduled maturities on our debt  we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts 
we lease office space  certain broadcast facilities  equipment and the majority of the land occupied by our outdoor advertising structures under long term operating leases 
in addition  we have minimum franchise payments associated with non cancelable contracts that enable us to display advertising on such media as buses  taxis  trains  bus shelters and terminals as well as other contracts 
finally  we have commitments relating to required purchases of property  plant and equipment under certain street furniture contracts  as well as construction commitments for facilities and venues 
the scheduled maturities of our credit facilities  other long term debt outstanding  future minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating lease agreements  minimum rental payments under non cancelable contracts and capital expenditure commitments at december  are as follows 
table of contents in thousands non other cancelable non credit long term operating cancelable capital facilities debt leases contracts expenditures thereafter total during the year ended december   we repurchased million of our outstanding notes and convertible notes with maturities prior to december  market risk interest rate risk at december   approximately of our long term debt  including fixed rate debt on which we have entered into interest rate swap agreements  bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a two percentage point change in the year s average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense would have changed by million and that our net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management may take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this interest rate analysis assumes no such actions 
further the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively float interest at rates based upon libor on billion of our current fixed rate borrowings 
these agreements expire from september to june the fair value of these agreements at december  was an asset of million 
equity price risk the carrying value of our available for sale and trading equity securities is affected by changes in their quoted market prices 
it is estimated that a change in the market prices of these securities would change their carrying value at december  by million and would change accumulated comprehensive income loss and net income loss by million and 
million  respectively 
at december   we also held million of investments that do not have a quoted market price  but are subject to fluctuations in their value 
foreign currency we have operations in countries throughout the world 
foreign operations are measured in their local currencies except in hyper inflationary countries in which we operate 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to risk of international currency fluctuations  we maintain a natural hedge through borrowings in currencies other than the us dollar 
this hedge position is reviewed monthly 
we currently maintain no derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
our foreign operations reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to foreign currencies would change net loss for the year ended december  by 
million 

table of contents our earnings are also affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of our investments in various countries  all of which are accounted for under the equity method 
it is estimated that the result of a fluctuation in the value of the dollar relative to these foreign currencies at december  would change our equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates by million and would change our net income for the year ended december  by approximately million 
this analysis does not consider the implications that such fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the us or the foreign countries or on the results of operations of these foreign entities

we adopted the disclosure provisions required in statement and have provided the necessary disclosures within note j of our audited financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of a financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
the following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit  adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the agings and changes in current economic conditions 
revenue recognition radio broadcasting revenue is recognized as advertisements or programs are broadcast and is generally billed monthly 
outdoor advertising provides services under the terms of contracts covering periods up to three years  which are generally billed monthly 
revenue for outdoor advertising space rental is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
advertising revenue is reported net of agency commissions 
agency commissions are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue for our broadcasting and outdoor operations 
clients remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits gross billings less their commission to the company 
payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred income 
entertainment revenue from the presentation and production of an event is recognized on the date of the performance 
revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred income until the event occurs 
entertainment revenue collected from advertising and other revenue  which is not related to any single event  is classified as deferred revenue and generally amortized over the operating season or the term of the contract 
purchase accounting we account for our business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  asset lives and market multiples  among other items 
in addition  reserves have been established on our balance sheet related to acquired liabilities and qualifying restructuring costs based on assumptions made at the time of acquisition 
we evaluate these reserves on a regular basis to determine the adequacies of the amounts 

table of contents long lived assets we record impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that depreciable and amortizable long lived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect their current fair market value 
we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these assets  including future expected cash flows and discount rates  as well as future salvage values 
in the first quarter of  we adopted statement  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with statement  we tested our fcc licenses for impairment as of january  by comparing their fair value to their carrying value at that date 
we recorded an impairment charge of our fcc licenses of approximately billion  net of deferred tax of billion 
we used an income approach to value the fcc licenses 
we also recorded an impairment charge of our goodwill of approximately billion  net of deferred taxes of million 
similar to our test for impairment of fcc licenses  we used the income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
the fair value of our reporting units was used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit 
to the extent that the net assets exceeded the fair value  an impairment charge was recorded 
the income approach used for valuing goodwill and fcc licenses involved estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets  discounted to their present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
terminal values were also estimated and discounted to their present value 
the fair values calculated were significantly impacted by the assumptions made  which impacted our impairment charge 
in accordance with statement  we performed our first annual impairment test as of october  on fcc licenses and goodwill 
no impairment charges resulted from these tests 
we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under statement to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase  respectively 
accounting for investments at december   we had million recorded as other investments 
other investments are composed primarily of equity securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale or trading and are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices 
securities are carried at historical value when quoted market prices are unavailable 
the net unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities  net of tax  are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the net unrealized gains or losses on trading securities are reported in the statement of operations 
in addition  we hold investments that do not have quoted market prices 
we review the value of these investments and record an impairment charge in the statement of operations for any decline in value that is determined to be other than temporary 
for the twelve months ended december  and  we recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  related to other than temporary declines in value of various media companies 
in addition  at december   we had million recorded as investments accounted for under the equity method 
we review the value of these investments and record an impairment charge in the statement of operations for any decline in value that is determined to be other than temporary 
tax accruals the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities routinely examine our tax returns 
from time to time  the irs challenges certain of our tax positions 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the irs could require us to make additional tax payments 
we believe that we have adequately accrued for any foreseeable payments resulting from tax examinations and consequently do not anticipate any material impact upon their ultimate resolution 
litigation accruals we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it 
table of contents is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for wages  salaries and equipment 
although the exact impact of inflation is indeterminable  we believe we have offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our broadcasting stations and outdoor display faces 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows year ended december  for the year ended december   fixed charges exceeded earnings before income taxes and fixed charges by billion 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total enterprise basis 
earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of unconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges 
fixed charges represent interest  amortization of debt discount and expense  and the estimated interest portion of rental charges 
we had no preferred stock outstanding for any period presented
