overview duratek  inc  together with its wholly owned subsidiaries the company or duratek  provides safe  secure radioactive materials disposition and nuclear facility operations for commercial and government customers 
the company s operations are organized into three primary segments i federal services  ii commercial services  and iii commercial processing and disposal 
the company s federal services operations primarily provide on site waste processing and disposal services  off site waste disposition  on site management of nuclear facility operations  and on site clean up remedial action services on large government projects for the united states department of energy doe and other governmental entities 
the company s services include program development  project management  nuclear facility operation  waste characterization  packaging and shipping of waste  selected technical services  and site cleanup 
revenues derived from the company s federal services operations represented approximately   and of the company s total revenues during   and  respectively 
the company s commercial services operations provide waste treatment and disposition services to a diverse group of commercial clients  including nuclear power utilities 
these services include water processing  nuclear waste handling and treatment  transportation  licensing  packaging  heavy hauling  disposal  and nuclear facility decontamination and decommissioning d d 
revenues derived from commercial services operations represented approximately   and of the company s total revenues during   and  respectively 
the company conducts its commercial processing and disposal operations at its three tennessee locations the bear creek operations facility in oak ridge  the company s facility in memphis  and the gallaher road operations facility in kingston 
the company also operates two facilities in barnwell  south carolina the duratek consolidation services facility dcsf and the barnwell low level radioactive waste management disposal facility 
the technologies used at the tennessee based processing operations include incineration  compaction  metal decontamination and recycling  and green is clean 
revenues derived from the company s commercial processing and disposal operations represented approximately   and of the company s total revenues in   and  respectively 
the company incurred a substantial operating loss in primarily as a result of operational problems experienced at the company s bear creek facility and the company s memphis facility during the fourth quarter of the operational problems at these facilities and related losses on two significant contracts also adversely affected the company s results for  particularly in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
the results included a million provision for loss on a large component project and a million accrual for costs associated with various high radiation customer waste 
the company s management has aggressively addressed these operational issues 
among other things  the company has strengthened management resources and reporting  implemented personnel changes  modified waste processing  storage  transportation and burial methods  and improved cost accounting systems utilized at its commercial waste processing facilities 
while management believes that these efforts were effective in and will prevent reoccurrence of the events that led to losses in its commercial waste processing operations in and  no assurance can be given that some or all of the factors that led to these losses might not have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
the company s future operating results will be affected by  among other things  the duration of commercial waste processing contracts and amount of waste to be processed by the company s commercial waste processing operations pursuant to these contracts and the timing and scope of doe waste treatment projects 
in june  the company acquired the nuclear services business of waste management  inc which business is referred to as wmns 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to cost to complete long term contracts  the cost to d d facilities and equipment  the recoverability of long lived assets including goodwill  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex  or subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policies  which relate to revenue recognition  d d liabilities  and recoverability of long lived assets including goodwill  are discussed below 
revenue recognition commercial waste processing the commercial waste processing operations have short term and long term contracts with commercial companies to provide waste processing services 
the company s services are primarily provided under fixed unit price contracts 
under the fixed unit price contracts  revenue is recognized as waste is processed 
the company records the associated costs with out bound transportation  burial  and secondary waste processing as the related waste is processed 
the company s fixed unit price contracts provide for additional customer billings if the characterization of the waste received is different from contract specifications or for certain increases in burial costs  both of which are estimated at the time of waste processing 
contract revenue and cost recognition the federal services and commercial services operations have long term contracts to provide engineering and technical support services to the federal government and its agencies and to commercial companies 
the company s services are provided under time and materials  cost plus fixed fee and fixed price contracts 
under time and materials contracts the company records revenues based on hours incurred at agreed upon contractual rates 
for cost plus fixed fee contracts the company records revenue based upon costs incurred and a proportionate amount of the fixed fee or percentage stipulated in the contract 
for fixed price contracts  the company recognizes revenue based upon applying the ratio of current cumulative costs incurred to total estimated cost at completion 
the company considers the nature of the work involved in determining whether such measures are appropriate 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
the resulting difference is recognized as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  a current asset  or unearned revenues  a current liability 
contracts typically provide for billing of costs incurred and estimated earnings on a monthly or quarterly basis 
the estimates of revenues and expenses on client contracts change periodically in the normal course of business and due to contract modifications 
the company receives award fees on certain federal government contracts which are accrued when estimable and collection is reasonably assured 
provisions for estimated losses on individual contracts are made in the period in which the loss was identified 
contract acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract estimates  involves inherent risk 
the company reduces the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates through corporate policy  approval and monitoring processes  which includes a detailed monthly review and status report to management of all significant contracts with such risk 
d d liabilities the company has responsibility related to the cost to d d the facilities and equipment in tennessee and south carolina and equipment used at customer sites in the commercial services operations 
such costs will generally be paid upon closure of such facilities or disposal of such equipment 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
similarly  under its license granted by the state of south carolina and the atlantic interstate low level radioactive waste compact implementation act  the company will be obligated for costs associated with the ultimate closure of the barnwell low level radioactive waste disposal facility in south carolina and its buildings and equipment located at the barnwell site 
the company has recorded accruals related to these d d liabilities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires the company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation aro as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
the company is also required to record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the aro  the aro will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
the company adopted sfas no 
on january   as required  and recognized the following changes to the company s consolidated financial statements increase property  plant and equipment by million and increase facility and equipment d d liabilities by million 
the pre tax difference of million million after tax was recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s first quarter results 
management updates its closure and remediation cost estimates for d d on an annual basis 
these estimates are based on current technology  regulations  and burial rates 
management is unable to reasonably estimate the impact that changes in technology  regulations  and burial rates will have on the ultimate costs 
changes in these factors could have a material impact on these estimates 
recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill the company has made significant business acquisitions for which it has recorded the fair value of long lived assets acquired and related goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company reviews long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  on january  under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but rather tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with the sfas no 
as of december   the company had million of goodwill and million of intangible assets with estimable useful lives on its consolidated balance sheet 
the company does not have any other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
in connection with sfas no 
s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement required the company to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill was impaired on the date of adoption 
the company was required to identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
the carrying amount of each reporting unit was then compared with the determined fair value of each reporting unit 
for each reporting unit  the determined fair value exceeded the carrying value and the second step of the impairment test was not required 
the company will test its goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate an impairment  under the provisions of sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount of excess carrying value over fair value
