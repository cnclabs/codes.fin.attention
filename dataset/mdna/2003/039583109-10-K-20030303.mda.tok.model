our operating results depend primarily on income from apartment communities  which is substantially influenced by supply and demand for apartment units  operating expense levels  property level operations and the pace and price at which we develop  acquire or dispose of apartment communities 
capital and credit market conditions  which affect our cost of capital  also influence operating results 
see risk factors in item of this annual report for a complete discussion of the various risk factors that could affect our future performance 
the company we are a public equity reit that is engaged primarily in the acquisition  development  management and operation of apartment communities throughout the united states 
we are structured as an upreit  under which substantially all property ownership and business operations are conducted through the operating trust 
table of contents and its subsidiaries and affiliates 
archstone smith is the sole trustee and owns approximately of the operating trust 
the smith merger during october  shareholders of both archstone and smith residential a publicly traded reit which primarily developed  owned and managed high rise apartment properties and garden apartment communities in washington  d 
c  chicago  boston and southeast florida approved the smith merger 
the combined company operates under the name archstone smith trust and is traded on the nyse under the symbol asn 
the total purchase price paid for smith residential aggregated approximately billion and corresponds to a purchase price of approximately  per operating apartment unit acquired 
this transaction was structured as a tax free merger and was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
during  all remaining purchase accounting adjustments were finalized 
adjustments to the initial purchase price allocation were less than one percent of the purchase price 
in accordance with the terms of the smith merger which closed on october  the operating trust acquired smith partnership s assets and assumed their debt and other liabilities upon consummation of the smith merger 
smith residential s common shareholders received common shares in exchange for each surrendered share of common stock and smith residential s preferred shareholders received one archstone smith preferred share for each surrendered preferred share 
smith partnership s common unit holders received a common units in exchange for each surrendered common unit and smith partnership s preferred unit holders received one operating trust preferred unit for each surrendered preferred unit 
in addition to approving the smith merger  archstone s shareholders also approved the following matters on october  i an amendment to archstone s declaration of trust  ii the conversion of archstone into an upreit structure  and  iii the merger of the operating trust with the smith partnership 
we believe the upreit structure significantly enhances our acquisition capabilities 
with this structure  sellers are able to contribute their properties to the operating trust in exchange for a common units  which allows them to realize significant tax deferral benefits while achieving economic returns similar to directly holding common shares 
over time  the contributors can redeem their a common units for readily tradable common shares or cash  triggering a taxable event 
this allows the contributors to incur their tax liabilities in smaller increments  at a time of their choosing 
a common units are redeemable for cash or  at our option  for an equal number of common shares and receive dividends equal to those paid on the common shares 
as a result of the smith merger  our board and management believe that the combined company has the following important attributes i we own a highly desirable portfolio of well located apartments in protected markets across the united states 
approximately of our noi comes from the greater washington  dc metropolitan area  southern california  san francisco bay area  boston  chicago  southeast florida  seattle and the greater new york city metropolitan area 
these are all markets that we believe will perform very well over the long term because of the difficulty of adding new supply  ii we have significant in house high rise development and management capabilities  which we believe will allow us to expand the high rise business into new markets  iii we are organized in a more typical upreit structure  which we believe will enhance our ability to acquire assets using tax deferred acquisition currency  iv the merger of archstone and smith residential brings together what management and the board believes are the two most respected brands in the apartment industry 
the high rise properties are 
table of contents operated under the charles e 
smith residential brand name and all garden communities are operated under the archstone communities brand name  v we have a larger market capitalization and shareholder base which should provide increased liquidity to our shareholders  and vi we have a strong balance sheet that was further enhanced by the addition of million of incremental commitments from four new financial institutions on our unsecured credit facilities  which were received in connection with the closing of the smith merger 
these new commitments increased the borrowing capacity on our credit facilities from million to million  while retaining the same attractive pricing level of libor plus basis points 
results of operations overview basic net earnings attributable to common shares increased approximately million  or  in as compared to this increase is largely attributable to an increase in overall noi due to the acquisition of properties in the smith merger  increased noi due to the acquisition of operating communities and the continued lease up and stabilization of development communities  a million gain on the sale of ces  an unconsolidated entity acquired in the smith merger  and  increased income from ameriton  our real estate joint ventures  as well as unconsolidated entities acquired in the smith merger 
these increases were partially offset by the loss of noi in due to the billion of garden community dispositions in non core markets during including joint venture transactions and million of dispositions in  same store noi decline of in as compared to  higher depreciation  interest and general and administrative expenses due principally to the smith merger  charges of million relating to moisture infiltration and resulting mold issues at one of our high rise properties in southeast florida during the third and fourth quarters of  and a million increase in extraordinary items due to the prepayment of mortgages 
our strongest core markets based on same store revenue growth during included southern california  southeast florida and the greater washington  dc metropolitan area 
the san francisco bay area  seattle and chicago continue to present the greatest challenges for revenue growth 
our basic net earnings attributable to common shares decreased approximately  or  in as compared to this decrease is largely attributable to the loss of garden community noi resulting from the success achieved in advancing our investment strategy through our capital recycling program  by disposing of over billion of garden communities in non core markets during  inclusion of a one time million gain recorded in associated with the exchange of the homestead mortgage notes for common shares and million of interest income on these notes recorded during  write off of investment in service and technology companies totaling million in  and  merger related costs of million in 
table of contents these decreases were partially offset by the inclusion of the results of operations for the last two months of for all properties acquired in the smith merger  which closed on october   a increase in noi in our same store portfolio  driven by same store revenue growth in  an increase in gains on disposition of depreciated real estate in our non core markets  and higher levels of income from unconsolidated entities  including our pro rata share of the results of operations for the last two months of for the unconsolidated entities acquired in the smith merger 
apartment community operations at december   investments in operating apartment communities comprised over of our total real estate portfolio  based on noi

high rise properties were acquired in the smith merger on october  therefore  includes only months of operating results 
additionally  no operating results are included for noi for the entire apartment portfolio  including both garden and high rise divisions  excluding properties reported in discontinued operations  increased by million  or  during as compared to these increases were principally attributable to the inclusion of a full year of noi from high rise properties acquired in the smith merger  the continued successful lease up and stabilization of apartment communities  and  the acquisition of seven apartment communities in these increases were partially offset by the loss of noi due to billion of dispositions in and million of dispositions in  and 
table of contents the decline in same store noi in and corresponding decline in operating margins  which are principally attributable to declining same store revenue  combined with increases in property taxes and insurance 
noi for the entire apartment portfolio  excluding properties reported in discontinued operations  increased by million  or  during as compared to these increases were primarily attributable to the inclusion of approximately million of noi from properties acquired in the smith merger generated during the last two months of  the continued successful lease up and stabilization of development communities  and continued improvements in our property level operating margins  and growth in our same store noi  due primarily to increases in rental revenues from our operating communities and operating efficiencies achieved which contributed to controlled expense growth 
these increases were partially offset by lower overall garden community noi resulting from the success achieved in advancing our investment strategy through our capital recycling program  by disposing of approximately billion of garden communities during the impact of a deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions during the latter half of that negatively affected demand for apartments  and higher property level insurance costs experienced during the last six months of  subsequent to the renewal of our insurance policies on june  the following table reflects revenue  expense and noi growth for same store communities during each respective comparison period same store revenue same store same store growth expense noi growth reduction growth reduction garden high rise total garden high rise total total all garden same store results have been adjusted for items that result in lack of comparability 
includes a full year of results for assets acquired in the smith merger 
based on the consensus of current economic forecasts  which predict a slow recovery in  we anticipate same store noi growth of approximately negative one percent to approximately positive one percent 
we view job growth as one of the most important drivers of demand in our business 
if job growth does not begin to improve throughout  the assumptions mentioned above may prove to be overly optimistic 
conversely  if we experience substantial job growth earlier in the year  our assumptions may be conservative 

table of contents income from unconsolidated entities income from unconsolidated entities increased by million in as compared to primarily as a result of the following factors higher net earnings contributions by ameriton which increased by approximately million in  principally due to gains from the sales of real estate properties  the million increase in net earnings from ces and smc  both acquired in the smith merger  the million gain on sale of ces to a third party in december  and the million increase in our share of the net earnings from real estate joint ventures 
this increase is primarily due to the formation timing of three operating community joint ventures during and three joint ventures acquired in the smith merger 
we expect lower levels of net earnings from our unconsolidated entities in primarily as a result of the sale of ces and smc 
see note in our audited financial statements in this annual report for additional information on income from unconsolidated entities and note for the sale of ces and note for the sale of smc 
income from unconsolidated entities increased by million in as compared to primarily as a result of the following factors our equity in the earnings of ameriton increased from million in to million in including the impact of gains on the sale of real estate properties by ameriton  in connection with the smith merger  we acquired a majority of the economic interest in ces and smc 
our equity in the earnings of these two entities during was million  and our equity in the earnings of the real estate joint ventures  including interest in the three joint ventures acquired in the smith merger  was million during as compared to a loss of  in other income other income decreased by million  or  in as compared to this decrease is principally attributable to lower interest income caused by lower restricted cash balances because of reduced disposition activity  coupled with lower interest rates 
this decrease was partially offset by higher fee income from our joint ventures and ameriton 
the million  or  decrease in other income from to resulted primarily from million of aggregate  one time gains realized in in connection with the sale of the spectrum apartment locator business and the monetization of the homestead mortgage notes receivable  coupled with the recognition of million of interest income on these notes during these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in interest income in depreciation expense the million  or  increase in depreciation expense  excluding properties reported in discontinued operations  in as compared to is due principally to additional depreciation expense associated with properties acquired in the smith merger 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense associated with our significant garden community disposition volume during and the million  or  decrease in depreciation expense  excluding properties reported in discontinued operations  in as compared to is primarily influenced by the higher level of disposition activity in relative to these decreases were partially offset by incremental depreciation expense related to the real estate assets acquired in the smith merger 

table of contents interest expense the million  or  increase in interest expense  excluding interest on properties reported in discontinued operations  in as compared to is the result of the incremental debt assumed in the smith merger  which was partially offset by a lower average cost of variable rate debt 
capitalized interest increased approximately million due to an increase in the number of properties under construction from the addition of properties acquired in the smith merger 
the million  or  decrease in interest expense  excluding interest on properties reported in discontinued operations  from to is primarily attributable to lower average outstanding borrowings  coupled with an overall reduction in interest rates 
the level of capitalized interest decreased approximately million due to the reduction in volume of our development activities 
general and administrative expenses the million  or  increase in general and administrative expenses in as compared to relates primarily to the incremental overhead incurred in connection with the smith merger 
in addition  the amortization of capitalized costs associated with our new revenue management program called lease rent optimizer  which began in december  contributed to the increase in the million  or  increase in general and administrative expenses in as compared to was also due primarily to the smith merger 
provisions for possible loss on investments provisions for loss on investments were million in due to an impairment and related write down to the estimated fair value of a real estate investment held for sale  which is included in net earnings from discontinued apartment communities 
provisions for loss on investments increased million from to this increase is principally attributable to a million write off due to the reduction in the estimated fair value of technology and service related equity investments 
this amount is partially offset by a million decrease in the write downs to the estimated fair value of certain real estate investments held for sale 
other expenses the million  or  increase in other expenses in is principally due to a charge of million relating to moisture infiltration and resulting mold issues at one of our high rise properties in southeast florida during the third and fourth quarters of  partially offset by the decrease in merger related expenses from the million increase in other expenses in is principally attributable to merger related costs approximating million 
this amount is partially offset by the million write off of the net unamortized balance of the conversion factors associated with the homestead mortgages notes in minority interests and preferred share dividends the increase in minority interest in and  as compared to the prior year  is due to the a common units issued by the operating trust in the smith merger 
the million  or  increase in preferred share dividends declared and paid in is primarily attributable to the dividends paid on series h  i  j  k and l preferred shares  which we issued in connection with the smith merger 
this increase was partially offset by the redemption of the series c preferred shares in august and the lower dividends on series a preferred shares resulting from periodic conversions by shareholders into common shares 
preferred share dividends declared decreased by million  or  during as compared to principally as a result of the redemption of series b preferred shares in may and lower dividends on series a preferred shares resulting from periodic conversions by shareholders into common shares 

table of contents discontinued operations in october  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets which became effective on january  for properties accounted for under sfas  the results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations 
the property specific components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include net operating income  depreciation expense  minority interest and interest expense actual interest expense for encumbered properties and a pro rata allocation of interest expense for any unencumbered portion up to our weighted average leverage ratio  as well as the net gain or loss on the eventual disposal of held for sale properties and provisions for possible loss on real estate investments 
we had operating communities classified as held for sale under sfas at december  noi from these properties increased million  or  in due to the inclusion of two communities acquired in the smith merger 
we also sold eight operating communities and one retail property during  resulting in a net gain of million  and recorded a million impairment charge on another operating community 
the results of operations and the gains on the sale of these properties are included in discontinued operations 
additionally  we sold six operating communities during that were either held for sale at december  or sold to our unconsolidated entities and  therefore  are not included in discontinued operations in accordance with sfas net earnings from discontinued operations have been reclassified for all years presented 
gains on dispositions of real estate investments we recognized million  million and million of net gains on the disposition of depreciated real estate assets during excluding properties reported in discontinued operations  and  respectively 
these gains have resulted from our capital redeployment program  which involves the disposition of operating communities in non core markets with less attractive growth prospects to fund investments in our core protected markets 
liquidity and capital resources financial flexibility we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and preserving our financial flexibility  which we believe enhances our ability to capitalize on attractive investment opportunities as they become available 
as a result of the significant cash flow generated by our operations  cash positions at december   and the available capacity under our unsecured credit facilities  we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash flow needs in operating activities our net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by million  or  in as compared to  principally due to an increase in earnings from operations due to the smith merger  which was partially offset by lower same store noi and lost noi resulting from our and disposition activity

during  cash used in financing activities decreased million  or  as compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to the issuance of million in senior unsecured notes during and the million increase in the net proceeds provided by our credit facilities used to finance investing activities 
these increases were partially offset by principal prepayments on mortgages payable  including prepayment penalties  that increased million and dividends and distributions on common shares  preferred shares and minority interests in the amounts of million  million and million  respectively  during as compared to million  million and million  respectively  during during and  we invested an average of million per year primarily in the development of new communities and the acquisition of existing operating communities and realized million per year in proceeds from community dispositions

planned investments following is a summary of unfunded planned investments as of december  dollar amounts in thousands 
the amounts labeled discretionary represent future investments that we plan to make  although there is not a contractual commitment to do so 
the amounts labeled committed represent the approximate amount that we are contractually committed to fund for communities under construction in accordance with construction contracts with general contractors 
planned investments units discretionary committed communities under redevelopment communities under construction communities in planning and owned communities in planning and under control community acquisitions under contract total in addition to the planned investments noted above  we expect to make additional investments relating to planned expenditures on recently acquired communities as well as redevelopment and recurring expenditures to improve and maintain our more established operating communities 
we anticipate completion of most of the communities that are currently under construction and the planned operating community improvements during the remainder of and we expect to start construction on approximately million  based on total expected investment  of communities that are currently in planning in we expect to fund the costs of these development projects over a two to three year period following the date construction commences 
no assurances can be given that communities we do not currently own will be acquired or that planned developments will actually occur 
in addition  actual costs incurred could be greater or less than our current estimates 
funding sources we anticipate financing our planned investment and operating needs primarily with cash flow from operating activities  disposition proceeds from our capital redeployment program and borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities  prior to arranging long term financing 
consistent with our performance in  we anticipate that net cash flow from operating activities during will be sufficient to fund anticipated dividend distribution requirements and debt principal amortization payments 
to fund planned investment activities  we had million in available capacity on our unsecured credit facilities and approximately million of cash on hand at february  in addition  we expect to complete the disposition of million of operating communities during in february  the operating trust issued million in long term unsecured ten year senior notes with an effective interest rate of from its shelf registration statement 
in may  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s to register million in equity securities  which can be issued in the 
table of contents form of common or preferred shares 
in may  the operating trust filed a shelf registration statement on form s to register an additional million for a total of million in unsecured debt securities 
these registration statements were declared effective in june in august  the operating trust issued million in long term unsecured senior five year notes from its shelf registration statement with an effective interest rate of 
in november  the operating trust issued million in long term unsecured five year senior notes with an effective interest rate of from its shelf registration statement 
as of february   archstone smith and the operating trust collectively have million available in shelf registered securities which can be issued based on our ability to effect offerings on satisfactory terms based on prevailing market conditions 
other contingencies and hedging activities for the year ended december   we have accrued and or incurred a liability for approximately million relating to moisture infiltration and resulting mold issues at one of our high rise properties in southeast florida 
of this amount  approximately million represents amounts expensed during the second half of for the estimated cost of repairing or replacing residents property and incurred legal fees of million 
the remaining million represents costs capitalized in accordance with gaap pertaining to remediation and capital improvements to the building 
we are in the process of addressing this issue  and there are still considerable uncertainties that affect our ability to estimate the ultimate cost of remediation efforts 
these uncertainties include the exact nature and extent of the issues  the extent of required remediation efforts and varying costs of alternative strategies for addressing the issues 
the accrual represents management s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs and is based  in part  on estimates obtained from third party environmental contractors and actual costs incurred to date 
it is possible that these estimates could increase or decrease as better information becomes available 
we are also subject to litigation in connection with these issues 
we intend to vigorously contest the claims asserted in the litigation 
due to the preliminary nature of the litigation  it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal actions nor is it reasonably possible to estimate the amount of loss associated with an adverse decision 
expected legal fees related to known litigation should approximate million in we believe these costs are covered by our insurance policies and are pursuing recovery from our carriers 
in addition  we believe there is a basis for other potential recoveries from third parties 
as of december   no estimated recovery has been recorded because we have no basis for making such an estimate at this time 
while moisture infiltration and resulting mold issues have resulted in significant claims at only one of our properties to date  we can make no assurance that liabilities resulting from moisture infiltration and the presence of or exposure to mold will not have a future material impact on our financial results 
we are party to various other claims and routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
we do not believe that the results of any such claims and litigation  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or results of operations 
our involvement with derivative financial instruments is limited  and we do not use them for trading or other speculative purposes 
we occasionally utilize derivative financial instruments to manage the risks associated with our overall borrowing costs 
see note in our audited financial statements in this annual report for additional information on derivative financial instruments currently in use 
critical accounting policies we define critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require our management to exercise their most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
our management has discussed the development and selection of all of these critical accounting policies with our audit committee  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to these policies 
our critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas 
table of contents internal cost capitalization we have an investment organization and infrastructure that supports the due diligence  land acquisition  development and redevelopment of apartment communities 
consistent with gaap  all direct and indirect costs  including interest and real estate taxes  incurred during construction relating to these activities are capitalized 
included in these costs is management s estimate for the portion of internal costs that are incremental and deemed directly or indirectly related to such development activities 
because the estimation of capitalizable internal costs requires management s judgment  we believe internal cost capitalization is a critical accounting estimate 
if future accounting rules limit our ability to capitalize internal costs or if our development activity decreased significantly without a proportionate decrease in internal costs  there could be an increase in our operating expenses 
for example  if we were to hypothetically reduce our development and land acquisition activity by with no corresponding decrease in internal costs  our net earnings per share could decrease by approximately or per share based on amounts 
purchase accounting during october  we merged with smith residential and recorded smith residential s assets and assumed liabilities at their estimated fair values 
due to the magnitude and complexity of the assumptions necessary to apply purchase accounting  management is required to exercise significant judgment  and therefore we view these assumptions as critical accounting estimates 
during  all remaining purchase accounting adjustments were finalized 
adjustments to the initial purchase price allocation were less than one percent of the purchase price 
valuation of real estate long lived assets to be held and used are carried at cost and evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted 
we also evaluate assets for potential impairment when we deem them to be held for sale 
valuation of real estate is considered a critical accounting estimate because the evaluation of impairment and the determination of fair values involve a number of management assumptions relating to future economic events that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value  and therefore  the carrying amounts of our real estate 
when determining if there is an indication of impairment  we estimate the asset s noi over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted cash flow basis and compare this amount to its carrying value 
estimating the expected noi and holding period requires significant management judgment 
if it is determined that there is an indication of impairment for assets to be held and used  or if an asset is deemed to be held for sale  we then determine the asset s fair value 
the apartment industry uses capitalization rates as the primary measure of fair value 
specifically  annual noi for a community is divided by an estimated capitalization rate to determine the fair value of the community 
determining the appropriate capitalization rate requires significant judgment and is typically based on the prevailing rate for the market or submarket 
further  capitalization rates can fluctuate up or down due to a variety of factors in the overall economy or within local markets 
if the actual capitalization rate for a community is significantly different from our estimated rate  the impairment evaluation for an individual asset could be materially affected 
for example  we would value a community with annual noi of million at million using a capitalization rate  whereas that same community would be valued at million if the actual capitalization rate were 
historically we have had limited and infrequent impairment charges  and the majority of our apartment community sales have produced gains 
for example  we have sold billion of real estate assets over the last seven years  which produced million in gains at an unleveraged internal rate of return of approximately 
we evaluate a real estate asset for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 

table of contents capital expenditures and depreciable lives we incur costs relating to redevelopment initiatives  revenue enhancing and expense reducing capital expenditures  and recurring capital expenditures that are capitalized as part of our real estate 
these amounts are capitalized and depreciated over estimated useful lives determined by management 
determining whether expenditures meet the criteria for capitalization and the assignment of depreciable lives requires our management to exercise significant judgment and is therefore considered a significant accounting estimate 
total capital expenditures were and of weighted average gross real estate as of december  and  respectively 
the growth in capital expenditures was principally due to significant redevelopment efforts in our high rise portfolio acquired in the smith merger 
additionally  depreciation expense as a percentage of weighted average depreciable real estate was  and or   and  per unit for the years ended december   and  respectively 
if the actual weighted average useful life were determined to be one year shorter or longer than management s current estimate  our annual depreciation expense would increase or decrease approximately or per share 
see note in our audited financial statements in this annual report for additional detail on depreciable lives 
moisture infiltration and mold remediation costs accounting for correction of moisture infiltration and mold remediation costs is considered a critical accounting estimate because significant judgment is required by management to determine when to record a liability  how much should be accrued as a liability and whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization 
we estimate and accrue costs related to correcting the moisture infiltration and remediating resulting mold when we anticipate incurring costs because of the threat of litigation or the assertion of a legal claim 
when we incur costs at our own discretion  the cost is recognized as incurred 
moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation costs are only capitalized when it is determined by management that such remediation costs also extend the life  increase the capacity  or improve the safety or efficiency of the property relative to when the community was originally constructed or acquired  if later 
all other related costs are expensed 
for the year ended december   we have incurred and or accrued a liability for approximately million of which we expensed million  including incurred legal fees of million  and capitalized million 
there are considerable uncertainties that affect our ability to estimate the ultimate cost of correction and remediation efforts 
these uncertainties include  but are not limited to  assessing the exact nature and extent of the issues  the extent of required remediation efforts and the varying costs of alternative strategies for addressing the issues 
the accrual represents management s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs and is based  in part  on estimates obtained from third party environmental contractors and actual costs incurred to date 
it is possible that these estimates could increase or decrease as better information becomes available 
further  due to the preliminary nature of the litigation  it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal actions nor is it reasonably possible to estimate the amount of loss associated with an adverse decision 
therefore  we have not accrued a liability for litigation settlement costs 
our eventual costs to correct moisture infiltration and remediate resulting mold could be significantly different than current estimates 
for example  if our total costs were more or less than our current estimates  and the ratio between the expensed and capitalized portion remained constant  our net earnings per share would increase or decrease by approximately per share

new accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
we are required to adopt sfas on january  sfas significantly limits the treatment of losses associated with early extinguishment of debt as an extraordinary item 
sfas also impacts certain sale leaseback transactions 
upon adoption  early extinguishments will not continue to qualify for extraordinary item treatment and we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position  net earnings or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued sfas accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we are required to adopt sfas on january  sfas requires that certain expenses associated with restructuring charges be accrued as liabilities in the period in which the liability is incurred

in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company has not yet determined the impact of the interpretation 
the disclosure requirements are effective immediately 
in december  the fasb issued sfas accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
we are required to adopt sfas for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  we have modified the disclosure of our transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation in this annual report to reflect the additional requirements of this statement 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position  net earnings or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
we are required to adopt the interpretation for financial statements for the fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  this interpretation clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  and requires that we consolidate the results of variable interest entities in which we have a majority variable interest 
although we have not yet determined the total impact of adopting the interpretation  it is reasonably possible that we will be deemed the primary beneficiary of ameriton  which would result in consolidation of this currently unconsolidated entity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk stock investments we have both public and private investments in equity securities 
the publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale securities and carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the private investments  for which we lack the ability to exercise significant influence  are accounted for at cost 
declines in the value of public and private investments that our management determines are other than temporary  are recorded as a provision for possible loss on investments 
our evaluation of the carrying value of these investments is primarily based upon a regular review of market valuations if available  each company s operating performance and assumptions underlying cash flow forecasts 
in addition  our management considers events and circumstances that may signal the impairment of an investment 
during  we concluded that our investments in private service and technology companies were impaired due to the financial position of the investees 
since the decline was deemed to be other than temporary  we recorded a million provision for possible loss on investments during use of derivatives in hedging activities we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and will occasionally utilize interest rate swaps and interest rate caps as hedges with the objective of lowering our overall borrowing costs 
we do not use these derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes 
further  as a matter of policy  we only enter into contracts with major financial institutions with strong investment grade credit ratings 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  we have not nor do we expect to sustain a material loss from the use of these hedging instruments 
to determine the fair values of derivative and other financial instruments  we use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date 
these 
table of contents methods and assumptions include standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing models  replacement cost and termination cost 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and therefore  are not necessarily indicative of the actual amounts that we could realize upon disposition 
the following table summarizes the notional amount  carrying and estimated fair value of our derivative financial instruments  as of december  dollar amounts in thousands 
the notional amount represents the aggregate amount of a particular security that is currently hedged at that time  but does not represent exposure to credit  interest rate or market risks

moreover  because there were no firm commitments to actually sell these instruments at fair value as of december   the information presented herein is an estimate and has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss  if any  will depend on the exposures that arise during future periods  hedging strategies  prevailing interest
