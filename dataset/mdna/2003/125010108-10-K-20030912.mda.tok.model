item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  and market network distribution and transmission products and provide services and operational support systems to operators of advanced hybrid fiber coax broadband networks 
we operate in three industry segments broadband communications products  broadband network services  and broadband management solutions 
our broadband communications products division is responsible for research  development  management  production  support  and sales of advanced fiber optic and radio frequency equipment 
our broadband network services division provides outsourced technical services  including network engineering and design  construction  activation  optimization  certification  maintenance  and operations 
our broadband management solutions division is responsible for the development  integration  management  implementation  support and sales of operational support systems that focus on network services management and mobile workforce management solutions 
business combination on september   we acquired certain assets and liabilities of pbn from royal philips electronics 
pbn is a provider of broadband products  including transmission products  network optimizing technologies  and element management systems 
pbn is supported by sales and services organizations worldwide  with a strong customer base in europe and the asia pacific region 
the purchase included assets in various countries  cable infrastructure products  and a design and production facility in manlius  new york 
these assets and the facility became part of our broadband communications products division 
the purchase price for the acquisition was approximately million euros  which was subject to certain adjustments 
the effective date of the acquisition was august  pbn s fiscal month end 
accordingly  the results of operations of pbn are included in the consolidated financial statements for the period from august  through june  at closing on september   the company made an initial cash payment of million euros million us dollars  which was net of  of imputed interest to royal philips electronics  with subsequent payments subject to certain adjustments 
as final consideration of the purchase price  a cash payment of  euros  us dollars at june  will be paid by december  in addition  the company incurred direct transaction costs of approximately million to consummate the transaction 
the company used its available cash to fund the acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and resulted in goodwill of million 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment and non recurring charges fiscal year plant closings 
during the quarter ended december   we announced the closing of our manlius  new york manufacturing facility and our louviers  france engineering and support services facility 
the decision to close the manlius manufacturing facility was a result of the process we began  as of the pbn acquisition date  to address redundancy in the product lines and manufacturing capacity resulting from the acquisition of pbn 
we ceased manufacturing and operations at these facilities as of june  as of june   fair value adjustments for property  plant and equipment of  and exit costs of million  which include employee severance and termination benefits  relocation for employees offered employment transfers  and lease commitment costs  were accounted for as an adjustment to the allocation of the original purchase price  and recorded as additional goodwill see notes b and c to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charges 
we continued to implement various initiatives during fiscal year to improve our operating performance  and align our cost structure with current business levels 
as a result  we recorded additional restructuring charges of  during fiscal year these were partially offset by a reversal of  for previously recorded restructuring charges incurred in prior fiscal years 
the result was a net charge in fiscal year of  goodwill impairment charge 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 
the company adopted the provisions of statement effective june  as of the date of adoption  the company determined it did not have an impairment of goodwill 
we are required to reevaluate whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis 
we have selected the end of our third fiscal quarter of each year to reassess the value of our reporting units and related goodwill balances  or at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
accordingly  we reassessed whether goodwill was impaired as of march  for purposes of applying statement  we believe our operating segments broadband communications products  broadband network services  and broadband management solutions represent the company s reporting units  although there was no goodwill or intangible assets associated with broadband management solutions as of the date of adoption or as of march  we determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the related assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
the company then determined the fair value of each reporting unit  based on an independent third party appraisal  using a discounted cash flow model 
the company determined that the carrying value of the broadband communications products reporting unit exceeded its fair value  indicating that an impairment existed 
the amount of the impairment loss was determined by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
consequently  an impairment charge of million was recorded during the fiscal quarter ended march  the decline in the fair value of the broadband communications products reporting unit was largely attributable to the weakness in capital spending by cable operators 
an estimate was made of the value of other intangible assets not recorded on our balance sheet as of march   in order to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to both tangible and intangible assets as of march  based on a third party valuation of these unrecorded intangible assets completed during the fourth quarter ending june   we recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of million in our fourth quarter operating results  resulting in a total goodwill impairment charge for the fiscal year ended june  of million 
as of june   the remaining goodwill associated with broadband communications products and broadband network services was million and million  respectively see note g to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year plant closing 
on february   we announced the closing of our buenos aires  argentina  manufacturing facility 
this action completed the final step of the integration of assets purchased from adc telecommunications inc adc in august the decision to close the argentina manufacturing facility was a result of the process we began  as of the acquisition date  to address redundancy in the product lines and manufacturing capacity resulting from the acquisition 
we substantially ceased manufacturing operations at this facility as of march fair value adjustments for inventory and fixed assets of million and exit costs of million were accounted for as an adjustment to the original purchase price and were recorded as additional goodwill 
in addition  we realized a translation loss of  related to the devaluation of the argentine peso in the fourth quarter of fiscal year restructuring charges 
we implemented various initiatives during fiscal year to consolidate our manufacturing operations  improve our operating performance  and align our cost structure with current business levels 
as a result  we recorded restructuring charges of million 
these were partially offset by a reversal of  for previously recorded restructuring charges incurred in fiscal year  related to consolidation efforts at our pennsylvania and georgia facilities 
the result was a net charge in fiscal year of million 
our restructuring costs primarily related to involuntary workforce reduction costs of million for approximately employees  fixed asset write downs of  and cancellation costs associated with fixed contractual obligations of impairment charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded an impairment charge of million for goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisition of mobileforce in fiscal year the impairment was based on a write down of these assets to their estimated fair value  based upon the projected recoverability of these intangible assets through an analysis of expected future cash flows 
in accordance with our ordinary business practices  projected future cash flows were discounted at a rate corresponding to our estimated cost of capital 
non recurring charges 
on june   adelphia communications adelphia  a major customer  filed a petition for protection under the federal bankruptcy statutes 
as of june   the company had outstanding accounts receivable of million related to adelphia and affiliated companies 
a charge off to bad debts of million was recorded as of june   due to management s assessment that these accounts receivable were likely not recoverable 
this charge was included in selling and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable period 
management bases its estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
the critical accounting policies requiring estimates  assumptions  and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts valuation of inventories valuation of goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets restructuring costs warranty liabilities accounting for foreign currency translation and transactions accounting for income taxes different assumptions and judgments would change estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  which  in turn  could change the results from those reported 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our revenues derive principally from equipment sales  which are generally recognized when the equipment has been shipped 
service revenues  consisting of system design  field services  and other consulting engagements  are generally recognized as services are rendered in accordance with the terms of contracts 
for our software licensing arrangements involving multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair values of the elements 
license revenue allocated to software products  under certain terms and conditions  is recognized upon the delivery of the software products 
for certain of our software license arrangements where professional services are being provided that are deemed to be essential to the functionality or are for significant production  modification  or customization of the software product  both the software product revenue and the professional service revenue are recognized on the completed contract method as the arrangements represent our initial installations  and the company does not currently have the ability to reasonably estimate contract costs at the inception of the contracts 
under the completed contract method  revenue is recognized when the contract is complete  and all direct costs and related revenues are deferred until that time 
the entire amount of an estimated loss on a contract is accrued at the time a loss on a contract is projected 
revenue recognition in each period is dependent on the application of these accounting policies 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we establish a general allowance for doubtful accounts based on percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and historical payment experience 
in addition  we establish allowances to charge off specifically identified doubtful accounts for the amount deemed worthless when a loss is deemed to be both probable and estimable 
in the event that we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers  resulting in an unexpected problem with collectibility of receivables and our actual bad debts differ from estimates  or we adjust estimates in future periods  our established allowances may be insufficient and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if we provided more allowances than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on our actual collection experience 
in the event we adjust our allowance estimates  it could materially affect our operating results and financial position 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method 
we establish provisions for excess and obsolete inventories after evaluation of historical sales and usage  current economic trends  market conditions  product rationalization  forecasted sales  product lifecycles  and current inventory levels 
this evaluation requires us to make estimates regarding future events in an industry where rapid technological changes are prevalent 
we experienced significant changes in required reserves during fiscal year  due primarily to a decline in market conditions and product rationalization resulting from the pbn and adc acquisitions 
it is possible that increases in inventory reserves may be required in the future if there is a further decline in market conditions or if changes in expected product lifecycles occur 
alternatively  if market conditions improve or product lifecycles extend  we may have greater success in selling inventory that had previously been written down 
in either event  the value of our inventory may be under or overstated and recognition of such under or overstatement will affect our cost of sales in a future period  which could materially affect our operating results and financial position 
valuation of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we assess goodwill at least annually for impairment and more frequently if circumstances warrant 
we have chosen the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year as the period for performing our annual assessment 
the impairment assessment is performed in two steps i we determine impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying value and ii if there is an indication of impairment  we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
we normally calculate the fair value of our reporting units by using the projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate we determine to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business 
if impairment is indicated  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to the reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities 
the residual value is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the difference between the carrying amount of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 
we assess other intangible assets and other long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
when impairment is determined  it is recorded as a charge against earnings in the period when recognized 
for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets  refer to note g of our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring costs 
for restructuring activities initiated prior to december   we recorded restructuring costs in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
restructuring costs were recorded when the company committed to an exit plan and significant changes to the exit plan were not likely 
we estimated the future amounts to be incurred as a result of exit plans and recorded the amounts as a charge against earnings 
for restructuring activities initiated after december   restructuring costs are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
for additional information regarding restructuring costs  refer to note c of our consolidated financial statements 
revisions to our estimates could result in an additional charge to earnings or a reversal of previously recorded charges  which could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions change 
warranty liabilities 
we warranty our products against defects in materials and workmanship  generally for two to five years  depending upon product lines and geographic regions 
a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities is recorded when the product is shipped  based upon our historical experience of known product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures 
in addition  from time to time  the recorded amount is adjusted for specifically identified warranty exposures if unforeseen technical problems arise 
in the event that our historical experience of product failure rates and costs of correcting product failures change  or our estimates relating to probable losses resulting from specifically identified warranty exposures change  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
in the event we change our warranty reserve estimates  a charge against future cost of sales or a reversal of previously recorded charges may materially affect our operating results and financial position 
accounting for foreign currency translation and transactions 
we convert the assets and liabilities of foreign operations into their us dollar equivalents at rates in effect at the balance sheet dates  and record translation adjustments in shareholders equity 
the statements of operations of foreign operations are translated from the operation s functional currency to us dollar equivalents at average rates for the period 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from settlement of foreign receivables and payables  including certain cross currency intercompany activities where payment is expected to be satisfied in the normal course of business  are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
other cross currency intercompany activities  where management has no intent to require payment in the foreseeable future  are recorded in shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
in the event management s intent with respect to cross currency intercompany activities changes  it could result in a foreign currency gain or loss that may materially affect our operating results and financial position 
accounting for income taxes 
we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current income tax payable and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
deferred taxes arise due to temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities and from net operating losses and credit carryforwards 
in general  deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in the company s statement of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 
accordingly  realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions  losses and credits can be utilized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers historical operating losses  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
as a result of the cumulative losses over the past three years  we concluded during fiscal year that a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets was necessary 
as of june   a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets has been recorded  with the exception of certain net deferred tax assets in specific foreign jurisdictions where we believe it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will be realized 
in addition  we expect to provide a valuation allowance on any future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize these assets 
results of operations the company s consolidated statements of operations from continuing operations for fiscal years  and as a percentage of net sales  are as follows year ended june  june  june  net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses selling and administrative research and product development amortization of goodwill and other intangibles goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges acquired in process technology charge merger and restructuring costs total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit loss from continuing operations the table below sets forth our net sales for fiscal years   and for each of our reportable segments described in note t of our consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year ended june  june  june  operating segment net sales net sales net sales broadband communications products broadband network services broadband management solutions total fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales decreased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year broadband communications products segment sales decreased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease in net sales was largely attributable to reduced or deferred capital spending by customers in the cable industry for network build outs and expansion of existing networks 
the company believes the reduced capital spending levels are the result of financial difficulties of certain cable customers  challenges in gaining access to capital markets  and a focus by cable operators on reducing debt and increasing cash flow 
the decline in sales affected our optical product lines and  to a lesser extent  our radio frequency product lines 
optical product sales declined  to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year sales of radio frequency amplifiers decreased  to in fiscal year from million in fiscal year although the company has broadened its customer base and increased its base of installed equipment  broadband communications products sales are dependent on the capital spending levels of its customers 
broadband network services segment sales decreased by to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the decrease during fiscal year also resulted from reduced spending by domestic cable operators on technical services  primarily related to our outside plant operations  which include system sweep  reverse path activation  ingress mitigation  node certification  and system maintenance 
broadband management solutions segment sales increased by to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year we increased system deployments for both our network service manager nsm and mobile workforce manager mwm software products 
we believe these software products  which provide tools to network operators for proactively managing services being delivered and monitoring the status of their networks  have begun to gain acceptance 
domestic sales decreased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease resulted from reductions in both broadband communications products segment and broadband network services segment sales due to reduced spending by certain domestic multiple system operators msos 
total domestic sales were of consolidated net sales for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year international sales increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase for fiscal year resulted from higher broadband communications products segment sales  primarily in europe and asia 
as a result of our acquisition of the pbn assets and operations  we have increased our customer base and installed equipment base in the markets of europe and asia 
we have added operations in the netherlands  spain  portugal  united kingdom  france  germany  singapore  australia and china 
these operations include engineering  sales and administrative support activities to support the delivery of localized versions of products and services to customers in europe and asia 
we expect the demand for our products in international markets will continue to be highly variable 
the international markets represent distinct markets in which capital spending decisions for hybrid fiber coax network distribution equipment can be affected by a variety of factors  including access to financing and general economic conditions 
our total international sales were of consolidated net sales for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year gross margin 
gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year for the broadband communications products segment  gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the decrease in broadband communications products segment gross margin for fiscal year was due primarily to lower volumes and an increase in our provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
the increase in the excess and obsolete inventory provision was the result of significant reductions in demand levels  product line rationalization decisions for overlapping product lines resulting from acquisitions  transition to an outsourced manufacturer of product lines determined to be at the end of their product lifecycle  and a refinement of the company s reserve estimation process to quantify reserve requirements for inventory levels in excess of our forecasted demand 
in addition  lower volumes resulted in higher manufacturing costs per unit due to allocating higher fixed factory overhead costs which contributed to lower gross margins during the year 
for the broadband network services segment  gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the decrease in broadband network services segment gross margin was due primarily to reduced volume levels without a corresponding level of reduction in fixed overhead costs and services mix 
broadband management solutions segment gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year broadband management solutions segment gross margin increased as a result of increased deployments of nsm and mwm software solutions  whereby the operation began absorbing certain fixed personnel and other costs 
we anticipate that our future gross margin will continue to be affected by many factors  including sales volumes  sales mix  competitive pricing  and the timing of new product introductions 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million of net sales in fiscal year included in selling and administrative expense for fiscal year was bad debt expense of million  which included million for a specific charge off of accounts receivables from adelphia communications and affiliates  and million related to customers in latin america  where economic conditions affected the collection of certain outstanding accounts receivable 
in addition  costs of million associated with the implementation of a fully integrated erp system were incurred during fiscal year excluding the aforementioned costs relating to fiscal year  the company increased selling and administrative expenses during fiscal year for personnel costs and administrative expenses related to our acquisition of pbn assets and operations  which were partially offset by recovery of million on certain accounts previously deemed uncollectible 
research and product development 
research and product development expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million of net sales in fiscal year research and product development expenses in the broadband communications products segment were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs resulting from our acquisition of pbn assets and operations 
research and product development expenses in the broadband management solutions segment were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower personnel costs resulting from reductions in the workforce and lower expenses for the development of mwm software solutions 
other research and product development expenses  not charged to segments  were  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower personnel and other costs associated with technology investigation and oversight functions 
we anticipate continuing investments in research and product development expenses in future periods related to ongoing initiatives in the development of optical products and network services management and mobile workforce software capabilities 
operating loss by segment 
operating loss excluding unallocated items for the broadband communications products segment in fiscal year was million  compared to a loss of million in fiscal year included in the operating loss for fiscal year was a charge of million for a specific charge off of accounts receivable from adelphia communications and affiliates  and million related to customers in latin america 
excluding these charges from the prior year  the change in our operating results from year to year would have been increased losses as a result of lower sales volumes  lower gross margins  and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory during fiscal year operating loss excluding unallocated items for the broadband network services segment in fiscal year was  compared to a loss of million in fiscal year the decline in operating loss for fiscal year was primarily a result of a charge to bad debt expense of million related to adelphia in fiscal year excluding this charge  the operating loss would have increased as a result of lower sales volumes and lower gross margins during fiscal year operating loss excluding unallocated items for the broadband management solutions segment in fiscal year was million  compared to a loss of million in fiscal year included in the operating loss for fiscal year was million in amortization of intangibles related to our acquisition of mobileforce 
based upon the projected recoverability of these intangible assets  an impairment charge for the remaining carrying value of these assets was recorded as of june   but not allocated to the broadband management solutions segment 
excluding the aforementioned amortization  the reduction in operating loss for fiscal year derives primarily from increased volume during the fiscal year  as a result of increased deployments  and an improved cost structure 
interest and investment income 
interest expense was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the increase in interest expense in fiscal year resulted primarily from an imputed interest charge of  related to the pbn acquisition 
investment income was  in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in investment income resulted from reduced investment balances  compared to fiscal year and lower interest rates 
operating cash and short term investments were used to fund the pbn acquisition and operating losses during fiscal year foreign exchange gain loss 
foreign exchange loss was  in fiscal year  compared to a gain of million in fiscal year the foreign currency exchange loss for fiscal year includes a million loss related to the settlement of a foreign exchange forward contract 
in fiscal year  we recorded a gain of million related to this foreign exchange forward contract 
other income expense  net 
other income  net was  in fiscal year  compared to other expense  net of million in fiscal year other income  net for fiscal year included  as a partial recovery on a note receivable from a third party that had been fully reserved for by the company in fiscal year income taxes 
income tax expense was million for fiscal year  compared with an income tax benefit for fiscal year of million 
during fiscal year  the company assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets  giving consideration to historical operating losses  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
as a result of the cumulative losses over the past three years  we determined that realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences  net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards was uncertain as of june  therefore  the company recorded an additional valuation allowance of million for the full amount of its net deferred tax assets  with the exception of certain net deferred tax assets in specific foreign jurisdictions 
we expect to record valuation allowances related to net tax benefits arising from temporary differences and operating losses in future periods until a level of profitability is sustained that demonstrates it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize all or part of the tax benefits of the deferred tax assets 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year broadband communications products segment sales increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year demand increased from both domestic and international cable operators compared to the prior year when broadband communications products sales declined as a result of a sharp slowdown of capital spending in the telecommunications industry 
spending for network system upgrades during the year was driven by requirements for higher bandwidth products to support new two way services 
contributing to the sales growth were incremental sales resulting from our acquisition of certain assets of adc  primarily for optical product lines 
optical product sales were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year sales of radio frequency amplifiers decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year broadband network services segment sales remained relatively flat at million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year sales were primarily attributable to technical services performed in our customers plants 
broadband management solutions segment sales also remained relatively flat at million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year sales were primarily attributable to mobile workforce software licenses and professional services 
domestic sales increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from an increase in broadband communications products segment sales  due to the increased capital spending by certain domestic msos 
included in the domestic sales for fiscal year  were million of sales to adelphia 
on june   adelphia filed a petition for protection under the federal bankruptcy statutes 
total domestic sales were of consolidated net sales for both fiscal years and international sales increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase resulted from an increase in broadband communications products segment sales in europe  asia  and latin america during the year 
as a result of our acquisition of certain assets and operations of adc  we benefited from expansion of our customer base in europe and added an operation in klagenfurt  austria 
our total international sales were of consolidated net sales for both fiscal years and gross margin 
gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year for the broadband communications products segment  gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the improvement in broadband communications products segment gross margin was due primarily to product mix  which included higher sales of optical products which typically carry higher gross margins than radio frequency products  and improvements in our cost structure as a result of manufacturing consolidation efforts which began in the last half of fiscal year for the broadband network services segment  gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the decrease in broadband network services segment gross margin was due primarily to services mix 
broadband management solutions segment gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year broadband management solutions segment gross margin was impacted negatively by increased costs associated with employees that support the deployment of network services management and mobile workforce management solutions  which were included in cost of sales 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million of net sales in fiscal year included in selling and administrative expense for fiscal year was bad debt expense of million  which includes million for a specific charge off of accounts receivable from adelphia communications and affiliates  and million related to customers in latin america 
selling and administrative expenses also increased during fiscal year due to personnel costs and administrative expenses related to our acquisitions of mobileforce technologies inc mobileforce in april  and certain operations of adc in august in addition  costs associated with the implementation of a fully integrated erp system were incurred during fiscal year costs of million related to business process reengineering activities and training associated with this project were expensed as incurred in fiscal year research and product development 
research and product development expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million of net sales in fiscal year research and product development expenses in the broadband communications products segment were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs resulting from inclusion of certain operations of adc and additional expenses for the development of optical products 
research and product development expenses in the broadband management solutions segment were million in fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs resulting from our acquisition of mobileforce in april and additional expenses for the development of mobile workforce management software solutions 
other research and product development expenses  not charged to segments  were  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher personnel and other costs associated with technology investigation and oversight functions 
operating income loss by segment 
operating loss excluding unallocated items for the broadband communications products segment in fiscal year was million  compared to operating income of million in fiscal year the decrease in operating income for fiscal year was primarily attributable to bad debt expense of million related to adelphia and latin american customers during the year 
operating loss excluding unallocated items for the broadband network services segment in fiscal year was million  compared to operating income of million in fiscal year the operating loss for fiscal year derived primarily from a charge to bad debt expense of million related to adelphia 
operating loss excluding unallocated items for the broadband management solutions segment in fiscal year was million  compared to a loss of million in fiscal year the increased operating loss for fiscal year derives primarily from investment and development costs associated with our network services management products  as well as operating costs  including amortization of acquired intangible assets related to our mobileforce acquisition in april interest and investment income 
interest expense was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the increase in interest expense in fiscal year resulted primarily from interest on certain long term obligations 
investment income was million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in investment income resulted from reduced investment balances compared to fiscal year and lower interest rates 
foreign exchange gain 
foreign exchange gain was million in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the increase in foreign exchange gain in fiscal year included million for a gain related to the fair value of a foreign exchange forward contract  and  for other net foreign currency transaction gains during the period 
other expense  net 
other expense  net was million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year other expense  net for fiscal year included a provision for impairment of a note receivable of million from a third party 
in fiscal year  other expense  net primarily was comprised of a million write off of a long term investment 
income taxes 
our overall effective income tax rate was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year the effective income tax rate for fiscal year reflects the impact of us federal  foreign and state income taxes and changes in the valuation allowance for deferred taxes 
the lower effective income tax rate for fiscal year resulted primarily from an increase in the valuation allowance of million related to the tax benefits of losses in foreign jurisdictions and for state income tax purposes that may not be realized 
in addition  fluctuations in the effective income tax rate from period to period reflect changes in permanent differences  non deductible amounts  the relative profitability related to us versus us operations and the differences in statutory tax rates by jurisdiction 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  down from million at june  in addition  the company has an arrangement with a bank at june  whereby a cash compensating balance of million is being maintained to secure certain letters of credit issued on behalf of the company 
the total cash compensating balance was classified as a current asset at june   as the terms for the letters of credit expire in less than one year 
working capital was million at june  as compared with million as of june  the reduction in working capital was primarily attributable to our acquisition of pbn  establishment of a valuation allowance related to net deferred tax assets  increases in excess and obsolete inventory provisions  and funding the loss from operations during fiscal year net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal year  compared with million in fiscal year the net loss for fiscal year included a number of non cash charges such as the million intangible asset impairment charge  a million change in deferred tax assets related to recording a valuation allowance  and a million increase in inventory reserves 
accounts and notes receivable decreased by million in fiscal year compared to a decrease of million in the prior year  reflecting declining sales volumes during the current year 
offsetting these changes were cash used of million for reductions in accounts payables and million related to reductions in accrued liabilities  reflecting payments against incentive  restructuring and other accruals from the prior year 
all of the foregoing amounts are net of the effect of acquisitions 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the increase in cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year was due primarily to utilizing million of cash for the acquisition of pbn assets and operations  and million for the payment of an earnout provision associated with our aerotec communications  inc acquisition

these uses were offset partially by proceeds of million from the sale of marketable securities  other short term investments and property  plant and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal year  compared with cash provided by financing activities of million for the same period of the prior year 
the current year activity primarily represented payments on long term debt  which were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock to our employee stock purchase plan and from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
the major element of the change in cash provided by financing activities for the same period of the prior year was net proceeds of million received from our follow on public offering of stock on february  and million from the exercise of stock options and warrants  which were partially offset by million used for the purchase of treasury stock 
the company has a two year secured revolving credit financing agreement with a commercial lender 
borrowings under the financing agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes  and provides a commitment of up to an aggregate amount of million 
the financing agreement allows for issuance of letters of credit and cash borrowings 
letters of credit outstanding are limited to no more than million 
cash borrowings are limited by certain availability reserves and a borrowing base  primarily a percentage of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables  up to the facility s maximum availability less letters of credit outstanding 
as security for the financing agreement  the company has pledged the following collateral trade accounts receivable  inventory  general intangibles  real estate  equipment  life insurance policies  and certain stock of a wholly owned foreign subsidiary 
the financing agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants  including covenants limiting incurrence of subordinated debt  disposal of collateral  and the payment of dividends except stock dividends 
the financing agreement contains no financial covenants 
the financing agreement is committed through november  borrowings under the financing agreement bear interest at an applicable bank rate or libor plus two and three quarters percent per annum  payable monthly 
the financing agreement required the payment of a facility fee of  at execution  a fee on the unused commitment of per annum payable monthly  and an administrative fee of  per annum 
as of june   the company had no borrowings outstanding on the financing agreement 
based upon the eligible borrowing base at june   available borrowings under the financing agreement were million 
as a condition for closing on the financing agreement  the company terminated its prior credit agreement with a bank  whereby million was available as a revolving line of credit  subject to an aggregate sub limit of million for issuance of letters of credit 
as of june   we continued to maintain letters of credit with the bank in the aggregate of million related to our workers compensation program  customer obligations  and equipment lease obligations 
we are required to maintain cash deposits of million as collateral for these letters of credit 
under the current financing agreement  a letter of credit has been issued for  related to increased requirements under our workers compensation policy 
information regarding our contractual obligations are as follows expected cash payments by fiscal year and beyond in thousands contractual obligations long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations information regarding our commitments are as follows amount of commitments expiration by fiscal year and beyond in thousands other commitments standby letters of credit total commitments our main source of liquidity is our unrestricted cash on hand 
we will continue to use cash to fund our restructuring accrual and additional consideration required for the acquisition of certain operations of pbn 
we believe that restructuring initiatives completed in fiscal year  including the closing of our manlius  new york manufacturing facility and our louviers  france operation  will produce cash savings in fiscal year we intend to continue our initiatives to achieve more cost effective operations throughout fiscal year although no specific restructuring actions are planned at the present time  if a further decline in spending occurs in the cable industry  we may undertake additional restructuring initiatives and incur expenses in amounts that have not yet been determined 
in addition  we have filed unsecured claims in the bankruptcy cases of adelphia communications and affiliates  related to our accounts receivable which were previously written off in fiscal year a subsequent recovery or partial recovery of these accounts receivable could result in a potential future source of cash and positive impact on our results of operations 
we believe that current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balances  as well as our new financing agreement  will be adequate to cover our operating cash requirements  planned capital expenditures  remaining restructuring costs and the additional consideration for the acquisition of certain operations of pbn over the next months 
however  we may find it necessary or desirable to seek other sources of financing to support our capital needs and provide available funds for working capital  or financing strategic initiatives  including acquiring or investing in complementary businesses  products  services  or technologies 
given the current status of the communications industry and its impact on our near term financial results and the restrictions in the financing agreement  we believe there are limited alternatives available as sources of additional financing 
accordingly  any plan to raise additional capital would likely involve equity based financing  such as the issuance of common stock  preferred stock  or subordinated convertible debt securities and warrants  which would be dilutive to existing shareholders
