item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we operate outpatient physical and occupational therapy clinics that provide pre and post operative care and treatment for a variety of orthopedic related disorders and sports related injuries 
at december   we operated outpatient physical and occupational therapy clinics in states 
the average age of our clinics at december   was years 
we have developed of the clinics and acquired six 
to date  we have sold one clinic  closed facilities due to substandard clinic performance  and consolidated three clinics with other existing clinics 
we added new clinics in and plan to open between and clinics in in addition to our owned clinics  we also manage physical therapy facilities for third parties  primarily physicians  with five third party facilities under management as of december  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position involving significant estimates requiring our judgment 
our critical accounting policies are revenue recognition 
we primarily bill third party payors for services at standard rates 
net patient revenues are based on established billing rates  less allowances and discounts for patients covered by contractual programs 
payments received under these programs are based on predetermined rates and are generally less than the established billing rates of the clinics 
net patient revenues reflect reserves  evaluated monthly by management  for contractual and other adjustments agreed to or established with payors 
reimbursement for medicare beneficiaries is based upon a fee schedule published by hhs 
see our business sources of revenue in item allowance for doubtful accounts 
we review the accounts receivable aging and rely on prior experiences with particular payors at each clinic to determine an appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts 
historically  clinics that have large numbers of aged accounts generally have less favorable collection experience  and thus they require a higher allowance 
accounts that are ultimately determined to be uncollectible are written off against our bad debt allowance 
the amount of our aggregate bad debt allowance is periodically reviewed for adequacy in light of current and historical experience 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we must estimate our federal and state income tax liability  as well as assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as bad debt expense and amortization of leasehold improvements for tax and for accounting purposes 
the differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and if not  establish a valuation allowance 
carrying value of long lived assets 
our property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill collectively  our long lived assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets at december  and we account for our long lived assets pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
these accounting standards require that we periodically  and upon the occurrence of certain events  assess the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if the carrying value of our property and equipment or intangible assets exceeds their undiscounted cash flows  we are required to write the carrying value down to estimated fair value 
also  if the carrying value of our goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value  we are required to allocate the estimated fair value to our assets and liabilities  as if we had just acquired it in a business combination 
we then would write down the carrying value of our goodwill to the implied fair value 
any such write down is included as an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
a degree of judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our long lived assets 
we may use quoted market prices  prices for similar assets  present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates 
in addition  we may obtain independent appraisals in certain circumstances 
we may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques 
accordingly  any value ultimately derived from our long lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value 
accounting for minority interests 
in the majority of our partnership agreements  the therapist partner begins with a profit interest in his or her clinic partnership  which increases by at the end of each year until his or her interest reaches 
within the balance sheet and statement of operations we record partner therapist s profit interest in the clinic partnerships as minority interest in earnings of subsidiary limited partnerships 
the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  issues related to the accounting for stock compensation under apb no 
and fasb interpretation no   which provides specific accounting guidance relating to various incentive compensation issues 
we have reviewed eitf with respect to the partnerships structure and the accounting for minority interest and concluded that for partnerships formed after january   eitf requires us to expense as compensation rather than as a minority interest in earnings  the clinic partner s interest in profits 
moreover  eitf will also require  as to clinic partnerships formed after january   that we expense as compensation rather than capitalizing as goodwill  the purchase of minority interest in the partnerships 
at this time we operate wholly owned clinics without any minority interest 
it is possible that due to this recent change in accounting practices we will increase our development of non partnership clinics  and because of the revised method of accounting for clinic partnerships  we probably will expand the number of wholly owned clinics we have 
in accordance with the above  for the year ended december   we have classified  of the minority interests in earnings of subsidiary limited partnerships relating to the partnerships formed after january   into salaries and related costs 
as of december    of undistributed minority interests related to the partnerships is classified as other long term liabilities 
this change in classification had no effect on net income at december  no amounts were reclassified in  due to the insignificant amount of minority interest in the partnerships formed between january  and december  see minority interest a subsection of significant accounting policies note in item selected operating and financial data the following table presents selected operating and financial data for the years ended december  working days average visits per day per clinic total patient visits    per visit net revenues salaries and related costs rent  clinic supplies and other provision for doubtful accounts contribution from clinics corporate office costs operating income fiscal year compared to fiscal year net patient revenues net patient revenues increased to million for from million for  an increase of million  or  on a increase in patient visits to  net patient revenues from the clinics opened during the new clinics accounted for of the increase  or million

during and  we accrued income taxes at an effective tax rate of 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents are available to fund the working capital needs of our operating subsidiaries  future clinic development  acquisitions and investments 
included in cash and cash equivalents at december  was million in a money market fund invested in short term debt instruments issued by an agency of the us government 
the decrease in cash of  from december  to december  is due primarily to cash used in financing activities of million and million in fixed asset and intangible purchases  offset by million in cash provided by operating activities 
in  we used million in cash to repurchase  shares of our common stock  made million in distributions to minority investors in subsidiary limited partnerships and repaid a  note payable 
cash was provided by proceeds of million from the exercises of stock options 
our current ratio increased to to at december  from to at december  the increase in the current ratio is due primarily to a decrease in the current portion of notes payable 
at december   we had a debt to equity ratio of to compared to to at december  the decrease in the debt to equity ratio from december  to december  resulted from achieving net income of million  the conversion of  in subordinated notes into common stock  and realizing proceeds of million and tax benefits of million from the exercise of stock options 
in   of a convertible subordinated note was converted into common stock  leaving a remaining balance of million 
we do not currently have credit lines or other credit arrangements 
historically  we have generated sufficient cash from operations to fund our development activities and cover operational needs 
we generally do not acquire new clinics through acquisitions of existing clinics  but prefer developing and opening new clinics  which we believe generally requires less capital 
we currently plan to continue developing new clinics  although this strategy may change if attractive opportunities become available 
we have from time to time purchased the minority interests of limited partners in our clinic partnerships 
we may purchase additional minority interests in the future 
generally  any purchases of minority interests are expected to be accomplished using a combination of common stock and cash 
we believe that existing funds  supplemented by cash flows from existing operations  will be sufficient to meet our current operating needs  development plans and any purchases of minority interests through at least in  we completed the repurchase of  shares for million including expenses 
these purchases  combined with previous plan purchases bring total treasury stock purchases to  at december  pursuant to our stock purchase plan  which authorized  shares 
on february   our board of directors board authorized a new share repurchase program of up to  additional shares of our outstanding common stock 
as there is no expiration for this board authorization  additional shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market or private transactions depending on price  availability and our cash position

in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities  sfas which addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance set forth in eitf issue no

sfas is effective for us beginning in we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee

we expect to incur initial operating losses from the new clinics  which will impact our operating results 
generally we experience losses during the initial period of a new clinic s operation 
operating margins for newly opened clinics tend to be lower than more seasoned clinics because of start up costs and lower patient visits and revenues 
patient visits and revenues gradually increases in the first year of operation  as patients and referral sources become aware of the new clinic 
revenues tend to increase significantly during the two to three years following the first anniversary of a clinic opening 
based on historical performance of our new clinics  the clinics opened in should favorably impact our results of operations beginning in convertible subordinated debt in may we issued million of convertible subordinated notes  series c due june  the series c notes 
the series c convertible subordinated note is convertible at the option of the holder into the number of shares of our common stock determined by dividing the principal amount of the notes being converted by per share 
in june   of the series c notes were converted by the note holders into  shares of common stock 
the remaining principal amount under the series c note was million at december  and million at december  if our share price is not at or above in june  it is likely that the note holders would not convert and we would have to use cash to repay the remaining series c note 
see note payable in note of item the debt conversion increased our shareholders equity by the carrying amount of the debt converted less unamortized deferred financing costs  thus improving our debt to equity ratio and favorably impacting results of operations and cash flow due to the interest savings in before income taxes of approximately  item a
