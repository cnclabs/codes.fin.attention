the company s profitability depends primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from its interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is dependent upon the interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates  deposit flows and loan demand 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its noninterest income and expenses  the provision for loan loss reserves  and its effective income tax rate 
noninterest income consists primarily of loan and other banking fees 
noninterest expense consists of compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment related expenses  data processing expenses  advertising expense  deposit insurance premiums and other operating expenses 
the company s profitability is also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
since the properties underlying the company s mortgages are concentrated in the new york city area and the state of florida  the economic conditions in those areas can also have an impact on the company s operations

see the discussion entitled comparison of financial condition at december  and that follows later in this report for a further discussion of these factors 
the higher provision was largely a function of loan growth of  in versus  in as well as an increase in the bank s internal reserve percentages used in calculating the allowance 
noninterest income noninterest income includes fees from customer service charges  income from mortgage lending activities which consists mostly of fees from expired loan commitments and loan servicing  maintenance and inspections charges  and income from the early repayment of mortgage loans which consists largely of the recognition of unearned fees associated with such loans at the time of payoff and the receipt of prepayment penalties in certain cases

many of the company s mortgage loans include prepayment provisions  and others prohibit prepayment of indebtedness entirely 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses increased to  in  from  in  excluding approximately  of nonrecurring expenses in associated with the merger of intervest bank into intervest national bank

and related interpretations 
future compensation expense related to the modified warrants will fluctuate up or down but not less than  recorded through the date of the second modification until december  and will be a function of the company s class a common stock price and number of warrants outstanding and exercised 
the increase in data processing expenses was due to growth in the bank s assets 
the bank engages a third party servicer for its main data processing and the fee is a function of the bank s total assets  which increased to  at december   from  at december  the increase in occupancy and equipment expenses was primarily due to increased depreciation expense and higher real estate taxes and maintenance charges  including insurance and security protection expenses

the loan portfolio has historically been concentrated in commercial real estate and multifamily mortgage loans 
such loans represented of the total loan portfolio at december  and loan concentrations are defined as amounts loaned to a number of borrowers engaged in similar activities  which would cause the loans to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
credit risk  which represents the possibility of the company not recovering amounts due from its borrowers  is significantly related to local economic conditions in the areas the properties are located  as well as the company s underwriting standards 
economic conditions affect the market value of the underlying collateral as well as the levels of occupancy of income producing properties such as office buildings  shopping centers and rental and cooperative apartment buildings

accrued interest receivable previously recognized is reversed when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
amortization of net deferred fee income is discontinued for loans placed on nonaccrual status 
interest payments received on loans in nonaccrual status are recognized as income on a cash basis unless future collections of principal are doubtful  in which case the payments received are applied as a reduction of principal 
loans remain on nonaccrual status until principal and interest payments are current 
at december   there were no nonaccrual or impaired loans 
at december   one commercial real estate loan with a principal balance of  was on a nonaccrual status and considered impaired under the criteria of sfas no 
at december   there was no valuation allowance recorded for this impaired loan 
in the second quarter of  the property collateralizing the impaired loan was acquired through foreclosure and transferred to foreclosed real estate at estimated fair value less estimated selling costs 
a loan charge off of  was recorded against the allowance for loan loss reserves in connection with this transfer 
interest that was not accrued on this loan under its contractual terms amounted to  in and  in allowance for loan loss reserves at december   the allowance for loan loss reserves increased to  from  at december  the increase was largely a function of loan growth of  in  versus  in as well as an increase in the internal reserve percentages used by the company in calculating the allowance 
at december  and  the allowance for loan loss reserves was predominately allocated to commercial real estate  multifamily and land loans 
the following table sets forth information with respect to the allowance for loan loss reserves for the year ended december  in thousands allowance at beginning of year   provision charged to operations  chargeoffs recoveries allowance at end of year   ratio of allowance to total loans  net of deferred fees total loans  net of deferred fees at year end   average loans outstanding during the year   the allowance for loan loss reserves is established through a provision charged to operations 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated monthly or more frequently when necessary with consideration given to the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  loan concentrations  specific problem loans and commitments and estimates of fair value thereof  historical chargeoffs and recoveries  adverse situations which may affect the borrowers ability to repay  and management s perception of the current and anticipated economic conditions in the company s lending areas 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan loss reserves  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions  or other factors  differ from those assumed in the determination of the level of the allowance 
in addition  sfas no 
specifies the manner in which the portion of the allowance for loan loss reserves related to impaired loans is computed 
a loan is normally deemed impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect both full principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment for larger balance loans such as commercial real estate and multifamily loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the observable market price of the loan  or the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral  if payment of the principal and interest is dependent upon the collateral 
when the fair value of the property is less than the recorded investment in the loan  this deficiency is recognized as a valuation allowance within the overall allowance for loan loss reserves and a charge through the provision for loan loss reserves 
the company s policy is to charge off any portion of the recorded investment in the loan that exceeds the fair value of the collateral 
the net carrying amount of an impaired loan does not at any time exceed the recorded investment in the loan 
the company considers a variety of factors in determining whether a loan is impaired  including i any notice from the borrower that the borrower will be unable to repay all principal and interest amounts contractually due under the loan agreement  ii any delinquency in the principal and or interest payments other than minimum delays or shortfalls in payments  and iii other information known by management that would indicate the full repayment of principal and interest is not probable 
in evaluating loans for impairment  management generally considers delinquencies of days or less to be minimum delays  and accordingly does not consider such delinquent loans to be impaired in the absence of other indications 
impaired loans normally consist of loans on nonaccrual status 
generally  all loans are evaluated for impairment on a loan by loan basis  except for smaller balance homogeneous loans  such as consumer loans  whose evaluation for impairment is done on an aggregate basis 
for consumer loans  historical charge off experience as well as the chargeoff experience of peer groups and industry statistics are used to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss reserves 
the company s regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan loss reserves 
accordingly  the company may be required to take certain chargeoffs and or recognize additions to the allowance based on the regulators judgment concerning information available to them during their examination 
foreclosed real estate at december   foreclosed real estate amounted to  and represented one commercial real estate property located in the state of florida that was acquired by the bank as discussed previously 
the property is actively being marketed for sale 
foreclosed real estate is carried at the lower of the new cost basis or estimated fair value less estimated selling costs 
revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation allowance of the property are included in the consolidated statements of earnings

all other assets the following table sets forth the composition of all other assets at december  in thousands accrued interest receivable   loans fee receivable   premises and equipment  net   deferred income tax asset   deferred debenture offering costs  net   all other accrued interest receivable fluctuates based on the amount of loans  investments and other interest earning assets outstanding and the timing of interest payments received 
the increase was due to the growth in these assets 
loan fees receivable are fees due to the company in accordance with the terms of mortgage loans 
such amounts are generally due upon the full repayment of the loan 
this fee is recorded as deferred income at the time a loan is originated and is then amortized to interest income over the life of the loan as a yield adjustment 
the increase was due to an increase in mortgage loan originations 
premises and equipment is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
premises and equipment increased due to purchases exceeding normal amortization and depreciation during the year 
in  the bank purchased a property that is across from its court street branch office in florida at a cost of  this property was purchased primarily to provide additional parking for the branch 
the deferred income tax asset relates primarily to the unrealized tax benefit on the company s allowance for loan loss reserves  depreciation  and organizational start up costs 
these charges have been expensed for financial statement purposes  but are not all currently deductible for income tax purposes 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income by the company during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible for tax purposes 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the company s deferred tax asset will be realized and accordingly  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is not maintained 
deferred debenture offering costs consist primarily of underwriters commissions and are amortized over the terms of the debentures 
the increase was due to additional costs  incurred with the sale of new debentures in by intervest mortgage corporation  partially offset by normal amortization 
deposits consolidated deposit liabilities increased to  at december   from  at december   reflecting growth in deposit accounts during the year 
management believes that the bank does not have a concentration of deposits from any one source and that a large portion of its depositors are residents in the bank s primary market areas although there has been growth in deposits from outside the primary areas resulting from the bank s deposit gathering activities through its web site on the internet www

the fdic improvement act of  among other things  established five capital categories ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized 
such classifications are used by the fdic and other bank regulatory agencies to determine various matters  including prompt corrective action and each institution s fdic deposit insurance premium assessments 
the capital categories involve quantitative measures of a bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the bank is required to maintain  for regulatory compliance and reporting purposes  regulatory defined minimum tier leverage and tier and total risk based capital ratio levels of at least  and  respectively

the bank is a well capitalized institution as defined in the regulations  which require minimum tier leverage and tier and total risk based ratios of  and  respectively 
management believes that there are no current conditions or events outstanding which would change the bank s designation as a well capitalized institution

the primary objective of the company s asset liability management strategy is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital 
this strategy is overseen in part through the direction of the asset and liability committee alco of the board of directors of the bank  which establishes policies and monitors results to control interest rate sensitivity 
the company uses gap analysis  which measures the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within a given time period  to monitor its interest rate sensitivity 
an asset or liability is normally considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within one year 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  a gap is considered negative when the opposite is true 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if the repricing of the company s assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates for the following reasons 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  may have features generally referred to as interest rate caps or collars  which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  asset prepayment and early deposit withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase  and the behavior of depositors may be different than those assumed in the gap analysis 
the company s one year positive interest rate sensitivity gap was at december   compared to at december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in variable rate loans funded by an increase in certificate of deposits with a term of over one year 
for purposes of computing the gap  of deposits with no stated maturities are treated as readily accessible accounts 
however  if such deposits were treated differently  then the gap would change 
the behavior of core depositors may not necessarily result in the immediate withdrawal of funds in the event deposit rates offered by the bank did not change as quickly and uniformly as changes in general market rates 
for example  if only of deposits with no stated maturity were assumed to be readily accessible  the one year gap would have been a positive at year end  compared to a positive at year end the company has a floor  or minimum rate  on many of its floating rate loans that is determined in relation to prevailing market rates on the date of origination 
this floor only adjusts upwards in the event of increases in the loan s interest rate 
this feature reduces the effect on interest income in a falling rate environment 
notwithstanding all of the above  there can be no assurances that a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may not adversely impact the company s earnings  to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis

fixed rate loans are scheduled  including repayments  according to their contractual maturities  securities are scheduled according to the earlier of their contractual maturity or the date in which the interest rate is scheduled to increase 
the effects of possible prepayments that may result from the issuer s right to call a security before its contractual maturity date are not considered 
interest checking  savings and money market deposits are regarded as ready accessible withdrawable accounts  and certificates of deposit are scheduled through their maturity dates 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this topic 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data concerning the company presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on the performance of the company than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities  and the issuance of its debentures 
the company has not engaged in and accordingly has no risk related to trading accounts  commodities or foreign exchange 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments as of december  and  which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management actively monitors and manages the company s interest rate risk exposure 
the primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital
