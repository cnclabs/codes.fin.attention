customers we provide our training and education solutions to customers across a broad range of entities within the healthcare industry  including healthcare organizations including government entities and pharmaceutical and medical device companies 
the following is a partial list of customers that have purchased or contracted for products and services from healthstream 
healthcare organizations pharmaceutical companies medical device companies hca inc banner health coxhealth trinity health novi  mi medicis pharmaceutical corporation merck co  inc zimmer  inc 
medtronic  inc sales  marketing  and customer support we market products and services primarily through our direct sales force 
as of december   our sales and relationship management personnel consisted of approximately employees based at our corporate headquarters in nashville  tennessee and in denver  colorado  as well as remote home office sales locations 
our geographically dispersed field sales organization is divided into two groups one is focused on healthcare organizations and the other on sales to pharmaceutical and medical device companies 
the inside sales personnel support the field sales force by responding to initial inquiries  qualifying sales leads  preparing proposals and preparing sales contracts 
in addition to sales professionals  we also employ program managers  who are responsible for live event services and work to develop and expand relationships with pharmaceutical and medical device companies 
we anticipate modest growth in our sales and relationship management personnel during we conduct a variety of marketing programs to promote our products and services  including product catalogs  trade shows  telemarketing campaigns  public relations  distribution of product specific literature  direct mail  online promotion and advertising 
we also conduct geographically focused meetings with target customers and user groups with existing customers 
we believe our ability to establish and maintain long term customer relationships  adoption of our products and services and recurring sales are dependent on the strength of our customer service and operations team 
our customer service and support team consists of approximately employees located in our corporate headquarters in nashville 
this team provides customer support to end users through a toll free telephone line as well as electronic mail 
our representatives are trained to understand our philosophy and corporate culture and our specific sales  marketing and support issues 
this team also includes our account management group that maintains an ongoing dialog with our customer base to ensure a complete understanding of customer needs 
these personnel also assist with ongoing issues and training of our products as well as to ensure anticipated returns are achieved 
the remaining personnel on this team are responsible for training and implementation of hlc customers 
technology management our technology infrastructure is based on an open architecture and is designed to be secure  reliable and expandable 
our software is a combination of proprietary applications  third party database software and operating systems that support acquisition and conversion of content  hosting and management of that content  publication of our web sites  downloads of courseware  registration and tracking of 
table of contents users and reporting of information for both internal and external use 
we have designed this infrastructure to allow each component to be independently scaled by adding readily available hardware and software components 
our network infrastructure  web sites and servers that deliver our services are hosted by a third party provider 
this provider maintains our equipment in a secure environment  including multiple redundancies in power sources and network connections 
our provider s hosting center is connected to the internet through multiple  redundant high speed fiber optic circuits 
monitoring of all servers  networks and systems is performed by company personnel on a continuous basis 
together with our provider  we employ numerous levels of firewall systems to protect our databases  customer information and content library 
backups of all databases  data and content files are performed on a daily basis 
data back up tapes are archived at a secure remote location on a weekly basis 
competition the healthcare education industry is highly fragmented  varies significantly in delivery methods ie  written materials  live events  satellite broadcasts  video  cd rom products and online products and is composed of a wide variety of entities competing for customers 
the sheer volume of healthcare information available to satisfy continuing education needs  rapid advances in medical developments and the time constraints that healthcare professionals face make it difficult to quickly and efficiently access the continuing education content most relevant to an individual s practice or profession 
historically  healthcare professionals have received continuing education and training through offline publications  such as medical journals and cd roms  and by attending conferences and seminars 
in addition  other healthcare workers and pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers sales and internal regulatory personnel usually fulfill their education and training needs through instructor led programs from external vendors or internal training departments 
while these approaches satisfy the ongoing requirements  they are limited in that they are typically costly and inconvenient 
in addition  live courses are often limited in the breadth of offerings and do not provide a method for tracking training completion 
the related results of these traditional methods  both from a business and compliance standpoint  are difficult to track and measure 
in addition to the competing delivery methods described above  we also have direct competitors 
a number of smaller privately held companies offer competitive installed and web based learning management products to the healthcare industry 
in addition  we also compete with large scale learning management system providers such as skillsoft  digitalthink  saba and docent that provide their services to multiple industries  including healthcare 
we believe our solutions  which include both products and services that facilitate training for healthcare professionals  a wide assortment of content  a mechanism for measuring results and the ability to provide all services on a single platform over the internet  provide us with a competitive advantage 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the marketing of e learning services to the healthcare industry include features of the hlc product  including reporting  management functionality  scalability and the ability to track utilization and results  scope and variety of internet based learning content available  including mandated content for osha  jcaho and hipaa requirements  competency based content  as well as the ability of entities to add their own web enabled content  scope and quality of professional services offered  including training and the expertise and technical knowledge of the providers employees  ability to access and leverage an existing customer base to increase exposure for pharmaceutical and medical device companies  pricing  customer service and support  effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts  and company reputation 

table of contents government regulation of the internet and the healthcare industry the internet the laws and regulations that govern our business change rapidly 
the united states government and the governments of some states and foreign countries have attempted to regulate activities on the internet 
the following are some of the evolving areas of law that are relevant to our business privacy law 
current and proposed federal  state and foreign privacy regulations and other laws restricting the collection  use  confidentiality and disclosure of personal information could limit our ability to collect information or use the information in our databases or derived from other sources  to generate revenues 
it may be costly to implement security or other measures designed to comply with any new legislation 
encryption laws 
many copyright owner associations have lobbied the federal government for laws requiring copyrighted materials transmitted over the internet to be digitally encrypted in order to track rights and prevent unauthorized use of copyrighted materials 
if these laws are adopted  we may incur substantial costs to comply with these requirements or change the way we do business 
content regulation 
both foreign and domestic governments have adopted and proposed laws governing the content of material transmitted over the internet 
these include laws relating to obscenity  indecency  libel and defamation 
we could be liable if content delivered by us violates these regulations 
sales and use tax 
through december   we collected sales  use or other taxes on taxable transactions in all states in which we have employees 
while healthstream expects that this approach is appropriate  other states or foreign jurisdictions may seek to impose tax collection obligations on companies like us that engage in online commerce 
if they do  these obligations could limit the growth of electronic commerce in general and limit our ability to profit from the sale of our services over the internet 
the enactment of any additional laws or regulations may increase our cost of conducting business or otherwise harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
laws and regulations directly applicable to e commerce and internet communications are becoming more prevalent 
recent sessions of congress enacted internet laws regarding online copyright infringement 
congress continues considering laws regarding internet taxation 
the dynamic nature of this regulatory environment increases the uncertainty regarding the marketplace impact of such regulation 
regulation of education and training for healthcare professionals allied disciplines 
various allied health professionals are required to obtain continuing education to maintain their licenses 
for example  emergency medical services personnel may be required to acquire up to continuing education hours per year 
these requirements vary by state and depend on the classification of the employee 
occupational safety and health administration osha 
osha regulations require employers to provide training to employees to minimize the risk of injury from various potential workplace hazards 
employers in the healthcare industry are required to provide training with respect to various topics  including blood borne pathogens exposure control  laboratory safety and tuberculosis infection control 
osha regulations require employers to keep records of their employees completion of training with respect to these workplace hazards 
joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations jcaho 
jcaho mandates that employers in the healthcare industry provide certain workplace safety and patient interaction training to employees 
jcaho required training may include programs on infection control  patient bill of rights  radiation safety and incident reporting 
healthcare organizations are required to provide and document training on these topics to receive jcaho accreditation 
in addition  jcaho imposes continuing education requirements on physicians that relate to each physician s specific staff appointments 
health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa hipaa regulations require organizations who maintain or transmit health information electronically to provide reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect the integrity and confidentiality of healthcare information 
employers in the healthcare industry are required to establish  maintain and provide training with regard to their policies and procedures for protecting the integrity and confidentiality of healthcare information 
healthcare organizations are required to document training on these topics to support their compliance 

table of contents continuing education ce 
state nurse practice laws are usually the source of authority for establishing the state board of nursing  which then establishes the state s ce requirements for professional nurses 
the continuing education units programs are accredited by the american nurses credentialing center commission on accreditation and or the state board of nursing 
ce requirements vary widely from state to state 
twenty nine states require some form of ce in order to renew a nurse s license 
in some states  the ce requirement only applies to re licensure of advance practice nurses  or additional ces may be required of this category of nurses 
on average  to ces are required annually  with reporting generally on a bi annual basis 
certifications may also require continuing education credits eg  cnor certification of perioperative nursing 
continuing medical education cme 
state licensing boards  professional organizations and employers require physicians to certify that they have accumulated a minimum number of continuing medical education hours to maintain their licenses 
generally  each state s medical practice laws authorize the state s board of medicine to establish and track cme requirements 
thirty four state medical licensing boards currently have cme requirements 
the number of cme hours required by each state ranges up to hours per year 
other sources of cme requirements are state medical societies and practice specialty boards 
the failure to obtain the requisite amount and type of cme could result in non renewal of the physician s license to practice medicine and or membership in a medical or practice specialty society 
the american medical association s  or ama s  physician recognition award  or pra  is the most widely recognized certificate for acknowledging physician completion of a cme course 
the ama classifies continuing education activities as either category  which includes formal cme activities  or category  which includes most informal activities 
sponsors want to designate cme activities for ama pra category because this has become the benchmark for quality in formally organized educational activities 
almost all agencies nationwide that require cme participation specify ama pra category credit 
only institutions and organizations accredited to provide cme can designate an activity for ama pra category the accreditation council on continuing medical education  or accme  is responsible for the accreditation of medical schools  state medical societies and other institutions and organizations that provide cme activities for a national or regional audience of physicians 
only institutions and organizations are accredited 
the accme and state medical societies do not accredit or approve individual activities 
state medical societies  operating under the aegis of the accme  accredit institutions and organizations that provide cme activities primarily for physicians within the state or bordering states 
we are an accredited provider of cme by the accme 
the us food and drug administration and the federal trade commission current fda and ftc rules and enforcement actions and regulatory policies or those that the fda or the ftc may develop in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide existing or future applications or services to our end users or obtain the necessary corporate sponsorship to do so 
the fda and the ftc regulate the form  content and dissemination of labeling  advertising and promotional materials  including direct to consumer prescription drug and medical device advertising  prepared by  or for  pharmaceutical  biotechnology or medical device companies 
the ftc regulates over the counter drug advertising and  in some cases  medical device advertising 
generally  regulated companies must limit their advertising and promotional materials to discussions of the fda approved claims and  in limited circumstances  to a limited number of claims not approved by the fda 
therefore  any information that promotes the use of pharmaceutical or medical device products that is presented with our service is subject to the full array of the fda and ftc requirements and enforcement actions 
we believe that banner advertisements  sponsorship links and any educational programs that lack independent editorial control that we may present with our service could be subject to fda or ftc regulation 
while the fda and the ftc place the principal burden of compliance with advertising and promotional regulations on the advertiser  if the fda or ftc finds that any regulated information presented with our service violates fda or ftc regulations  they may take regulatory action against us or the advertiser or sponsor of that information 
in  the fda announced it would develop a guidance document expressing a broad set of policies dealing with the promotion of pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device products on the internet 
although the fda has yet to issue that guidance document  agency officials continue to predict its eventual release 
the fda guidance document may reflect new regulatory policies that more tightly regulate the format and content of promotional information on the internet 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights we obtain a portion of our content under license agreements with publishers or authors  through assignments or work for hire arrangements with third parties and from internal staff development 
we require our content partners to represent and warrant that their content does not infringe on any third party copyrights and that they have the right to provide their content and have obtained all third party consents necessary to do so 
our content partners also agree to indemnify us against liability we might sustain due to the content they provide 
to protect our proprietary rights  we rely generally on copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties and license agreements with consultants  vendors and customers 
we own the federal trademark registrations for the mark healthstream

risk factors we believe that the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this document are the principal material risks facing the company as of the date of this report 
in the future  we may become subject to additional risks that are not currently known to us 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the following risks 
risks related to our business model 
our limited operating history makes evaluating our business difficult 
although we were incorporated in  we did not initiate our online operations until march as a result  we have only a limited operating history on which you can base an evaluation of our business and prospects 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies introducing new methods of delivering products and services into a cautious market like the healthcare industry 
our failure to successfully address these risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to attract and maintain a large base of customers  both on the healthcare organization and the pharmaceutical and medical device sides of the business  develop a scalable infrastructure  including additional hardware and software  customer and business support  systems and personnel  to support our business  develop and introduce desirable services and compelling content  establish and maintain strategic relationships with content providers or partners  and respond effectively to competitive and technological developments 
variability and length of our sales cycle for our products and services as well as our product mix may make our operating results unpredictable and volatile 
the period from our initial contact with a potential customer and the first purchase of our solution by the customer typically ranges from three to nine months  and in some cases has extended much further 
in addition  the revenue recognition policies for sales of internet based learning products and other services vary significantly from our installed learning management products and content development services 
as a result of both of these factors  we have only limited ability to forecast the timing and type of sales 
this  in turn  makes it more difficult to predict quarterly financial performance 
failure to effectively manage growth of our operations and infrastructure could disrupt our operations and prevent us from generating the revenues we expect 
we currently are experiencing a period of expansion in our customer utilization patterns and related infrastructure 
we anticipate continued expansion in end user traffic from our internet based learning products and other services 
to manage our growth  we must successfully implement  constantly improve and effectively utilize our operational and financial systems 
our existing or planned operational and financial systems may not be sufficient to support our growth 

table of contents the market for online training and continuing education in the healthcare industry is new and rapidly evolving 
uncertainty as to the level of demand and market acceptance for online training and continuing education in the healthcare industry exposes us to a high degree of risk 
although our sales of hipaa content during were promising  we cannot assure that the healthcare community will completely adopt online training and continuing education as a replacement for  or alternative to  traditional sources of training and continuing education 
if the market for online training and continuing education fails to develop  develops more slowly than expected  becomes saturated with competitors  or e learning does not prove to be an effective method for training  our business will suffer 
failure to adequately address our customers needs in our products and services could prevent our anticipated growth in revenues 
our management may not be able to effectively identify  manage and exploit existing and emerging market opportunities 
if we do not adequately manage our product and service innovation opportunities  our business will suffer 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources 
several of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us  and several of the larger e learning companies have from time to time announced their intentions to enter the healthcare e learning market 
still others offer a lower cost service alternative that may capture a portion of our potential customer base 
in addition  if such competitors were to offer a complete e learning solution to the healthcare industry  our competitive position could be adversely affected 
these companies may be able to respond more quickly than us to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
we may be unable to effectively implement our growth strategy  which could have an adverse effect on our business and competitive position in the industry 
our business strategy includes increasing our market share and presence through sales to new customers  further penetration and additional sales to existing customers  introductions of new products and services and strategic acquisitions that complement or enhance our business 
we may not be able to identify  complete or integrate the operations of historical or future acquisitions 
some of the risks that we may encounter in implementing our growth strategy include expenses  delays and difficulties of integrating new products  services or acquired companies into our existing organization  diversion of management s attention from other business matters  expenses associated with and difficulties in identifying potential new products and services and the costs associated with new products or acquisitions that are not completed  expenses of any undisclosed or potential liabilities of any acquired company  and adverse impact on our financial condition due to the timing of the new product introductions or acquisitions 
if any of these risks are realized  our business could suffer 
our future success depends  in part  on our ability to sell additional content and services to existing customers  as well as obtaining new customers 
we plan to grow our revenues by sales to new customers as well as increasing our sales of content and other services to existing customers 
our identification of additional content and services may not result in timely development of complementary products 
in addition  the success of certain new products and services may be dependent on continued growth in our base of internet based customers 
because healthcare training continues to change and evolve  we may be unable to accurately predict and develop content and other products to address the needs of the healthcare industry 
continued growth of our internet based customer population is dependent on our ability to continue to provide relevant products and services in a timely manner 
the success of our business will depend on our ability to continue providing our products and services as well as continued content and product enhancements to address the needs of the healthcare industry 

table of contents without the continued development and maintenance of the internet and the availability of increased bandwidth to consumers  our business may not succeed 
given the online nature of our business  without the continued development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure  we could fail to meet our overall strategic objectives and ultimately fail to generate the user traffic and revenues we expect 
this continued development of the internet includes maintenance of a reliable network with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  as well as timely development of complementary products for providing reliable internet access and services 
because commerce on the internet and the online exchange of information is evolving  we cannot predict whether the internet will prove to be a viable commercial marketplace in the long term 
the success of our business will rely on the continued improvement of the internet as a convenient and efficient means of information and content distribution 
our business depends on the ability of our end users to access and use our courseware  as well as to conduct commercial transactions with us  without significant delays or aggravation that may be associated with decreased availability of internet bandwidth and access to our web sites 
our penetration of a broader market and sale of additional services to existing customers will depend  in part  on continued proliferation of high speed internet access 
the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic 
as the internet continues to experience increased numbers of users  increased frequency of use and increased bandwidth requirements  the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it 
in addition  increased users or bandwidth requirements may impair the performance of the internet generally or our web sites specifically 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  and it could face outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage as well as the level of traffic  and could result in the internet becoming an inconvenient or uneconomical source of continuing education and training 
the infrastructure and complementary products or services necessary to make the internet a viable educational media and commercial marketplace for the long term may not be developed successfully or in a timely manner 
even if these products or services are developed  the internet may not become a viable educational medium and commercial marketplace for the services that we offer 
protection of certain proprietary trademarks and domain names may be difficult and costly 
despite protection of certain proprietary trademarks and domain names  a third party could  without authorization  copy or otherwise appropriate our content or other information from our database 
our agreements with employees  consultants and others who participate in development activities could be breached 
we may not have adequate remedies for any breach  and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in those jurisdictions 
we currently hold several domain names 
the legal status of intellectual property on the internet is currently subject to various uncertainties 
the current system for registering  allocating and managing domain names has been the subject of litigation and proposed regulatory reform 
additionally  legislative proposals have been made by the federal government that would afford broad protection to owners of databases of information  such as stock quotes 
this protection of databases already exists in the european union 
there have been substantial amounts of litigation in the computer and online industries regarding intellectual property assets 
third parties may claim infringement by us with respect to current and future products  trademarks or other proprietary rights  and we may counterclaim against such parties in such actions 
any such claims or counterclaims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention  cause product release delays  require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and operating results 
such royalty and licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
financial risks our limited operating history may prevent us from forecasting our revenues accurately 
as a result of our limited operating history  we do not have historical financial data for a significant number of periods upon which to forecast quarterly revenues and results of operations 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  our operating results may vary substantially 
this variability results primarily from the differences in revenue recognition for our various products and services 
the actual effect of these factors on the price of our stock  however  will be difficult to assess due to our limited operating history 
in one or more future quarters  our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  and the trading price of our common stock may decline 

table of contents we expect net losses in the future and acceptable profitability results may not materialize 
in  we had a net loss of approximately million 
at december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect continued net losses and negative cash flow through at least the third quarter of there is no assurance that we will become profitable 
our revenue recognition is dependent upon achievement of certain events  and our inability to recognize revenue in accordance with our expectations will harm our operating results 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  our ability to record revenues depends upon several factors 
these factors include completion and acceptance by our customers of developed content and courseware 
utilization of courseware is required in connection with subscription internet based learning products and commercial support arrangements 
while our customer contracts have not historically provided for minimum levels of participant registration or course completion  customer requirements may demand such contract features in the future 
further  delivery of customer specific data is required for us to implement customers on our internet based learning platform 
accordingly  if customers do not provide us with the specified information in a timely manner  our ability to recognize revenues will be delayed  which could adversely impact our operating results 
we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives unless we obtain additional financing  which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
the net proceeds of our initial public offering  or ipo  and the preceding private offerings of our common and preferred stock  together with our current cash reserves  are expected to be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least however  we may need to raise additional funds in order to acquire complementary businesses  technology  content or products  finance working capital requirements  develop or enhance existing services or products  respond to competitive pressures  sustain content  distribution and development relationships  or maintain required infrastructure to support our business 
at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash  investments in marketable securities and related interest receivable 
we have commitments to pay approximately  in related to certain agreements with various content partners and other strategic alliance agreements 
we expect to incur approximately to million of capital expenditures during to support our business 
we expect negative cash flows to continue through at least september  and operating losses to continue through at least we cannot assure that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund expansion  take advantage of available opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our shareholders will be reduced  and these securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our shareholders 
revenues from content depend  in part  on our obtaining proper ownership and distribution rights from our content partners 
most of our agreements with content providers are for initial terms of one to three years 
the content partners may choose not to renew their agreements with us or may terminate the agreements early if we do not fulfill our contractual obligations 
if a significant number of our content providers terminate or fail to renew their agreements with us on acceptable terms  it could result in a reduction in the number of courses we are able to distribute and decreased revenues 
most of our agreements with our content partners are also non exclusive  and our competitors offer  or could offer  training and continuing education content that is similar to or the same as ours 
if publishers and authors  including our current content partners  offer information to users or our competitors on more favorable terms than those offered to us or increase our license fees  our competitive position and our profit margins and prospects could be harmed 
in addition  the failure by our content partners to deliver high quality content and to continuously upgrade their content in response to user demand and evolving healthcare advances and trends could result in user dissatisfaction and inhibit our ability to attract users 

table of contents risks related to sales  marketing and competition we expect competition to increase in the future which could reduce our revenues  potential profits and overall market share 
the market for traditional and online training and continuing education services is competitive 
barriers to entry on the internet are relatively low  and we expect competition to increase in the future 
we face competitive pressures from numerous actual and potential competitors  both online and offline  many of which have longer operating histories  greater brand name recognition  larger consumer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
there is no assurance that online training and continuing education services provided by our existing and potential competitors will not be perceived by the healthcare community as being superior to ours 
if we fail to collect accurate and useful data about our end users  potential content partners may not support our services  which may result in reduced courseware revenues 
we plan to use utilization data about our end users to expand  refine and target our marketing and sales efforts 
we collect most of our data from end users who report information to us as they register for courses on our web site 
if a large proportion of users are unwilling to provide data or if they falsify data  our marketing and sales efforts would be less effective  since content partners generally require detailed demographic data on their target audiences 
in addition  laws relating to privacy and the use of the internet to collect personal information could limit our ability to collect data and utilize our database 
failure to collect accurate and useful data could result in a substantial reduction in courseware revenues 
risks related to operations we may be unable to adequately develop our systems  processes and support in a manner that will enable us to meet the demand for our services 
we have provided our online products and services for less than four years and continue to develop our ability to provide our courses and education management systems on both a subscription and transactional basis over the internet 
our future success will depend on our ability to effectively develop the infrastructure  including additional hardware and software  and implement the services  including customer support  necessary to meet the demand for our services 
our inability from time to time to successfully develop the necessary systems and implement the necessary services on a timely basis has resulted in our customers experiencing some delays or interruptions in their service 
such delays or interruptions may cause customers to become dissatisfied with our service and move to competing providers of traditional and online training and education services 
if this happens  our revenues could be adversely affected  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from hca  and the termination of our agreement with hca would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we provide our internet based training and education services to hca information technology services  inc hca pursuant to an agreement that expires in october during  we derived  or million  of our net revenues from hca pursuant to this agreement 
hca has the right to terminate this agreement if we fail to deliver the required services under this agreement on a timely basis 
a termination of our agreement with hca would have a material adverse effect on our business as well as our ability to secure other large customers for the services of our healthcare learning center 
our business operations could be significantly disrupted if we lose members of  or fail to integrate  our management team 
our future performance will be substantially dependent on the continued services of our management team and our ability to retain and motivate them 
the loss of the services of any of our officers or senior managers could harm our business  as we may not be able to find suitable replacements 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel  other than our chief executive officer  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
we may not be able to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees and  as a result  we may not be able to grow as we expect or maintain the quality of our services 
our future success will depend on our ability to attract  train  retain and motivate other highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and customer support personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  especially for developers  web designers and sales personnel  and we may be unable to successfully attract sufficiently qualified personnel 
we have experienced difficulty in the past hiring qualified personnel in a timely manner for these positions 
the pool of qualified technical personnel  in particular  is limited in nashville  tennessee  which is where our headquarters are located 
we will need to maintain the size of our staff to support our anticipated growth  without compromising the quality of our offerings or customer service 
our inability to locate  hire  integrate and retain qualified personnel in sufficient numbers may reduce the quality of our services 
we must continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure to effectively meet demand for our services 
we must continue to add hardware and enhance software to accommodate the increased content in our library and increased use of our web site 
in order to make timely decisions about hardware and software enhancements  we must be able to accurately forecast the growth in demand for our services 
this growth in demand for our services is difficult to forecast and the potential audience for 
table of contents our services is large 
if we are unable to increase the data storage and processing capacity of our systems at least as fast as the growth in demand  our systems may become unstable and our customers may encounter delays or disruptions in their service 
unscheduled downtime could harm our business and also could discourage current and potential end users and reduce future revenues 
our data and web server systems may stop working or work improperly due to natural disasters  failure of third party services and other unexpected problems 
an unexpected event like a power or telecommunications failure  fire  flood  earthquake  or other catastrophic loss at our on site data facility or at our internet service providers facilities could cause the loss of critical data and prevent us from offering our services 
our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 
in addition  we rely on third parties to securely store our archived data  house our web server and network systems and connect us to the internet 
while our service providers have planned for certain contingencies  the failure by any of these third parties to provide these services satisfactorily and our inability to find suitable replacements would impair our ability to access archives and operate our systems 
we may lose users and lose revenues if our online security measures fail 
if the security measures that we use to protect personal information are ineffective  we may lose users of our services  which could reduce our revenues 
we rely on security and authentication technology licensed from third parties 
with this technology  we perform real time credit card authorization and verification 
we cannot predict whether these security measures could be circumvented by new technological developments 
in addition  our software  databases and servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
we may need to spend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches 
we cannot assure that we can prevent all security breaches 
risks related to government regulation  content and intellectual property government regulation may require us to change the way we do business 
the laws and regulations that govern our business change rapidly 
the united states government and the governments of states and foreign countries have attempted to regulate activities on the internet 
evolving areas of law that are relevant to our business include privacy law  proposed encryption laws  content regulation and sales and use tax laws and regulations 
because of this rapidly evolving and uncertain regulatory environment  we cannot predict how these laws and regulations might affect our business 
in addition  these uncertainties make it difficult to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations governing the internet 
these laws and regulations could harm us by subjecting us to liability or forcing us to change how we do business 
see business government regulation of the internet and the healthcare industry for a more complete discussion of these laws and regulations 
we may be liable to third parties for content that is available from our online library 
we may be liable to third parties for the content in our online library if the text  graphics  software or other content in our library violates copyright  trademark  or other intellectual property rights  our content partners violate their contractual obligations to others by providing content to our library or the content does not conform to accepted standards of care in the healthcare profession 
we may also be liable for anything that is accessible from our web site through links to other web sites 
we attempt to minimize these types of liabilities by requiring representations and warranties relating to our content partners ownership of the rights to distribute as well as the accuracy of their content 
we also take necessary measures to review this content ourselves 
although our agreements with our content partners contain provisions providing for indemnification by the content providers in the event of inaccurate content  we cannot assure that our content partners will have the financial resources to meet this obligation 
alleged liability could harm our business by damaging our reputation  requiring us to incur legal costs in defense  exposing us to awards of damages and costs and diverting management s attention away from our business 
see business intellectual property and other proprietary rights for a more complete discussion of the potential effects of this liability on our business 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property  and we may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
our business could be harmed if unauthorized parties infringe upon or misappropriate our proprietary systems  content  services or other information 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property through copyright  trademarks and other controls may not be adequate 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  which could be time consuming and costly 
intellectual property infringement claims could be made against us as the number of our competitors grows 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert our attention from operating our company 
in addition  if we become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and develop comparable non infringing intellectual property  to obtain a license or to cease providing the content or services that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop non infringing intellectual property or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 

table of contents any reduction or change in the regulation of continuing education and training in the healthcare industry may adversely affect our business 
our business model is dependent in part on required training and continuing education for healthcare professionals and other healthcare workers resulting from regulations of state and federal agencies  state licensing boards and professional organizations 
any change in these regulations that reduce the requirements for continuing education and training for the healthcare industry could harm our business 
in addition  our business with pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers is predicated on our ability to maintain accreditation status with organizations such as the accreditation council for continuing medical education accme  american nurses credentialing center ancc  american council for pharmaceutical education acpe and others 
the failure to maintain status as an accredited provider could result in a detrimental effect on our business

this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
healthstream s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed and those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to  those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion provides an overview of our history together with a summary of our revenue recognition policies  product development policies  policy regarding impairment of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  and the significant current year transactions 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  product development costs and related capitalization  impairment of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  and accounting for strategic alliances and acquisitions 
overview and critical accounting policies and estimates healthstream was incorporated in and began marketing its internet based solutions in march the company evolved from an initial focus of providing multimedia tools for information dissemination to a facilitator of training tools for entities in the healthcare industry 
revenues from the healthcare organizations business unit hco are derived from the following categories provision of services through our internet based learning products  content subscriptions  licensing  maintenance and support of installed learning management products  content subscriptions  custom content development and a variety of online and enduring products 
revenues from the pharmaceutical and medical device company business unit pmd are derived from live event development  coordination and registration services  online development and training  web cast events  and other educational and training services 
revenue recognition internet based learning products including our healthcare learning center tm hlc and content subscriptions are provided on a per person subscription basis  with fees ranging from less than to more than per month  based on the size of the facilities employee population and the content offerings to which they subscribe 
contracts for e learning products generally range from  to 
table of contents approximately  based on the duration of the contract  number of users and content involved 
revenue derived from the provision of services through our internet based learning products are recognized ratably over the term of the service agreement 
the company also offers training services for clients to facilitate integration of this technology 
fees for training are based on the time and efforts of the personnel involved 
other transaction based online services are provided based on a fee ranging from to per underlying credit hour  or based upon access to a body of content for a defined period of time 
most courses provide one to three credit hours  however  during we began selling board review courses that include significantly more credit 
we recognize revenue for all content subscription services ratably over the subscription period and recognize revenue for transaction based online course sales when the course is delivered 
training revenues are generally recognized upon completion of training services 
late in  we began entering into arrangements that provide for commercial support of online courseware 
such revenue is recognized based on an estimate of usage ratably over the term unless usage varies from this estimate 
as discussed in risk factors above  revenue recognition policies for internet based learning products and other services vary significantly from our installed learning management products 
revenues from installed learning management products are recognized upon shipment or installation of the software 
the one time license fee typically ranges from  to  based on the number of users 
revenues related to installed learning management products may be subject to seasonal fluctuations because purchases of these licenses typically are included in customers capital expenditure budgets 
training services are typically based on the length of the related training course 
such training revenues are typically recognized upon completion of the training services 
maintenance and technical support revenues are typically based on a percentage of the original contract amount and are recognized over the term of the service period 
revenues derived from content development services or the sale of products requiring significant modification  conversion or customization are recorded based on the percentage of completion method using labor hours 
we recognize custom content development revenues based on the percentage of a project that is completed 
we recognize revenue from online and live event development and coordination services based on the percentage of completion method using labor hours or similar event milestones 
this methodology requires ongoing estimates regarding the total expenses or significant milestones associated with the project as well as periodic estimates of the progress with respect to completion of such projects 
event registration services are recognized upon completion of the related event and are based on estimates of event registration note our registration fees do not vary based on the number of registrants unless there is an incongruency with the initial estimate 
revenues associated with online training are recognized over the term of the service period or over the historical usage period  if usage typically differs from the service period 
all other service revenues  including web cast events  are recognized as the related services are performed or products are delivered 
sales of products and services to pharmaceutical and medical device companies can be subject to seasonal factors as a result of drug and product introductions  meeting and conference dates and budget cycles for such companies 
we expect to continue to generate revenues by marketing our internet based products and services to healthcare workers through healthcare organizations 
we expect that the portion of our revenues related to services provided via our internet based learning products will increase 
specifically  we will seek to generate revenues from healthcare workers by marketing to their employers or sponsoring organizations 
the transaction fees for courseware resulting from this marketing may either be paid by the employer or sponsoring organization or  in the case of healthcare professionals  may be billed directly to the individual 
our internet based learning model allows us to host our system in a central data center  therefore eliminating the need for costly onsite installations of our software 
under the internet based learning model  revenues are generated by charging for use of our courseware on a subscription basis 
in addition  we will continue to sell services on our web site on a transaction basis 
we expect to continue to transition customers from our existing installed learning management platforms to our internet based learning products 
we expect that revenues resulting from transition customers will remain comparable or increase when compared to the annual maintenance fees due to sales of additional content and courseware 
product development costs product development costs include the costs to maintain and internally develop and convert content for our internet based learning and installed learning management products 
once technological feasibility is achieved  we capitalize the cost of content developed by third parties where the life expectancy is greater than one year and the anticipated cash flows from such content is expected to exceed the cost of the content 
during and  we capitalized approximately  and million  respectively  related to third party content development 
such amounts are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under the caption prepaid development fees 
we amortize content development over its expected life  which is generally one to two years 
product development and content development costs that have been capitalized are subject to a periodic impairment review in accordance with our policy 
during and  we recorded impairment charges of approximately  and  respectively  with respect to certain content development fees 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents we account for web site development costs in accordance with eitf issue no 
accounting for web site development costs  which provides guidance on when to capitalize versus expense costs incurred to develop a web site 
product development costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of computer software products  such as our installed learning management products that are developed for resale  and internet based learning products and web sites prior to june  were charged to expense as incurred 
we capitalize costs incurred between the point of establishing technological feasibility and general release when such costs are material 
as of december  and  we had no capitalized internal development costs for computer software developed for resale 
we did not capitalize any internal web site development costs during or since the costs related to planning or operation of such products and sites 
the costs incurred with respect to our internet based learning products and web sites were incurred prior to the adoption of eitf no 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets we account for goodwill and intangibles and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as discussed further in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted both sfas nos 
and effective january  we measure for impairment at the reporting unit level using a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units 
our discounted cash flow model contains significant assumptions and accounting estimates about discount rates  future cash flows and terminal values that could materially affect our operating results or financial position if they were to change significantly in the future 
we perform our goodwill impairment test whenever events or changes in facts or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist and also during the fourth quarter each year 
in connection with our adoption of sfas no 
 we completed a transitional goodwill impairment evaluation 
as a result of this evaluation  we recognized a transitional impairment loss of million 
this impairment evaluation included significant assumptions and accounting estimates as described above 
through december   we accounted for goodwill and intangibles in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  statement

this review included estimates of future cash flows related to such long lived assets 
as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded charges of approximately  and  related to impairments of long lived assets during the years ended december  and  respectively 
strategic alliances effective october   we entered into a new four year agreement with hca information technology services  inc hca  replacing the prior agreement with columbia information systems  inc that had approximately two and one half years remaining 
together with hca  we mutually agreed to cancel the warrant held by cis holdings  inc  an affiliate of hca  to purchase our common stock 
as a result  we are no longer amortizing the remaining cost of the warrant as a reduction of revenues 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
revenues from april  through september  provided under the prior service agreement that included the grant of the warrant to cis holdings  inc  were recognized as services were rendered  net of the amortization of the fair value of the related warrant as a reduction of the revenues proportionately over the term of the four year agreement 
in february  we entered into a five year agreement with webmd corporation  formerly healtheon webmd webmd 
the agreement provided that we would be the exclusive provider of education  continuing education and training services for all healthcare organizations  healthcare professionals and healthcare workers on all web sites owned or operated by webmd in exchange for certain guaranteed payments

as a result of these acquisitions and other acquisitions consummated prior to  we had recorded goodwill of million and million of other acquisition intangibles at december  goodwill and intangibles  net of accumulated amortization totaled approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively  and represented and of total assets and and of total shareholders equity at december  and  respectively 
our weighted average amortization period is years 
in addition to the impact of estimates on the ongoing evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  significant estimates were involved in recording the above acquisitions using the fair value methodology provided for under the purchase method of accounting 
such estimates impacted the values assigned to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed as well as establishment of the estimated useful lives of the related tangible and intangible assets 
in addition to the accounting policies and significant estimates discussed above  additional estimates are required in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting estimates not discussed above include estimates related to our allowance for doubtful accounts and product development 
as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements  we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts using a specific identification method based on the facts and circumstances at each evaluation date as well as providing for an additional allowance for accounts not specifically identified as potentially uncollectible 
in connection with product development  our significant estimates involve the assessment of technological feasibility for new products  as well as the expected useful life of costs associated with new products and content 
once capitalized  product and content development costs are subject to the policies and estimates described above regarding goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 

table of contents to date  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technologies  create  license and acquire our content  build brand awareness  develop our infrastructure and expand our business  and have yet to achieve sufficient revenues to generate positive operating cash flows 
as a result  we have incurred operating losses in each fiscal quarter since we expect operating losses to continue through as we continue to expand our business and develop and sell new products and services 
these costs could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or operating results 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results prior to january  are not necessarily meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as an indication of our future performance 
results of operations revenues and expense components the following descriptions of the components of revenues and expenses apply to the comparison of results of operations 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we began producing discrete financial information under two reportable segments during  hco and pmd 
as a result of this change  we have provided comparative financial data for these segments for and and have provided comparative information to the extent such information was prepared 
revenues 
revenues for our hco business unit currently consist of the provision of services through our internet based learning products  the licensing of our installed learning management products  maintenance and support services  content subscriptions and online development 
revenues for our pmd business unit consist of online and live event development  coordination and registration services  online products and commercial support  sale of online enduring products and training services  and web cast events

product development 
product development expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  third party content acquisition costs  costs associated with the development of content and expenditures associated with maintaining  developing and operating our web sites and training delivery and administration platform 
in addition  product development expenses are associated with the development of new products 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and employee benefits  advertising  promotions  and related marketing costs 
other general and administrative expenses 
other general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  facility costs and fees for professional services 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization consist of fixed asset depreciation  amortization of intangibles considered to have definite lives  and amortization of content  license fees  and royalties paid to content providers that are of a fixed nature 
other income expense 
the primary component of other income is interest income related to interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
the primary component of other expense is interest expense related to capital leases  other long term obligations  debt and loans from related parties 
compared to revenues 
revenues increased approximately million  or  to million for from approximately million for revenues for consisted of million for our hco unit and million for our pmd unit 
in  revenues consisted of million for our hco unit and million for our pmd unit 
the increase in hco revenues over related primarily to growth in our internet based learning network  increased content subscriptions and the cancellation of a warrant to purchase our common stock previously held by hca  which eliminated the amortization of the warrant value previously recognized as a reduction of revenues for the first nine months of hco revenues through september are presented net of warrant expense of approximately million 
pmd revenue increases resulted primarily from live event services 
during the components of hco revenues changed compared to  as subscription revenues from our internet based learning products increased by approximately million  while elimination of the warrant resulted in another million of the increase 
the increase in subscription revenues from our internet based learning products is attributable to the growth in our internet based learning network  which was comprised of approximately  activated subscribers as of december   and as a result of delivering additional content to those subscribers 
these hco revenue increases were offset by declines in revenues of approximately million from sales of licenses and maintenance fees associated with our installed learning management products  which is consistent 
table of contents with our strategy to transition these customers to our internet based learning products 
we anticipate continuation of these trends in during  pmd revenues increased over primarily due to approximately  of growth in live event development and coordination services 
these increases were partially offset by declines of  in online development services and web cast revenues 
the increase in live event development and coordination services resulted from both providing additional services to existing customers as well as sales to new customers 
we expect pmd revenues to increase as well during due to increased penetration of existing customer relationships as well as sales to new customers 
consistent with the trends noted during  we anticipate reduced revenues derived from online development services and no significant revenues from our web cast product during during  of revenues related to our internet based learning products  related to live event development and coordination services  related to maintenance and support fees for our installed learning management products  related to online development services  related to our installed learning management product licensing fees and related to web casts 
during  of revenues related to live event development coordination  and registration services  related to maintenance and support fees for our installed learning management products  related to our internet based learning products  related to other transactions and product sales including commercial support  related to online development services  related to our installed learning management product licensing fees  and related to web casts 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased approximately  or  to million for from approximately million for the increase resulted primarily from additional costs associated with increased expenses related to live event development and coordination services  such as personnel expenses  travel and contract labor 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased from for to for this decrease as a percentage of revenues resulted from the change in revenue composition discussed above 
cost of revenues for our hco unit decreased approximately  from million in to million in  and approximated and of revenues for and  respectively 
the decrease as a percentage of revenues for our hco unit is a result of changes in revenue components  discussed above  and decreases in personnel expenses  travel  contract labor  and hosting fees 
we expect that the cost of revenues for the hco unit will increase during  but decrease as a percentage of revenues as revenues from the internet based learning products are expected to increase 
cost of revenues for the pmd unit increased approximately  from million in to million in  and approximated and of revenues for and  respectively 
this percentage increased in due to additional personnel expenses and other direct costs associated with our live event development and coordination services and the redesignation of certain personnel and other direct costs associated with online development and content services as costs of revenues in  which were previously designated as product development costs in we expect cost of revenues for the pmd unit to decrease as a percentage of revenues during as a result of growth in revenues associated with higher margin products 
cost of revenues for our unallocated corporate functions increased approximately  to  in from  in this increase is a result of combining customer service and site operation efforts into our corporate function
