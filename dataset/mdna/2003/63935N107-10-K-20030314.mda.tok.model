table of contents business risks in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form k and in the documents incorporated by reference herein  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
such factors could have a significant impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company relies heavily on its consulting staff and management team 
the company s inability to retain highly skilled professionals  coupled with departures of a significant number of senior employees  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s common stock price may fall and any investment in the company may be materially affected 
any long term decline in the common stock would impair the company s ability to use equity based compensation to attract  retain and motivate key employees 
the company uses equity based compensation as a portion of senior and mid level consultants overall compensation package 
equity based compensation is being used to help align the interests of its employees and stockholders  but complete alignment is difficult to achieve 
compensation and retention related issues represent a continuing challenge for the company 
specialized systems and processes have been developed by the company and provide a competitive advantage in servicing current clients and obtaining new clients 
this intellectual capital is the property of navigant consulting  inc and the unauthorized use could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business 
additionally  many of the company s service offerings rely on technology that is subject to rapid change 
the company s intellectual capital in certain service offering may be rendered obsolete due to new governmental regulation 
a new governmental regulation could allow a competitor a significant advantage before the company is able to adapt to new updated service demands 
the company must manage growth from both organically expanding services and the acquisitions of complementary consulting firms 
this growth and integration of acquisitions may cause strain on our management team and our systems 
the strain on management from rapid growth or unsuccessful integration of these businesses could have a material adverse effect on the future profitability of the company 
the company s return of capital may not materialize on certain business acquisitions 
the company also may pay a substantial premium on certain business acquisitions to remain competitive 
the financing of these acquisitions through cash or common stock could impair liquidity or cause significant stock dilution 
the company s engagements are usually relatively short term in comparison to its office related expenses and other infrastructure commitments 
the company s inability to continually replace a significant portion of its current engagements would have an adverse effect on the company s ability to meet its current and future commitments 
the company maintains a revolving line of credit agreement to help fund short term and long term cash requirements from normal operations 
this agreement contains certain covenants requiring  among other things  a minimum level of earnings 
poor performance of the company could cause the company to be in default of these existing covenants 
additionally  the company cannot be certain that it will be able to raise capital or obtain debt financing to execute future acquisitions or to meet required working capital needs 

table of contents if the financial condition of the company s clients were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances for uncollectability would likely be required

any factors that damage our professional reputation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company is subject to the risk of professional liability 
the company s consultants engage in complex analyses in which the exercise of professional judgment is critical

a claim against the company could exceed the limits of the company s insurance coverage and could damage the company s reputation 
legislative changes affecting our clients  our competitors  or our staff could have an impact on business 
an example of this is the sarbanes oxley act of  which limits the services that public accounting firms are permitted to provide to their audit clients 
the company is not a public accounting firm and therefore is not subject to such restrictions 
changes to the sarbanes oxley act or rules promulgated thereunder  as well as other legislation could have an impact on the company s business

overview the company is a specialized  independent consulting firm providing litigation  financial  restructuring  strategic and operational consulting services to government agencies  legal counsel  and large companies facing the challenges of uncertainty  risk and distress

over the last three years  a substantial majority of the company s revenues have been generated under hourly or daily rates billed on a time and expense basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis  with revenue recognized as the services are provided 
from time to time  the company earns incremental revenues  in addition to hourly or fixed fee billing  which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual objectives  typically related to the closing of a sale of a client s assets 
such incremental revenues are commonly referred to as success fees  they may cause significant variations in quarterly revenues and operating results if all other revenues and expenses during the quarters remain the same

critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition policies the company recognizes revenues as the related professional services are provided

from time to time  the company also earns incremental revenues  commonly referred to as success fees  such as based on the successful closing of the sale of a client s assets 
these success fees amounts are generally contingent on a specific event  after which revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion method 
determinations of accounts receivable realization the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on the company s review and assessment of its clients ability to make required payments  and the estimated realization  in cash  by the company of amounts due from its clients 
if the financial condition of a client were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of the client s ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
valuation of net deferred tax assets the company has recorded net deferred tax assets as it expects to realize future tax benefits related to the utilization of these assets 
although the company has experienced net losses in recent years prior to  no valuation allowance has been recorded related to these deferred tax assets because management believes that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the future tax benefits 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  it would need to establish an allowance which would be recorded as a charge to income in the period in which such determination is made
