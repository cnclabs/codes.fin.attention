item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general realty income corporation  the monthly dividend company r  a maryland corporation realty income  the company  our or we was organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust reit 
the company s primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations ffo per share 
over the past years  realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under long term primarily to year lease agreements 
the monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from  retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains 
we also seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties 
at december   we owned a diversified portfolio o of  retail properties  o with an occupancy rate of  or  properties occupied of the  properties in the portfolio  o leased to different retail chains  o doing business in separate retail industries  o located in states  o with approximately million square feet of leasable space  and o with an average leasable retail space of  square feet 
of the  properties in the portfolio   or  are single tenant retail properties with the remaining five being multi tenant properties 
as of december    or  of the  single tenant properties were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension options of approximately years 
in addition to our real estate portfolio  at december  our subsidiary  crest net lease  inc crest net had invested million in a portfolio of four retail properties located in three states 
these properties are held for sale 
liquidity and capital resources cash reserves 
realty income is organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders  in the form of monthly cash distributions  a substantial portion of its net cash flow generated from leases on its retail properties 
we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we intend  however  to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay our credit facility 
new million bank credit facility 
in october  we entered into a new million credit facility to replace our existing million acquisition credit facility and our million credit facility  each of which was scheduled to expire during under the terms of the new credit facility  total funds available were increased by million 
concurrent with the closing of the new facility  our previous credit facilities were canceled 
at march   the million credit facility had an outstanding balance of million 
the borrowing rate on the new credit facility was reduced compared to the previous credit facilities 
realty income s current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at libor london interbank offered rate plus basis points with a facility fee of basis points  for all in drawn pricing of basis points over libor  as compared to an all in pricing of basis points on our previous credit facilities 
the term of the new facility extends through october the co lead arranger and sole administrative agent for the credit facility is wells fargo bank  na  with the bank of new york acting as co lead arranger and sole documentation agent 
they are joined by the bank of america  na and wachovia bank  national association as co syndication agents 
five other banks are also participants in providing the credit facility amsouth bank  bank of montreal  us bank national association  bank one  na and chevy chase bank  fsb 
this credit facility is expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties leased to national and regional retail chains under long term lease agreements 
any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 
we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 
universal shelf registration of million 
in december  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec covering up to million in value of common stock  preferred stock and debt securities 
this registration statement was declared effective by the sec in january through march   we have not issued any common stock  preferred stock or debt securities under the universal shelf registration statement 
issuances of common stock in in july  we issued  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of million were used to repay borrowings under our million acquisition credit facility 
in february  we issued  shares of common stock to a unit investment trust at a net price to us of per share  based on a discount to the market price at the time of issuance of per share 
the net proceeds of million were used to repay bank borrowings under our million acquisition credit facility 
conservative capital structure 
we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure 
therefore  we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
at march   our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were million or approximately of our total market capitalization of billion 
we define our total market capitalization as the sum of the o shares of our common stock outstanding multiplied by the last reported sales price of the common stock on the nyse on march  of per share  o liquidation value of the class b preferred stock  o liquidation value of the class c preferred stock  and o outstanding borrowings on the credit facility and outstanding notes at march  historically  we have met our long term capital needs through the issuance of common stock  preferred stock and long term unsecured notes 
over the long term  we believe that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the form of common stock  however  we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time 
we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties 
in addition  we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities 
however  we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us 
credit agency ratings 
we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings  on our senior unsecured notes  from fitch ratings  moody s investor service  inc and standard poor s rating group 
currently  fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb  moody s has assigned a rating of baa and standard poor s has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes 
these ratings could change based upon  among other things  our results of operations and financial condition 
we also have received credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our preferred stock 
fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb  moody s investor service  inc has assigned a rating of baa and standard poor s rating group has assigned a rating of bb 
these ratings could change based upon  among other things  our results of operations and financial condition 
notes outstanding 
in january  we issued million of senior notes due the notes 
interest on the notes is payable semiannually 
in october  we issued million of monthly income senior notes due the notes 
interest on the notes is payable monthly 
in may  we issued million of senior notes due the notes 
interest on the notes is payable semiannually 
all of these notes contain various covenants  including i a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause the company s debt to total assets ratio to exceed  ii a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause the company s secured debt to total assets ratio to exceed  iii a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause the company s debt service coverage ratio to be less than times  and iv the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than of the company s outstanding unsecured debt 
the company has been in compliance with all of these note covenants since each of the notes were issued 
no unconsolidated investments 
realty income and its subsidiaries have no unconsolidated investments in special purpose entities  variable interest entities  or off balance sheet financing  nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments 
property acquisitions 
in  we acquired properties the new properties located in states and invested million in the new properties and properties under development  which includes investments of million for properties acquired before we have committed to pay estimated unfunded development costs of million on properties under construction at december  in  we capitalized  for re leasing costs and  for building improvements on existing properties in our portfolio 
the initial weighted average annual unleveraged return on the million invested in is estimated to be  computed as estimated contractual net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the base rent or  in the case of properties under construction  the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease  divided by the estimated total costs 
since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent  we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentage listed above 
the new properties are expected to contain approximately  leasable square feet and are leased under net leases  with an average initial lease term of years 
at december   six of the new properties were leased and under construction  pursuant to contracts under which the tenants agreed to develop the properties with development costs funded by realty income  with rent scheduled to begin during in  we acquired properties the properties and invested million in the properties and properties under development 
in  we also paid  for re leasing costs and  for building improvements on existing properties in our portfolio 
the initial weighted average annual unleveraged return on the million invested in is estimated to be  computed in the same manner as s estimated initial weighted average annual unleveraged return and subject to the same possible outcome described above 
these properties contain approximately  leasable square feet and are leased under net leases  with an average initial lease term of years

we pay monthly cash distributions to our common stockholders 
we paid aggregate distributions to our common stockholders of million in  million in and million in we pay quarterly cash distributions to our class b preferred stockholders 
we paid aggregate distributions to our class b preferred stockholders of million in each of  and we pay monthly cash distributions to our class c preferred stockholders

we formed crest net in january to purchase  own and sell properties  primarily to buyers using tax deferred exchanges under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
realty income owns of crest net s stock 
the financial statements of crest net are consolidated into realty income s financial statements 
all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
in  crest net invested million in three retail properties 
these three properties are expected to contain approximately  leasable square feet  are leased and have initial lease terms averaging years 
two of these properties were sold in in  crest net invested million in retail properties 
these properties contain approximately  leasable square feet  are leased and have initial lease terms averaging years 
twenty three of these properties were sold during and in  crest net sold properties from its inventory for million and realty income recorded a gain of million  before income taxes 
at the end of  crest net carried an inventory of million  which is included on realty income s consolidated balance sheet in real estate held for sale  net 
in  crest net generated million in funds from operations for realty income 
the contribution  if any  to our ffo by crest net will depend on the timing and the number of property sales achieved by crest net  if any  in a given year 
in  crest net sold nine properties from its inventory for million and we recorded a gain of million  before income taxes 
in  crest net generated million in funds from operations for realty income 
stock and senior debt purchase program 
in january  our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million of our outstanding common and preferred shares and senior debt securities 
from time to time since january  we concluded our share price justified purchasing shares since this provided an attractive return on our investment capital 
we purchased an aggregate of million of our securities since january we did not purchase any of our securities in funds from operations ffo ffo for increased by million  or  to million versus million in ffo in was million 
the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable generally accepted accounting principles gaap measure to ffo and information regarding distributions paid and the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for  and dollars in thousands net income available to common stockholders    depreciation and amortization continuing operations    discontinued operations depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment provision for impairment losses continuing operations  discontinued operations  gain on sales of investment properties continuing operations   discontinued operations  total funds from operations    distributions paid to common stockholders    ffo in excess of distributions to common stockholders    diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding    we define ffo  a non gaap measure  consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust s definition  as net income available to common stockholders  plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry  reduced by gains and increased by losses on i sales of investment property and provisions for impairment and ii extraordinary items 
adjusted funds from operations affo we utilize affo as a non gaap measure of our cash available for distributions to our common stockholders 
most companies in our industry use a similar measurement  but they may use the term cad for cash available for distribution or fad for funds available for distribution 
we define affo as funds from operations i plus certain non cash items including amortization of treasury lock settlements  note financing costs and stock compensation  ii minus capitalized expenditures on existing properties in our portfolio such as capitalized re leasing costs and commissions and capitalized building improvements  and iii plus or minus straight line rent which is non cash rental revenue 
affo for increased by million  or  to million versus million in affo in was million

no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 
our straight line rent exceeded our actual cash rent collected by the amounts indicated in each of the years presented 
we consider ffo and affo to be appropriate non gaap measures of the performance of equity reits 
financial analysts use ffo and affo in evaluating reits 
ffo and affo can be a way to measure a reit s ability to make cash distribution payments 
presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the performance of different reits  although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and affo the same way  therefore  comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful 
ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of realty income s performance 
in addition  ffo and affo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity  of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments

those assumptions and estimates are the basis for certain of our accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  are considered to be critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainties inherent in making assumptions and estimates regarding unknown future outcomes  events may result in significant differences between our estimates and actual results 
management believes that each of our assumptions and estimates are appropriate under the circumstances and represent the most likely outcome 
we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to depreciable lives of our real estate assets and recoverability impairment of our real estate assets 
the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the year ended december  to the year ended december  rental revenue was million for versus million for  an increase of million  or 
the increase in rental revenue is attributable to o the properties acquired in  which generated revenue of million  o the properties acquired in  which generated revenue of million in compared to million in  an increase of million  o properties owned by crest net  which generated revenue of million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  o properties sold during and  which generated rental revenue of  in as compared to million in  a decrease of million excluding rental revenue included in discontinued operations  o development properties acquired before that started paying rent in  properties that were vacant during part of or  straight line rent and lease termination settlements that generated revenue of million in as compared to million in  an increase of million  and o same store rents generated on leased properties owned in all of both and increased by million  or  to million from million 
of the  properties in the portfolio at december    or  are single tenant properties with the remaining properties being multi tenant properties 
of the  single tenant properties   or  were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension options of approximately years at december  of our  leased single tenant properties   or  were under leases that provide for increases in rents through o base rent increases tied to a consumer price index with adjustment ceilings  o overage rent based on a percentage of the tenants gross sales  o fixed increases  or o a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions 
percentage rent  which is included in rental revenue  was million in and million in our portfolio of retail real estate  owned under net leases  continues to perform well and provide dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends 
at december   our property portfolio consisting of  retail properties  was leased with only properties available for lease 
transactions to lease or sell of the properties available for lease or sale at december  were underway or completed as of march  we anticipate these transactions to be completed during the next six months  although we cannot guarantee that all of these properties can be sold or leased within this period 
it has been our experience that approximately to of our property portfolio will be available for lease at any given time  however  we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed these levels 
gain on sales of real estate acquired for resale 
in  crest net sold properties for million and realty income recognized a gain on the sales of million  before income taxes 
in  crest net sold nine properties for million and realty income recognized a gain on the sales of million  before income taxes 
at december   crest net had million invested in four properties  which are held for sale 
it is crest net s intent to carry an average inventory of between million to million in real estate 
we anticipate crest net s level of inventory increasing during crest net generates an earnings spread on the difference between the lease payments it receives and the cost of capital used to acquire its properties 
this earnings spread on crest net s inventory covers the ongoing operating expenses of crest net

interest coverage ratio 
our interest rate coverage for was times and for was times 
interest coverage ratio is calculated as ebitda divided by interest expense 
ebitda is calculated as follows net income plus interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and impairment losses less gain on sales of investment properties 
our ebitda for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap performance measures 
our calculation of ebitda may be different from the calculation used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be limited

our fixed coverage ratio for was times and for was times 
fixed coverage ratio is calculated as follows ebitda divided by the sum of interest expense and preferred stock dividends 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to gaap performance measures 
depreciation and amortization was million in versus million in the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the acquisition of properties in and  which was offset by property sales in and depreciation of buildings and improvements is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
if we used a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we believe that years is an appropriate estimate of useful life 
no depreciation has been recorded on crest net s properties because they are held for sale 
amortization expense related to goodwill for was  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  our goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  a provision for impairment will be recorded to reduce the carrying value to its fair value 
during the second quarter of  we completed the transitional impairment testing of our goodwill and found that our goodwill was not impaired 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in versus million in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to in as compared to in included in general and administrative expenses are  and  of expenses attributable to crest net in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses  excluding expenses attributable to crest net  increased primarily due to increases in corporate insurance  payroll costs and staffing 
we had employees at march  compared to employees at march  property expenses are broken down into costs associated with non net leased multi tenant properties  unleased single tenant properties and general portfolio expenses 
expenses related to the multi tenant and unleased single tenant properties include  but are not limited to  property taxes  maintenance  insurance  utilities  property inspections  bad debt expense and legal fees 
general portfolio costs include  but are not limited to  insurance  legal  property inspections and title search fees 
at december   properties were available for lease  as compared to at december  property expenses were million in and million in the  increase in property expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in portfolio property insurance and costs associated with properties available for lease 
other expenses were million in and million in the following is a summary of our other expenses in and dollars in thousands net change realty income state and local income taxes crest net income taxes   other expenses   a provision for impairment loss of million was recorded in  and is included in discontinued operations 
a provision for impairment loss of million was recorded in we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
generally  a provision is made for impairment loss if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet 
if events should occur that required us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment losses  it could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
gain on sales of investment properties 
in  we sold or exchanged properties for a total of million and recognized a gain of million 
of this gain  million is included in income from discontinued operations 
in  we sold properties for a total of million and recognized a gain of million 
the gain recognized from property sales in was million less than the gain recognized from property sales in income from discontinued operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
effective january   statement no 
superseded statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
statement no 
requires long lived assets to be disposed of to be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell on our balance sheet 
it also broadened the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
statement no 
states that a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that clearly can be distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
in accordance with statement no 
 we report each individual property as a reporting component for determining discontinued operations 
four properties listed as held for sale at december   plus properties sold during were reported as discontinued operations

additionally  we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified 
we anticipate we will receive between million and million in proceeds from the sale of investment properties during the next months 
we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions

we paid preferred stock dividends of million in both and net income available to common stockholders in increased by million to million versus million in impact of inflation tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants sales volumes  increases in the consumer price index  and or fixed increases 
we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time 
during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent  as provided for in the leases  rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 
approximately  or  of the  properties in the portfolio are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property costs and expenses 
these lease features reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation 
inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed their increases in revenue 
impact of accounting pronouncements a 
in november  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting and disclosure for guarantees 
fin no 
addresses certain guarantees and the initial recognition  measurement and disclosure at inception of the guarantee 
the impact of adopting fin no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
b 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of certain variable interest entities 
fin no 
requires consolidation of a variable interest entity by an enterprise that holds a controlling financial interest 
the impact of adopting fin no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and long term notes used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives we issue long term notes  primarily at fixed rates  and may selectively enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate lock agreements  interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december  we do not enter into any transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in table in millions expected maturity data thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate the credit facility expires in october million matures in may million matures in october and million matures in january we base the fair value of the fixed rate debt at december  on the closing market price or indicative price per each note 
the fair value of the variable rate debt approximates its carrying value because its terms are similar to those available in the market place 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss  with respect to interest rate fluctuations  would depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at the time  and interest rates
