some of our wholesalers and distributors purchase products that are warehoused for drug chains  independent pharmacies  state and federal governmental agencies and managed healthcare organizations 
sales are recognized when the product is shipped and appropriate provisions are made for returns 
consistent with industry practice  we have a returned goods policy which is described in business  above

cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at june  were million as compared to  at december   an increase of million 
this increase is primarily attributable to the proceeds from the sale of atec computer operations  interpharm  inc s cash flow from operating activities and net bank borrowings of  offsetting these events were equipment purchases of  during the six month period ending june  we believe that one of the most important factors in our ability to continue to grow our business will be our ability to launch new products

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that interpharm make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  interpharm evaluates judgments and estimates made  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  income taxes and contingencies including litigation 
interpharm bases its judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing its financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition revenues from the sale of interpharm products are recognized upon shipment of the product 
revenues are recorded net of provisions for rebates  charge backs  discounts and returns  which are established at the time of sale 
estimates for rebates  charge backs  and discounts are calculated based on actual experience and also cover chargebacks on sales to intermediary wholesale prime vendors for the supply of ibuprofen to the department of veterans affairs 
we purchase raw materials from a supplier  which is then used in the manufacturing of completed goods and sold back to the supplier  by direct drop shipment to the supplier s customers 
the raw materials are also used in the manufacturing of products for other customers 
we also i have the general inventory risk by taking title to all of the raw material purchased  ii establish the selling price for the finished product and  iii significantly change the raw materials into the finished product under our specifications and formulas 
these factors among others  qualify us as the principal under the indicators set forth in eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal vs 
net as an agent 
if the terms and substance of the arrangement change  such that we no longer qualify to report these transactions on a gross reporting basis  our net income and cash flows would not be affected 
however  our sales and cost of sales would both be reduced by a similar amount 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for doubtful accounts based upon customer specific analysis and assessment of past due balances 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is an increase in past due balances or for customer specific circumstances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at june  and december  and inventory our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined on a first in  first out basis  and include the cost of raw materials and manufacturing 
we continually evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when factors such as expiration dates and spoilage indicate that impairment has occurred  either a reserve is established against the inventories carrying value or the inventories are disposed of and completely written off in the period incurred 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires a company  at the time it issues a guarantee  to recognize an initial liability for the fair value of obligations assumed under the guarantee and elaborates on existing disclosure requirements related to guarantees and warranties 
the initial recognition requirements of fin are effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  and adoption of the disclosure requirements are effective for interpharm in the december  financial statements 
we do not expect the adoption the initial recognition requirements to fin will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective for the first interim period beginning after june  this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability 
we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with the requirements of sfas no 
issue and uncertainties risk of product liability claims the testing  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products subject us to the risk of product liability claims 
we believe that we maintain an adequate amount of product liability insurance  but no assurance can be given that such insurance will cover all existing and future claims or that we will be able to maintain existing coverage or obtain additional coverage at reasonable rates 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risks we do not use any derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  fluctuations in commodity prices or other market risks  nor do we invest in speculative financial instruments 
borrowings under our lines of credit are indexed to the prime rate 
due to the nature of our borrowings and short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material risk exposure
