critical accounting policies the accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
significant accounting policies are discussed in footnote to the financial statements  item inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
as such  materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operation and financial position include revenue recognition revenue is recognized when merchandise is delivered to customers or  in the case of custom installation revenue  when the service has been performed 
for the company  net sales and operating revenues include items related to normal business operations  including the sale of goods to customers and custom installation revenue 
retail sales are recorded at the time of the sale to the customer 
customer installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete 
inventory inventory is the company s largest asset class  comprising over of the company s total assets 
the company s inventory consists of finished goods held for retail sale 
purchase based volume rebates are credited to inventory or cost of products sold  as appropriate 
the company assesses the market value of its inventory on a regular basis by reviewing  on an item by item basis  the realizable value of its inventory  net of anticipated selling costs 
if it is management s judgment that the selling price of an item must be lowered below its cost in order for it to be sold  then the carrying value of the related inventory is written down to realizable value 
a number of factors would be taken into consideration in assessing realizable value including the quantity on hand  historical sales  technological advances  the existence of a replacement product  and consumer demand and preferences 
depending on market conditions  the actual amount received on sale could differ from management s estimate 
long lived assets long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment  goodwill  and reorganization value are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we would recognize an impairment loss when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its value upon disposal are less than its carrying amount 
if our estimates regarding future undiscounted cash flows or useful lives were to change  we could be exposed to losses that are material in nature 
accrued expenses the company is constantly required to make estimates of future payments that will be made which relate to the current accounting period 
these estimates range from things such as accrued but unpaid wages and bonuses to estimates of pending litigation claims 
in establishing appropriate accruals  management must make judgments regarding the amount of the disbursement that will ultimately be incurred 
in making such assessments  management uses historical experience as well as any other special circumstances surrounding a particular item 
the actual amount paid could differ from management s estimate
