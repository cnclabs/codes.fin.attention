item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is engaged in the business of leasing and other financing of gaming equipment and remarketing previously leased gaming devices to casino operators 
the gaming equipment financed by the company consists mainly of slot machines  video gaming machines and other gaming devices 
in addition  the company finances furniture  fixtures and other gaming related equipment  including gaming tables and chairs  restaurant and hotel furniture  vehicles  security and surveillance equipment  computers and other office equipment 
the company believes it is currently the only independent leasing company licensed in the states of nevada  new jersey  california  colorado  illinois  indiana  iowa  minnesota  mississippi  new mexico and washington to provide this financing alternative 
in early the company received a nonrestricted gaming license to operate the gambler  now known as rocky s casino and sports bar  in reno  nevada 
strategy the company s strategy is to increase recurring revenues and cash flows through originations of leases 
in addition to its leasing activities  the company also originates note transactions which it generally sells to third parties 
in some of its transactions  the company holds the leases or notes for a period of time after origination or retains a partial ownership interest in the leases or notes 
the company believes its ability to remarket used gaming devices enhances the gaming devices values at the end of an operating lease and facilitates additional financing transactions 
the following schedule shows the amount of leases and collateralized equipment loans financing transactions originated in thousands financing transactions originated and sold to third parties  financing transactions originated for the company s portfolio  accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures  some of which may require revision in future periods 
the most significant estimates are those involving residual values  collectibility of notes  accounts and leases receivable and valuation of equipment held for sale or lease 
the following is a summary of what management believes are the critical accounting policies related to the company 
the application of these policies  in some cases  requires the company s management to make subjective judgments regarding the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the company s consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item for a more detailed discussion of the company s accounting policies 
revenue and cost recognition 
the company records revenue  primarily  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  along with other related guidance under generally accepted accounting principles and other regulatory guidance related to revenue recognition applicable to its other business segments 
the company s leasing activities include operating  direct finance  sales type and leveraged leases 
for all types of leases  the determination of profit considers the estimated value of equipment at lease termination  referred to as the residual value 
the issues specific to operating  direct finance  sales type and leveraged leases are as follows for operating leases  revenue and depreciation on the leased equipment are recorded on the straight line method over the term of the lease 
direct finance and sales type leases are similar in that substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership of the leased equipment are transferred to the lessee  and finance income is recognized at a constant percentage return on the asset carrying value 
the carrying value consists of the present value of the future lease payments plus any unguaranteed residual  sometimes referred to herein as leases receivable 
a dealer s profit or loss on the subject equipment is recognized at the inception of a sales type lease 
investment in leveraged leases consists of rentals receivable net of principal and interest on nonrecourse debt  plus the estimated residual values of the equipment and minus unearned income that is recognized at a constant percentage return on the investment over the lease term 
after the inception of a lease  the company may discount or sell notes and future lease payments to reduce or recover its investment in the asset 
initial direct costs related to leases and notes receivable are capitalized as part of the related asset and amortized over the term of the agreement using the interest method  except for operating leases  for which the straight line method is used 
equipment held for sale or lease  consisting primarily of gaming devices  is valued at the lower of average unit cost or net realizable value 
revenue is recognized when title transfers to the customer upon shipment of used gaming devices or upon the exercise of a purchase option under an operating lease 
reserves for losses 
an allowance for losses is maintained at levels determined by the company s management to adequately provide for collection losses and any other than temporary declines in other asset values 
in determining losses  the company s management considers economic conditions  the activity in used equipment markets  the effect of actions by equipment manufacturers  the financial condition of customers  the expected courses of action by lessees with regard to leased equipment at termination of the initial lease term  changes in technology and other factors which management believes are relevant 
recoverability of an asset value is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if a loss is indicated  the loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the net realizable value of the asset 
asset charge offs are recorded upon the disposition of the underlying assets 
management reviews the company s assets on a quarterly basis to determine the adequacy of the allowances for losses 
results of operations during  and  the company had net income loss of   and  respectively  on revenues of million in  million in and million in the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors  including variations in the mix of financing transactions between operating leases  direct finance leases and notes receivable  changes in the gaming industry which affect the demand for remarketed gaming devices  economic conditions in which a detrimental change can cause customers to delay new investments or increase the company s bad debt experience and the level of fee income obtained through the sale of leases or financing transactions 
the company s quarterly operating results  including net income  have historically fluctuated due to the timing of completion of large financing transactions  as well as the timing of recognition of the resulting fee income upon subsequent sale 
and are no exception 
transactions  including individually significant ones  can be in the negotiation and documentation stages for several months  and recognition of the resulting revenue and fee income by the company may fluctuate greatly from quarter to quarter 
thus  the results of any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other period 
the following information is derived from the company s consolidated statements of net income loss appearing on page f of part iv  item  and is presented solely to facilitate the discussion of results of continuing operations that follows in thousands condensed consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  condensed consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  the effect on net income of changes between years the effect on net income of changes between years equipment sales and sales type leases gross margin   finance and lease gross margin     fee income       interest expense      casino gross margin selling  general and administrative    depreciation and amortization on other property collection and asset impairment provisions income loss from continuing operations before income taxes benefit and extraordinary item      equipment sales and sales type leases the table below summarizes the results of equipment sales and sales type leases years ended december  in thousands revenues sales type leases    equipment sales    sale of equipment at lease termination    cost of goods sold sales type leases   equipment sales    sale of equipment at lease termination    gross margin    the company realizes equipment sales and sales type lease gross margin when a lessee purchases leased equipment for which the company is paid cash or receives a promissory note reported as equipment sales revenue and that the company finances via a sales type lease reported as sales type leases revenue 
gains generally arise upon lease termination in two ways the company s operating lease agreements generally provide the lessee with the option to purchase the leased equipment upon lease expiration at its then fair market value 
the company realizes a gain when the lessee acquires the equipment for fair market value in excess of the company s residual carrying value  and an existing lessee chooses to terminate a lease prior to its scheduled expiration 
the lessee is generally required to pay the company an amount in excess of its carrying value in such situations 
revenue from equipment sales and sales type leases varies  in part  on a yearly basis as a result of lessees decisions about continued use of the equipment after lease end 
should a lessee decide to continue to use the equipment  the company will typically sell the equipment to the lessee for cash  for a promissory note  or under a sales type lease for a profit 
similarly  a lessee may choose to terminate a lease early and buy the equipment  usually resulting in a gain for the company 
therefore in originating leases  the company attempts to identify situations where the lessee would tend to keep the equipment beyond the lease period 
such situations increase the chance that the lessee will buy the equipment at the end of the lease term or terminate the lease early and buy the equipment 
revenue from equipment sales and sales type leases is also dependent  to a large extent  upon the number of leases maturing in a particular period  since a greater number of leases increases the number of opportunities to sell equipment to the lessee at a gain 
sales type lease revenue in reflects a higher number of sales type leases than in the most recent two years 
in  a large number of lessees early terminated leases and financed the acquisition of the equipment through a sales type lease 
in  one large finance lease was early terminated and the lessee purchased the equipment for cash 
the resulting transaction was reported as a sale of equipment at lease termination 
finance and lease gross margin finance and lease gross margin consists of the following in thousands years ended december  operating lease rentals    finance income    depreciation on operating leases    finance and lease gross margin declined in primarily as a result of non recurring income recognized in related to the workout and settlement of claims related to the company s then largest customer the customer 
equipment under operating leases  net was million and million at december  and  respectively 
notes and leases receivable amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the changes reflect the company s increased emphasis on originating a greater proportion of operating leases than notes and finance leases 
the company expects that it will continue to originate a greater proportion of operating leases to hold in its portfolio 
consequently  the portfolio of notes  accounts and leases receivable is expected to continue to decline in for notes and finance leases  finance income less interest cost associated with financing the underlying transaction is recognized as a constant percentage of the investment in the transaction over its life 
because the company s investment in the transaction declines as monthly payments are received  a greater proportion of the inherent transaction profit is recognized early in its life 
because the portfolio of notes and finance leases is declining in size as it  on average  matures  finance income less interest cost will continue to decline 
operating lease margin rent less depreciation is constant over the life of the lease 
however  because the interest cost associated with financing the operating lease is greater in the early term of the lease and declines as the lease matures  leasing margin  less interest cost  from an operating lease will be lower at the lease inception and increase over the life of the lease 
because the company has originated an increasing number of operating leases  leasing margin  less interest expense  has increased at a lesser rate than the increase in the size of the underlying operating lease portfolio 
this trend is expected to continue as the company continues to originate a greater amount of operating leases than notes and finance leases 
finance and lease gross margin increased from to  primarily due to finance income related to the customer and an increase in operating lease margin of million  or  from million in to million in the increase in operating lease gross margin is due to a larger portfolio in and our normal recurring portfolio review that resulted in acceleration of depreciation on certain leases in fee income fee income includes primarily commissions earned for arranging financing between unrelated parties and for financial advisory services 
fee income also includes gross profit from the sale to third parties of the company s interests in notes receivable and direct finance leases 
upon sale  the company records fee income equal to the difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the related asset 
fee income has historically fluctuated due to the timing of completion of large financing transactions  as well as the timing of the subsequent sale of notes receivable and direct finance leases 
fee income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
fee income in was higher than and  primarily because of fees earned for financial advisory services for the customer 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million in from million in due to lower levels of borrowings combined with generally lower interest rates 
interest expense increased in from million to million in due to higher levels of borrowings 
selling  general and administrative expenses the decrease of million in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to reflects increased capitalized overhead of  due to significantly higher originations in as compared to legal fees and settlement costs of  incurred in  but not in  in connection with the bankruptcy of the company s then most significant customer in and the resolution of a series of claims among the interested parties 
costs of  incurred in  but not in  associated with the senior subordinated debt exchange offer 
the increase of million in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to reflects increase in payroll and related costs of  from the expansion of the management team and additional administrative staff 
legal fees and settlement costs of  incurred in  but not in  in connection with the bankruptcy of the company s then most significant customer in and the resolution of a series of claims among the interested parties 
costs of  incurred in  but not in  associated with the senior subordinated debt exchange offer 
collection and asset impairment provisions the collection and asset impairment provisions represent the company s estimate of the amounts expected to be lost related to specific accounts  including estimated losses on future non cancelable lease rentals and notes receivable 
in  the provision reflects reserves for various uncollectible receivables 
in  provisions made for one significant customer in and were reversed as the financial condition of the customer improved significantly 
the receivables from this customer were collected in full in march the provision reflects one customer that defaulted under its financing agreements 
income taxes the company s effective tax benefit rate was approximately for the effective rate for is lower than the federal statutory rate of due primarily to miscellaneous costs that are non deductible for federal income tax purposes and therefore do not provide any tax benefit 
the company s effective tax rate was approximately for the effective rate for is higher than the federal statutory rate of due primarily to non deductible amortization of asset loan acquisition costs acquired through the issuance of warrants 
the company s effective tax benefit rate was approximately for  and is higher than the federal statutory rate of due primarily to non deductible amortization 
the company s deferred tax assets include net operating loss nol carryovers of approximately  which expire in the nol may also be carried back up to five years 
the nol is available to offset federal income tax liability 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents  and million in availability on lines of credit 
the funds necessary to support the company s activities have been provided by cash flows generated primarily from operating activities and various forms of recourse and non recourse borrowings from banks  financial institutions and financial intermediaries 
payments under the company s borrowings and the maturities of its borrowings are typically structured to match the payments under the leases and notes collateralizing the borrowings 
the company manages its portfolio to optimize concentration among customers or geographic markets 
to achieve this goal  it will from time to time sell or externally finance transactions originated  including those held in its investment portfolio 
the company continues to explore other possible sources of capital  however  there is no assurance that additional capital  if required  can be obtained or will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
on february   the company announced that it had entered into a letter of intent with respect to a proposal submitted by the management group to acquire all of the approximately of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock not already owned by the management group 
under the terms of the letter of intent  the company will pay certain fees and costs associated with the transaction  consisting primarily of legal costs and investment banking fees 
management estimates that such costs will be in the range of  to  with said costs being paid from general corporate funds 
the company prepares its balance sheet in an unclassified format  as is customary in its industry  because the working capital concept is not particularly meaningful for its business 
however  if the company did prepare a classified balance sheet  the components of working capital  with the changes therein  would be presented as shown in the following table 
the following table presents the components of consolidated working capital at december  and in thousands balance at december  change cash and cash equivalents   current portion of notes and lease receivables  net   current payments due from equipment under operating leases  equipment held for sale or lease    other current assets    total current assets    customer deposits    current portion of notes payable and subordinated debt   accounts payable and other accrued expenses    total current liabilities    net working capital deficit    cash flow net cash provided by continuing operating activities amounted to million in compared to million in net cash provided by continuing operating activities includes cash used for originating notes and direct finance leases  and cash provided by collections on notes and direct finance lease receivables and proceeds from sale or discounting of notes and leases receivable  as well as the collection of deposits on originated leases and notes receivable and the return to customers of deposits at maturity of a lease or note 
the higher level of cash provided by continuing operating activities in primarily reflects higher proceeds from those activities 
without considering those activities  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in  compared to approximately million in the decline reflects the company s operating losses for with respect to the company s discontinued operating activities  the company used net cash of million in and million in during the year ended december   the cash provided by investing activities was million compared to million of cash used for investing activities in this decrease in cash provided by investing activities is primarily a result of the sale of equipment in in  cash provided by financing activities was approximately million  and in  cash used in financing activities was approximately million 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities reflects the cash flow from the sale of equipment that was used to repay debt in see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item for a description of the company s debt financing 
the company s current financial resources  including estimated cash flows from future operations and the lines of credit which total approximately million of which million is available as of december   are expected to be sufficient to fund the company s anticipated working capital needs 
in addition to the borrowing activities described above  the company has developed a network of financial institutions from which it borrows money related to specific financial transactions and to which it sells financial transactions on a regular basis 
the company is also actively pursuing additional financing in the form of subordinated debt from a private placement  the proceeds of which would be secured by new finance originations 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in completing this financing 
inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december   the company s contractual cash obligations under its lines of credit  equipment notes  subordinated debt and operating leases for the next five years are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years after years lines of credit    equipment notes recourse equipment notes nonrecourse subordinated debt operating leases total      for additional information  see note  notes payable and subordinated debt  and note  commitments and contingencies  of the company s consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item forward looking statements certain statements contained herein constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements may be identified by the use of terminology such as believe  may  will  expect  anticipate  intend  designed  estimate  should or continue or the negatives thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology 
such forward looking statements involve known or unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the following strict regulation and changes in regulations imposed by gaming authorities  the limitation  conditioning  suspension or revocation of gaming licenses and entitlements held by the company  competition the company faces or may face in the future  the effects of the proposed going private transaction  uncertainty of market acceptance of the company s products and services  unproven performance of rocky s  a decline in the public acceptance of gaming  unfavorable public referendums or legislation  particularly as they relate to gaming  the ability of the company to continue to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms  the ability of the company to recover its investment in gaming equipment leased under operating leases as well as its investment in used gaming machines purchased for refurbishment and resale to customers  the risk of default by the company s customers with respect to its financing transactions  the company s dependence on key employees  potential fluctuations in the company s quarterly results  general economic and business conditions and other factors detailed from time to time in the company s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
cautionary statements as provided for under the private securities litigation reform act of  the company wishes to caution investors that the following important risk factors  among others  in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the company s actual results of operations and cause such results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements made in this document and elsewhere by or on behalf of the company 
effects of proposed going private transaction 
the proposed going private transaction announced on february  may cause substantial time commitments for the company s executive officers and directors 
should these matters distract management from the company s business  the company s operations could be adversely affected 
strict regulation by gaming authorities 
financing gaming equipment and remarketing gaming machines to casino operators in the united states are subject to strict regulation under various state  county and municipal laws 
the company and its required officers and certain shareholders have received the necessary licenses  permits and authorizations required to own and distribute gaming machines in nevada  new jersey  mississippi  california  colorado  iowa  indiana  illinois  new mexico  minnesota and washington 
additionally  the company has received its slot route operator s and operator s licenses in nevada 
failure of the company or any of its key personnel to obtain or maintain the requisite licenses  permits and authorizations would have a materially adverse effect on the company 
expansion of the company s activities may be hindered by delays in obtaining requisite state licenses or the inability to obtain such licenses 
no assurance can be given as to the term for which the company s licenses will be renewed in a particular jurisdiction or as to what license conditions  if any  may be imposed by such jurisdiction in connection with any future renewals 
the company cannot predict the effects that adoption of and changes in gaming laws  rules and regulations might have on its future operations 
competition 
in recent years  the company has focused primarily on providing financing to the gaming industry  including remarketing previously leased gaming machines to casino operators in the united states 
in the gaming equipment financing market  the company competes primarily with equipment manufacturers and to a lesser extent with leasing companies  commercial banks and other financial institutions 
certain of the company s competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than the company 
with regard to casino operations  gaming of all types is available throughout nevada  including many locations that compete directly or indirectly with rocky s in reno  nevada 
the operation of casinos is a highly competitive business 
in fact  reno  nevada casinos are anticipated to suffer greater competitive risks from a major native american owned casino complex scheduled to open in june near sacramento  california 
the principal competitive factors in the industry include the quality and location of the facility  the nature and quality of the amenities and customer services offered and the implementation and success of marketing programs 
significant competition encountered by the company may have a materially adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
demand for the company s products and services 
the company believes that its ability to increase revenues  cash flow and profitability will depend  in part  upon continued market acceptance of the company s products and services 
there can be no assurance that the market acceptance of the company s products and services will continue 
changes in market conditions in the gaming industry and in the financial condition of casino operators  such as consolidation within the industry or other factors  could limit or diminish market acceptance of these products and services 
historically  the company has experienced significant nonrecurring revenues in connection with its financing and sales of gaming equipment to casino operators 
the company has attracted new customers to replace these nonrecurring revenues 
insufficient market acceptance of the company s products and services or a decline in the public acceptance of gaming could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
continued availability of adequate financing 
the amount and number of financing transactions that can be originated by the company are directly dependent upon and limited by its ability to fund such transactions  either through the sale of such transactions to institutional investors or through the company s working capital  lines of credit and other financing sources 
in addition  the company desires to hold a greater volume of transactions  particularly leases  in its portfolio 
there is no assurance that the company s present funding sources will be willing to purchase future transactions  expand existing lines of credit  or continue to provide the company with a source of funds under acceptable terms 
further  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to locate new funding sources  if needed 
as a result  funding for the company s transactions may not be available on acceptable terms or on a timely basis  if at all 
the inability of the company to obtain suitable and timely funding for its transactions could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operations 
ability to recover investment in equipment 
the gaming equipment leased under operating leases by the company and the inventory of gaming devices represents a substantial portion of the company s capital 
under the operating leases  the company retains title to the gaming equipment and assumes the risk of not recovering its entire investment in the gaming equipment through either re leasing or selling the gaming equipment 
at the inception of each operating lease  the company estimates the residual value of the leased equipment  which is the estimated market value of the equipment at the end of the initial lease term 
the actual residual value realized may differ from the estimated residual value  resulting in a gain or loss when the leased equipment is sold or re leased at the end of the lease term 
the inability to re lease or sell the gaming equipment on favorable terms could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
risks relating to financing transactions 
the company has funded selected gaming equipment transactions entirely with its own working capital or with borrowed funds rather than immediately selling the transactions to institutional investors 
in certain situations  the company retains a portion of the transactions it originates 
this approach requires substantial capital and places the company at risk for its investment in the transactions  which may subject the company to greater loss in the event of a default by the lessee or borrower  or an inability to sell the transactions to institutional investors after a period of temporary investment by the company 
in connection with its financing transactions  the company s level of risk depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the lessee or borrower and the underlying collateral 
no assurance can be given that the company will not incur significant losses with respect to financing transactions in the future  or that such losses will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
risks relating to sovereign nation status of certain customers 
the company has provided  and may provide in the future  financing to native american tribes 
native american tribes in the united states generally enjoy sovereign immunity from lawsuits  similar to that of the united states government 
although the company generally obtains a waiver of sovereign immunity  there can be no assurance that a tribe will not assert sovereign immunity  even if such right has been waived 
the law regarding sovereign immunity is unsettled 
if any native american tribe defaults and successfully asserts its right of sovereign immunity  the company s ability to recover its investment and originate and sell future native american gaming transactions could be materially adversely affected 
dependence on current management 
the company s success is largely dependent on the efforts of johan p 
finley  its founder and chief executive officer 
although the company maintains million of key person life insurance and has an employment agreement with mr 
finley  the loss of mr 
finley s services could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
potential fluctuations in results 
the company s quarterly results have historically fluctuated due to the timing of completion of large financing transactions  as well as the timing of recognition of the resulting fee income upon the completion of brokered transactions 
thus  the results of any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
control by current management 
johan p 
finley  the company s founder and chief executive officer  owns approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
in addition  mr 
finley s wife and children own approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
thus  mr 
finley effectively controls the election of all members of the company s board of directors and determines all corporate actions 
such ownership may discourage acquisition of large blocks of the company s securities and may depress the price of the common stock and have an anti takeover effect 
anti takeover provisions  preferred stock 
the company s amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that no investor may become a holder of or more of the company s stock without first agreeing to consent to a background investigation  provide a financial statement and respond to questions from gaming regulators 
such ownership limitations may discourage acquisition of large blocks of the company s equity securities  may depress the price of the company s common stock and have an anti takeover effect 
the company s amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors to issue preferred stock and establish the rights and preferences of such shares without stockholder approval 
the voting rights of the preferred stock may be greater than the voting rights of common stock in certain circumstances  and thus the issuance of preferred stock may diminish the voting power of holders of common stock and make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company 
the company s directors are subject to investigation and review by gaming regulators in jurisdictions in which the company is licensed or has applied for a license 
such investigation and review of the company s directors may have an anti takeover effect 
as a minnesota corporation  the company is subject to certain anti takeover provisions of the minnesota business corporation act 
these provisions and the power to issue additional stock and to establish separate classes or series of stock may  in certain circumstances  deter or discourage takeover attempts and other changes in control of the company not approved by the board 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of the company s borrowings are under fixed interest rates  and maturities are matched with the cash flows of leased assets and notes receivables 
a changing interest rate environment will not significantly impact the company s margins since the effects of higher or lower borrowing costs would be reflected in the rates for newly originated leases or collateralized loans 
therefore  consistent with the company s strategy and intention to hold most of its originations to maturity  the company does not have a significant exposure to interest rate changes 
the company does not have a significant exposure to foreign currency risk because all of its sales to customers in foreign countries are transacted in united states dollars
