item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition general the following management s discussion and analysis describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  as well as the critical accounting policies  of fedex corporation also referred to as fedex 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited financial statements  which include additional information about our significant accounting policies  practices and the transactions that underlie our financial results 
fedex is one of the largest transportation companies in the world 
our business strategy is to offer a portfolio of transportation services through our independently operated business units 
these business units are primarily represented by our reportable operating segments fedex express  the world s largest express transportation company  fedex ground  north america s second largest provider of small package ground delivery service  and fedex freight  the largest us provider of regional less than truckload ltl freight services 
our diversified portfolio of services has allowed fedex to continue to generate revenue and earnings growth during challenging economic times 
the key factors that affect our operating results are the volumes of shipments transported through our networks  as measured by our average daily volume  the mix of services purchased by our customers  the prices we obtain for our services  as measured by average price per shipment yield  our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries  wages and benefits  fuel and maintenance  and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels 
except as otherwise specified  references to years indicate our fiscal year ended may  or ended may of the year referenced and comparisons are to the prior year 
results of operations consolidated results the following table compares revenues  operating income  operating margin  net income and diluted earnings per share dollars in millions  except per share amounts for the years ended may percent change revenues    operating income    operating margin net income diluted earnings per share results for include noncash charges of million for impairment of certain assets related to aircraft programs at fedex express and a million reorganization charge at fedex supply chain services 
these charges were million after tax or per diluted share 
see notes and to the accompanying audited financial statements 
results for reflect our adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we recognized an adjustment of million million or per share  net of tax to reduce the carrying value of certain goodwill to its implied fair value 
see note to the accompanying audited financial statements 
revenue growth during was attributable to the continued substantial growth of our fedex ground business  increased international volumes at fedex express and higher revenues at fedex freight 
increased us freight volumes at fedex express also contributed to consolidated revenue growth  as we benefited from a full twelve months of revenue under the transportation agreement with the us postal service usps  which commenced in late august during  revenue growth reflected a increase at fedex ground and increased us freight volumes from the usps agreement 
in  volume levels in our fedex express us domestic and international package services declined as a result of weakness in the us and global economies particularly in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors and the impact of the september  terrorist attacks 
operating income increased in as fedex ground improved its operating margin to  which more than offset a decline in the operating margin at fedex express 
the sluggish economy  combined with significant increases in pension and healthcare costs and higher maintenance expenses  reduced profitability at fedex express in despite continued cost control efforts 
variable compensation declined in based on below plan performance at fedex express 
during  operating income increased  largely due to the contributions of fedex ground and fedex freight  and the fact that included approximately million in noncash charges discussed below 
discretionary spending such as professional fees and travel related expenses stayed relatively flat in  as cost control remained a focus 
during  discretionary spending was approximately million lower 
pension costs were approximately million higher in on top of a million increase in  due principally to lower discount rates and decreased returns on pension plan assets 
although not required  we made additional contributions exceeding billion to our qualified us domestic pension plans during to ensure that our pension plan assets exceeded the related accumulated benefit obligations at our february  plan measurement date 
during  we implemented new indices for calculating fuel surcharges at fedex express and fedex ground  which more closely link the surcharges to prevailing market prices for jet and diesel fuel 
higher net fuel costs negatively affected operating income during  as fuel surcharge revenue increases did not keep pace with rising fuel prices 
although still negative for the year  the net impact of higher fuel prices on earnings was mitigated during the fourth quarter as fuel prices declined faster than the decrease in fuel surcharge revenue 
lower fuel prices during had a positive impact on operating expenses  however  declines in fuel surcharge revenue more than offset the impact of lower fuel prices on operating income 
we effectively closed jet fuel hedging contracts at the end of by entering into offsetting contracts 
the maturity of these contracts increased fuel costs by approximately million 
during  as a result of lower us domestic volumes at fedex express and lower capacity growth forecasts  we committed to eliminate certain excess aircraft capacity related to our md program which upgrades and modifies our older dc aircraft to make them more compatible with our newer md aircraft 
by curtailing the md program  we eliminated significant future capital expenditures through during  we also took actions to reorganize our fedex supply chain services subsidiary to eliminate certain unprofitable  non strategic logistics business and reduce its overhead 
in addition  due to the bankruptcy of ayres corporation  we wrote off deposits and related items in in connection with the ayres alm aircraft program 
following is a summary of these pretax charges in millions impairment of certain assets related to the md aircraft program strategic realignment of logistics subsidiary ayres program write off total results for were favorably affected by approximately million  related to the charges above  based on actual outcomes as compared to the original estimates 
no material amounts remained on our balance sheet for these items at the end of the performance of fedex ground and revenue growth from fedex freight east which was acquired in the third quarter of contributed to improved net income for and  but was mitigated by continued softness in us domestic package volumes at fedex express over the last two fiscal years 
results for also reflect the cessation of million of goodwill amortization  as required under the new accounting rules for goodwill adopted june   that would have been recorded in operating expenses 
goodwill amortization expense was million for other income and expense and income taxes net interest expense was lower in due to reduced borrowings 
in  net interest expense was slightly lower  as we utilized available cash to reduce debt balances during the year see financial condition 
in  other nonoperating expenses included losses of approximately million from the early retirement of debt assumed in the fedex freight east acquisition and the refinancing of certain capital lease obligations 
our effective tax rate was in  in and in the effective tax rate in was higher due to lower state taxes in the effective tax rate in was higher than the effective rate  primarily due to the utilization of excess foreign tax credits in the rate was favorably impacted by the cessation of goodwill amortization and by several other factors  none of which were individually significant 
the effective tax rate exceeds the statutory us federal tax rate primarily because of state income taxes 
for  we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 
the actual rate  however  will depend on a number of factors  including the amount and source of operating income 
airline stabilization compensation operations in were significantly affected by the terrorist attacks on september  during  we recognized a total of million of compensation under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the act  of which million has been received as of may  the amounts recognized were for our estimate of losses we incurred as a result of the mandatory grounding of our aircraft and for incremental losses incurred through december  all amounts recognized were reflected as reduction of operating expense under the caption airline stabilization compensation 
in the fourth quarter of  the department of transportation dot asserted that we were overpaid by million and has demanded repayment 
we have filed requests for administrative and judicial review of this determination 
we believe that we have complied with all aspects of the act  that it is probable we will ultimately collect the remaining million receivable and that we will not be required to pay any portion of the dot s million demand 
we cannot be assured of the ultimate outcome  however  it is reasonably possible that a material reduction to the million of compensation we have previously recognized under the act could occur 
cost savings initiatives on june   fedex express announced it will offer voluntary early retirement and severance programs during to continue resizing the fedex express us organization and improving profitability 
the first program will offer voluntary early retirement incentives  with enhanced pension and postretirement healthcare benefits  to certain groups of employees who are age or older 
the second program will offer voluntary severance incentives to eligible employees 
both programs are limited to eligible us salaried staff employees and managers at fedex express 
depending on employee acceptance rates  the pretax charge for these programs is estimated to be million to million in  with most of the charge to be incurred in the first half of the year 
approximately one third of the pretax charge will be cash 
the remainder of the costs relate primarily to pension and postretirement healthcare liabilities 
the cost of these programs will be reflected as a separate component of operating expenses 
the estimated savings from these programs are expected to be million to million in  primarily in the second half of the year 
thus  the net cost of these programs in is expected to be million to million 
in and beyond  the estimated annual savings from these programs are expected to be million to million 
the savings from these programs will be reflected primarily in lower ongoing salaries  wages and benefit costs 
over the past few years  we have taken many steps to bring our expense growth in line with revenue growth  particularly at fedex express  while maintaining our industry leading service levels 
we have significantly decreased capital expenditures by reducing aircraft orders  consolidating facilities and discontinuing low value programs 
the voluntary early retirement and severance programs are another step in this ongoing process of reducing our cost structure in order to increase our competitiveness  meet the future needs of our employees and provide the expected financial returns for our shareholders 
outlook during  we expect the us economy to remain sluggish at least through our first quarter  with year over year economic improvement expected to be evident in our second half results 
we believe the fundamentals for domestic economic acceleration in the us economy are in place  including supportive conditions in the overall financial markets  the recently approved tax stimulus package  continued accommodative monetary policy and improved consumer confidence 
our management teams are focusing on sizing our network for current economic conditions  improving our service offerings  enhancing the customer experience and positioning fedex to take full advantage of an economic recovery 
we continue to believe we are well positioned for long term growth when the economy  particularly the manufacturing and wholesale sectors  recovers and experiences sustained growth 
for  we anticipate revenue and volume growth in all segments if our expectations of a sustained economic recovery during the second half of are realized 
our revenue growth strategies will leverage our compete collectively philosophy 
fedex ground will continue its six year expansion plan and fedex freight will continue to enhance its portfolio of services 
increasing pension and healthcare expenses  as well as the net costs of our voluntary early retirement and severance programs  will negatively impact operating margins during we expect our net pension cost for will increase by approximately million based on a continued decline in interest rates  negative asset returns and a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets from to 
despite these increases in employee retirement costs  our retirement programs continue to be adequately funded with assets more than sufficient to meet our current obligations 
see further discussion in critical accounting policies 
during  we announced to our employees that the fedex corporation employees pension plan would be amended to add a cash balance feature  which we call the portable pension account 
eligible employees as of may  may make a one time election to accrue future pension benefits under either the new cash balance formula or the traditional pension benefit formula 
this election is entirely optional 
in either case  employees will retain all benefits previously accrued under the traditional pension benefit formula and will continue to receive the benefit of future salary increases on benefits accrued as of may  eligible employees hired after may  will participate in the portable pension account 
while this new program will provide employees greater flexibility and reduce our long term pension costs  it will not have a material effect on results 
we believe our long term growth strategy will provide improved profits from increases in shipping by high tech and high value added businesses and the globalization of the economy 
our long term corporate financial objectives are to increase cash flow and financial returns by improving our operating margin  principally at fedex express  and through continued growth at our fedex ground and fedex freight segments 
we plan to accomplish this goal by increasing volumes and by matching our cost structure and capital expenditures to expected business levels 
at fedex express  we expect operating margin improvement will require a return to consistent growth in those sectors of the us economy that most use domestic express air transportation 
margin growth will also depend on increasing volumes of heavier packages at higher yields and a rational pricing environment 
future results will depend upon a number of factors  including the timing  speed and magnitude of the us domestic economic recovery  the extent to which eligible employees participate in our voluntary early retirement and severance programs  the impact from any terrorist activities or international conflicts  our ability to match our cost structure and capacity with shifting volume levels and our ability to effectively leverage our new service and growth initiatives 
in addition  adjustments to our fuel surcharges lag changes in actual jet and diesel fuel prices paid 
therefore  our operating income could be materially affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or should we be unable to further increase our fuel surcharge in response to rising fuel prices due to competitive pressures 
although increased security requirements for air cargo carriers have been put in place and further measures may be forthcoming  as of yet we have no estimate of what impact any such measures may ultimately have on our results of operations 
see forward looking statements for a more complete discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance 
seasonality of business our express package and freight businesses are seasonal in nature 
historically  the us express package business experiences an increase in volumes in late november and december 
international business  particularly in the asia to us market  peaks in october and november due to us holiday sales 
our first and third fiscal quarters  because they are summer vacation and post winter holiday seasons  have historically exhibited lower volumes relative to other periods 
the transportation and logistics industry is affected directly by the state of the overall domestic and international economies 
seasonal fluctuations affect tonnage  revenues and earnings 
normally  the fall of each year is the busiest shipping period for fedex ground and fedex custom critical  while the latter part of december  january  june and july of each year are the slowest periods 
for fedex freight  the spring and fall of each year are the busiest shipping periods and the latter part of december  january and february of each year are the slowest periods 
shipment levels  operating costs and earnings for each of our operating companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather 
new accounting pronouncements a number of new accounting pronouncements were enacted during  mostly in connection with attempts to improve the transparency of financial reporting 
none of these new pronouncements had a material effect on our financial position or results of operations during see note to the accompanying audited financial statements for discussion of these recent accounting pronouncements 
reportable segments our reportable operating segments are fedex express  fedex ground and fedex freight  each of which operates in a single line of business 
included within other are the operations of fedex custom critical  fedex trade networks and fedex services 
other also includes certain unallocated corporate items and eliminations 
management evaluates segment financial performance based on operating income 
fedex services provides the customer facing sales  marketing and information technology functions  primarily for our fedex express and fedex ground reportable segments 
the costs for these activities are allocated based on metrics such as relative revenues and estimated services provided 
these allocations materially approximate the cost of providing these functions 
the line item intercompany charges on the accompanying financial summaries of our reportable segments includes the allocations from fedex services to fedex express  fedex ground and fedex freight  and certain other costs such as corporate management fees 
in addition  intercompany charges also includes allocated charges to our operating companies for management fees related to services received for general corporate oversight  executive officers and certain legal and finance functions 
we believe the total amounts allocated reasonably reflect the cost of providing such services

fedex express revenues fedex express total revenues increased in  largely due to increased ip and us freight revenues 
year over year revenue comparisons reflect the impact in of the terrorist attacks on september   which adversely affected both us outbound international shipments and us domestic shipments  and the economic decline that began in calendar higher us freight revenues from increased average daily pounds during also affected year over year revenue comparisons  as we benefited from a full twelve months of operations and higher shipping levels under our transportation contract with the usps 
during  total package revenue increased  due to increases in ip volumes and yield 
ip volume growth occurred predominantly in asia and europe  which experienced average daily volume growth rates of and  respectively  during in the united states  package revenue increased in due to higher yield and volumes in the us deferred and us overnight box categories 
total average daily package volumes for were at levels experienced in average daily volumes decreased during in virtually all package categories  resulting in a decrease in total package revenue 
while ip volumes decreased in  principally due to a decline in us outbound shipments  the european and asian markets positively impacted ip volumes 
for  fedex express experienced ip average daily volume growth rates of and in the european and asian markets  respectively 
yields at fedex express increased in in nearly all service categories and composite average weight per package was flat 
the increase in us domestic package yield during was due to higher fuel surcharge revenue and average list price increases 
for us domestic shipments and us outbound international shipments  an average list price increase of became effective january  ip yield improvements during were due to favorable exchange rate differences  increased fuel surcharge revenue and growth in higher yielding lanes 
package yields in were slightly lower in virtually all service categories due to a decrease in average weight per package and a decline in fuel surcharge revenue 
fuel surcharge revenue was higher in due to higher jet fuel prices and the introduction of a dynamic international fuel surcharge in september our fuel surcharge is based on the spot price for jet fuel 
during  fuel surcharge revenue was lower compared to because our dynamic index for determining our us domestic fuel surcharge was not implemented until the second quarter of using this index  the us domestic fuel surcharge ranged between and during and between and from november through may the fuel surcharge during all of was 
international fuel surcharges were as high as during total freight revenue for and increased significantly due to higher us freight volume and yield  reflecting the impact of the usps transportation agreement  which began in august and runs through august during  fedex express entered into a third addendum to the transportation agreement with the usps  allowing fedex express to continue carrying incremental pounds of mail through may  at higher committed volumes than required under the original agreement 
fedex express operating income during  the decrease in operating income and the decline in operating margin at fedex express was attributable to increased employee benefit costs  higher maintenance expenses and  to a lesser extent  the net impact of higher fuel costs in an economic environment of sluggish us domestic average daily package volumes 
the decrease in operating income was also somewhat attributable to one fewer operating day during the year 
operating results during were impacted by unusually inclement weather during the winter and spring  which decreased business shipping  reduced operational efficiency and increased certain operating costs  such as for snow removal and de icing 
in  operating income at fedex express decreased as package volume declines on a largely fixed cost structure more than offset continued cost management actions 
excluding million of asset impairment charges taken in  operating income was down in in  operating income decreases reflected charges related to the impairment of aircraft in the fourth quarter see consolidated results 
salaries  wages and benefits were higher during and due to wage rate increases and higher pension and healthcare costs 
also  the increase was partially the result of cost increases related to the usps contract 
incentive compensation provisions declined in and based on below plan performance 
fuel consumption was higher in and  primarily due to an increase in aircraft usage as a result of incremental us freight pounds transported under the usps agreement and ip volume growth 
during  fuel costs were higher  due to a increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel 
higher net fuel costs at fedex express negatively affected operating income during by million  as fuel surcharge revenue increases were not sufficient to offset higher jet fuel prices 
fuel costs were down during  due to a decrease in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel 
during  lower fuel surcharge revenue  net of the impact of lower fuel prices  negatively impacted operating income by million 
during  higher jet fuel prices negatively affected operating income by approximately million  including the results of jet fuel hedging contracts 
maintenance expenses were higher during  primarily due to the timing of scheduled maintenance events 
depreciation and amortization expense declined during reflecting a trend of decreasing levels of capital spending  as well as changes in estimated useful lives and salvage values 
during  rentals and landing fees were higher primarily due to an increase in aircraft usage as a result of incremental us freight volume 
operating income for also reflects the adoption of new rules from the financial accounting standards board for the treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
for fedex express  adoption of these new rules resulted in the cessation of million in goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses during this amortization amount was comparable to 
during  other operating expenses also increased at fedex express 
in the prior year  reimbursements from the usps for network expansion costs were reflected as credits to other operating expenses 
these reimbursements  however  had no effect on operating income  as they represented the recovery of incremental costs incurred 
partially offsetting operating costs during was a gain from the insurance settlement on an aircraft destroyed in an accident in july that resulted in a net million favorable impact on operating income 
during  other operating expenses included million from the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters 
fedex express outlook we expect revenue to increase at fedex express during  in both the domestic and international markets 
during  we expect the us economy to remain sluggish at least through our first fiscal quarter  with year over year improvement expected to be evident in our second half results 
we believe the fundamentals for domestic economic acceleration in the us economy are in place and  as a result  we expect to see improvements in both yields and volumes 
pension  healthcare and maintenance expenses are expected to continue to increase at a faster rate than revenue growth 
on june   we announced that fedex express will offer voluntary early retirement and severance programs during to continue resizing the fedex express us organization and improving profitability 
see cost savings initiatives for further discussion of these programs 
while the net cost of these programs is expected to negatively impact operating margin in  we expect margins at fedex express will begin to increase in due to these and other efforts 
our expectation of improved performance is based upon continued aggressive cost management actions and a return to solid growth in our us overnight box volumes related to anticipated improvements in the economy 
these cost management actions and improved volumes  along with a sharp focus on productivity  are expected to produce improved operational efficiency as volume growth is absorbed with minimal increases in operating costs 
fedex ground the following table compares revenues  operating expenses and operating income and margin dollars in millions and selected package statistics in thousands  except yield amounts for the years ended may percent change revenues    operating expenses salaries and employee benefits purchased transportation   rentals depreciation and amortization fuel maintenance and repairs intercompany charges other total operating expenses    operating income operating margin average daily package volume revenue per package yield fedex ground revenues fedex ground realized double digit revenue growth in both and due to increased volumes in our business to business shipments and continued growth of our home delivery service 
during  fedex home delivery added facilities to reach nearly coverage of the us population 
yield at fedex ground increased in  due to an average list price increase of  which became effective january  partially offsetting the effect of the price increase were higher levels of discounts and lower average weight per package 
in  year over year yield increases were due primarily to general rate increases  ongoing yield management and a slight increase in the mix of higher yielding packages 
in the third quarter of  fedex ground implemented a dynamic fuel surcharge  based on the spot price for on highway diesel fuel 
this surcharge ranged between and during and between and from february through may fedex ground operating income fedex ground experienced revenue and earnings growth during and operating margins improved in in spite of increased intercompany charges for sales  marketing  customer support and information technology costs 
operating expenses in most categories increased at a lower rate than the growth in revenues during in addition  fedex ground realized substantial improvements in pick up and delivery and linehaul productivity 
during  salaries and employee benefits increased due to higher pension costs and increases in staffing to support volume growth 
operating results during were also impacted by inclement weather during the winter and spring  which was more severe than in previous years 
the increase in operating income in was primarily attributable to package volume growth  higher yields  productivity improvements in both employee and contractor labor and effective cost management 
facility openings and expansions  as well as increased investments in information systems  resulted in increased depreciation  rental and other property related expenses during salaries  wages and benefits also were higher in due to additional full time equivalents and higher pension and healthcare costs 
costs for variable and other incentive compensation plans were significantly higher during  reflecting fedex ground s outstanding financial performance 
the increase in operating income in both and was also attributable to improved home delivery service results 
in september  fedex home delivery completed the build out of its national network  enabling it to reach nearly of us residences  with evening  weekend and day and time specific delivery options  all backed by a money back guarantee 
our home delivery service became profitable during this service had an operating loss of million during and million during fedex ground s results also reflect rebranding and reorganization expenses of million  which were expensed as incurred and consisted of incremental external costs for rebranding vans  trailers and signage 
fedex ground outlook we expect revenue at fedex ground will continue to grow in  although at a slower rate than in and we will continue to pursue revenue growth in all services  led by increased home delivery and overnight ground package volumes 
overall yield improvement will be a primary focus as we continue to expect a very competitive pricing environment 
fedex ground will also continue to place emphasis on improving on time delivery  productivity and safety 
during  we expect capital spending will grow significantly at fedex ground as we continue to focus on network capacity expansion 
we also expect higher pension costs  higher facility expenses due to expansion and increases in intercompany allocations for sales  marketing  customer support and information technology costs 
we expect the operating margin will be comparable to fedex freight the following table shows revenues  operating expenses and operating income and margins dollars in millions and selected statistics for the years ended may percent change revenues   operating expenses salaries and employee benefits   purchased transportation rentals depreciation and amortization fuel maintenance and repairs intercompany charges other total operating expenses   operating income operating margin average daily shipments in thousands weight per shipment lbs    yield revenue per hundredweight results for include the financial results of fedex freight west from december  and of fedex freight east from january  the date of acquisition for financial reporting purposes 
therefore  results are not comparable to statistics for are based on the portion of the year including both fedex freight west and fedex freight east january through may 
fedex freight revenues revenues at fedex freight increased during  despite the continued impact of a slow economy  severe winter weather and one fewer operating day during the year 
the increase in revenue was attributable to improved yields during average daily shipments and weight per shipment were flat  while yield increased 
contributing to the increase in yield during were the impact of a general rate increase in july  favorable contractual renewals  higher fuel surcharge revenue and additional volumes related to ez flyer  our premium priced  interregional freight service 
in  revenues were higher due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of operations for fedex freight east 
however  revenues were impacted by the economic slowdown and by a decrease in our fuel surcharge during in  average daily shipments were comparable to the prior year  weight per shipment was down and yield was up 
fedex freight operating income the increase in operating income at fedex freight during was attributable to revenue growth and cost management 
lower depreciation and amortization during reflects increased gains from the sale of operating assets in the ordinary course of business 
operating margins in reflect higher maintenance and repairs expenses  which include million of expenses associated with rebranding fedex freight east and fedex freight west under the name fedex freight 
the rebranding project began in the fourth quarter of and is expected to be complete in  with total rebranding costs of approximately million to million 
these costs  which are being expensed as incurred  consist primarily of incremental external costs for rebranding tractors and trailers 
during  operating margins reflect the elimination of goodwill amortization  partially offset by million of rebranding expenses 
the increase in operating income during also reflects the inclusion of a full year of operations as well as the cessation of million of goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses prior to the adoption of new accounting rules as discussed in consolidated results 
fedex freight outlook we expect revenue to continue to grow in  largely due to yield improvements and continued growth of higher yielding interregional and international services 
in april  we announced that we are offering ocean and ground service from asia to virtually every continental us zip code 
this service helps reduce inventory cycle time with fast overall transit times and fewer processes than traditional ocean service from asia 
on june   we announced a general rate increase of to be effective june  volume growth  yield management  enhanced productivity and cost control measures continue to be major focus areas for fedex freight in order to minimize the effects of a soft economy in a highly competitive pricing environment 
other operations other operations include fedex custom critical  a critical shipment carrier  fedex trade networks  whose subsidiaries form a global trade services company  fedex services  a provider of sales  marketing and it support  primarily for fedex express and fedex ground  and a provider of supply chain management services  and intercompany revenue eliminations  which are not material 
also included in this category are the operating results of fedex freight west prior to december  revenues from other operations were million in down compared to million in down and billion in in  the slight decrease in revenues from our other operations reflects the termination of certain unprofitable supply chain services contracts  partially offset by increased revenues at fedex custom critical 
revenues at fedex custom critical were higher in  due to increased yields  and lower in  largely due to the economic downturn 
the demand for services provided by this operating subsidiary critical shipments is highly elastic and tied to key economic indicators  principally in the automotive industry  where volumes have been depressed since calendar a significant portion of the decrease in revenues from other operations during reflects the fact that results for this category no longer include fedex freight west s revenues see fedex freight 
operating income from other operations was million in compared to million in and an operating loss of million in the improvement in operating income in was primarily attributable to fedex trade networks 
in  the improvement over reflects reduced operating costs at fedex supply chain services 
on march   a subsidiary of fedex trade networks acquired certain assets of fritz companies  inc  which provide essential customs clearance services exclusively for fedex express in three us locations  at a cost of million 
financial condition liquidity cash and cash equivalents totaled million at may   compared to million at may  the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the years ended may in millions net cash provided by operating activities    cash used in investing activities capital investments and other    business acquisitions cash used in provided by financing activities principal payments on debt proceeds from debt issuances purchases of treasury stock dividends paid other financing activities net increase in cash the million decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities in reflected increased funding to our qualified pension plans  partially offset by improved earnings and lower levels of estimated federal income tax payments 
although not required  we made cash contributions to our qualified us domestic pension plans of billion during compared to million in and million in 
see further discussion concerning our pension plan contributions in critical accounting policies 
in  the increase in cash flows from operating activities reflected increases in earnings which included fedex freight for an entire year and aggressive working capital management 
cash used for capital investments 
capital expenditures were lower in due to management s cost reduction actions in and  despite deliveries of aircraft during that were scheduled and committed to well before the economic slowdown 
in  capital expenditures were lower in spite of capital spending related to the addition of fedex freight east 
see capital resources for further discussion 
cash used for business acquisitions 
during  a subsidiary of fedex trade networks acquired certain assets of fritz companies  inc at a cost of million 
during  we acquired fedex freight east for approximately million with a combination of cash and fedex common stock 
see note of the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of these acquisitions 
debt financing activities 
from time to time  we finance certain operating and investing activities through the issuance of commercial paper 
our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under two revolving credit agreements  totaling billion  and reduces the amount available under these agreements 
during the third quarter of  commercial paper borrowings of million were necessary to finance part of the cash contribution to our qualified pension plans 
all of the commercial paper borrowings were repaid by april  at may   no commercial paper was outstanding and the entire billion under the revolving credit agreements was available for future borrowings 
there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at may  for more information regarding these credit facilities  see note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  certain existing debt at fedex express matured  principally million of senior notes 
also  in the fourth quarter of  we prepaid the remaining million of debt that was assumed in connection with the purchase of fedex freight east 
in the third quarter of  we issued million of senior unsecured notes 
net proceeds from the borrowings were used to repay indebtedness  principally borrowings under our commercial paper program  and for general corporate purposes 
these notes are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that are not considered minor under securities and exchange commission sec regulations 
during  we filed a billion shelf registration statement with the sec to provide flexibility and efficiency when obtaining financing 
under this shelf registration statement we may issue  in one or more offerings  either unsecured debt securities  common stock or a combination of such instruments 
the entire billion is available for future financings 
cash used for share repurchases 
during and  our board of directors authorized us to buy back a total of million shares of common stock 
during  we repurchased million shares at an average price of per share and this decreased cash flows by million 
we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock in  at a cost of approximately million or an average of per share 
there were no stock repurchases during a total of million shares remain under existing share repurchase authorizations 
dividends 
our board of directors declared our first ever cash dividend on may  total dividends paid in were million 
on june   our board declared a dividend of per share of common stock  which we paid on july  to stockholders of record as of the close of business on june  we expect to continue quarterly dividend payments  although each subsequent dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our board of directors 
other liquidity information 
we have taken actions discussed in results of operations  including the new portable pension account option for eligible fedex employees and resizing efforts at fedex express  which are expected to reduce our long term costs and cash outflows 
we will remain focused on cost containment and capital expenditure discipline so we may continue to manage our cash flow in the future 
we believe that cash flow from operations  our commercial paper program and revolving bank credit facilities will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future 
capital resources we have invested aggressively to build our global network and information systems 
in recent years  we invested in the strategic acquisitions that have become fedex ground  fedex freight  fedex custom critical and fedex trade networks 
the sustained need for capital investments and strategic acquisitions throughout those years meant that we were not able to generate a positive cash flow after investing activities until despite the recent decrease in capital spending  our operations remain capital intensive  characterized by significant investments in aircraft  vehicles  computer hardware and software and telecommunications equipment  package handling facilities and sort equipment 
the amount and timing of capital additions depend on various factors  including preexisting contractual commitments  anticipated volume growth  domestic and international economic conditions  new or enhanced services  geographical expansion of services  competition  availability of satisfactory financing and actions of regulatory authorities 
the following table compares capital expenditures for the years ended may in millions aircraft and related equipment facilities and sort equipment information and technology investments vehicles and other equipment total capital expenditures    see note to the accompanying audited financial statements for a breakdown of capital expenditures by segment 
capital expenditures were lower during and lower in the majority of this decrease was primarily at fedex express  where capital expenditures were and lower in and  respectively 
during both years  we continued to make investments in fedex ground s infrastructure and information technology and we also made capital investments to expand fedex freight 
we took various actions in and in order to reduce future capital expenditures  including those related to the curtailment of our md program discussed in consolidated results and the cancellation of certain contractual obligations to purchase md aircraft 
these actions resulted in the elimination of approximately billion in future capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures will be approximately billion in  with much of the year over year increase coming from the multi year capacity expansion of the fedex ground network 
we expect that internally generated cash  as well as financing available through leasing transactions or borrowings  will be adequate to meet our future capital requirements 
because of substantial lead times associated with the manufacture or modification of aircraft  we must generally plan our aircraft orders or modifications three to eight years in advance 
therefore  we must make commitments regarding our airlift requirements many years before aircraft are actually needed 
we are closely managing our capital spending based on current and anticipated volume levels and will defer or limit capital additions where economically feasible  while continuing to invest strategically in growing business segments 
contractual cash obligations the following table sets forth a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of may  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
payments due by fiscal year there after total in millions amounts reflected in balance sheet long term debt  capital lease obligations other cash obligations not reflected in balance sheet operating leases       unconditional purchase obligations total cash obligations      represents principal maturities  excluding interest

see note to the accompanying audited financial statements 
see note to the accompanying audited financial statements 
we have certain contingent liabilities that are not accrued in our balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these contingent liabilities are not included in the table above 
amounts reflected in balance sheet we have other commercial commitments  not reflected in the table above  that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations  including surety bonds and standby letters of credit 
these instruments are generally required under certain us domestic self insurance programs and are used in the normal course of international operations 
while the notional amounts of these instruments are material  there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them because the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our balance sheet 
during the fourth quarter of  fedex express amended four leases for md aircraft  which now commits fedex express to firm purchase obligations for two of these aircraft during both and as a result  the amended leases were accounted for as capital leases  which added million to both long term assets and long term liabilities 
we have other long term liabilities reflected in our balance sheet  including deferred income taxes  pension and postretirement healthcare liabilities and self insurance accruals 
the payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities 
therefore  the timing of these payments cannot be determined  except for amounts estimated to be payable in that are included in current liabilities 
other cash obligations not reflected in balance sheet the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases principally aircraft and facilities with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at may  in the past  we financed a significant portion of our aircraft needs and certain other equipment needs using operating leases a type of off balance sheet financing 
at the time that the decision to lease was made  we determined that these operating leases would provide economic benefits favorable to ownership with respect to market values  liquidity and after tax cash flows 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet  however  the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in note to the accompanying audited financial statements  as well as in the table above 
credit rating agencies routinely use this information concerning minimum lease payments required for our operating leases to calculate our debt capacity 
furthermore  our debt covenants would not be adversely affected by the capitalization of some or all of our operating leases 
we have guarantees under certain operating leases  amounting to million as of may   for the residual values of aircraft  vehicles and facilities at the end of the respective operating lease periods 
based upon our expectation that none of these leased assets will have a residual value at the end of the lease term that is less than the value specified in the related operating lease agreement  we do not believe it is probable that we will be required to fund any amounts under the terms of these guarantee arrangements 
accordingly  no accruals have been recognized for these guarantees 
see note to the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of our guarantees and indemnifications 
certain of these operating leases were arranged using variable interest entities under terms that are considered customary in the airline industry 
as discussed in note to the accompanying audited financial statements  we expect to consolidate one of these entities in the second quarter of in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
we expect this consolidation to increase our long term assets and long term liabilities by approximately million at september  consolidation will not materially affect our results of operations and our debt covenants will not be adversely affected 
in the future  other forms of secured financing and direct purchases may be used to obtain capital assets if we determine that they best suit our needs 
we have been successful in obtaining investment capital  both domestic and international  for long term leases on acceptable terms  although the marketplace for such capital can become restricted depending on a variety of economic factors 
we believe the capital resources available to us provide flexibility to access the most efficient markets for financing capital acquisitions  including aircraft  and are adequate for our future capital needs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in many cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large  global corporation 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
the policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
pension cost we sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees 
the accounting for pension benefits is determined by standardized accounting and actuarial methods that include numerous estimates  including discount rates  expected long term investment returns on plan assets  future salary increases  and employee turnover  mortality and retirement ages 
we consider the most critical of these estimates to be our discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the method for determining the value of plan assets to which the expected long term rate of return is applied and the expected rate of future increases in salaries 
for fedex  the determination of a year s pension cost is highly sensitive to changes in these estimates because we have a large workforce that is relatively young and we have a significant amount of assets in the pension plans 
for example  only of the participants covered under our principal pension plan are retired and currently receiving benefits and the average remaining service life of our employees approximates years normal retirement is at age 
therefore  the payout of pension benefits will occur over a long period in the future 
this long time period increases the sensitivity of our annual pension cost to changes in these key estimates 
total pension costs increased approximately million in and approximately million in and are expected to increase an additional million in pension costs are included in the salaries  wages and benefits caption in our income statements 
following are the components of the pension cost recognized in our income statements in millions service cost interest cost expected return on plan assets net amortization and deferral us accounting standards recognize that changes in the many estimates required to account for pensions occur routinely and the accounting rules require the use of techniques to normalize the effects of these changes typically over the average remaining service lives of our employees 
for example  the difference between the estimated return on plan assets and the actual returns for the period are reflected as unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
if the aggregate amount of actuarial gains and losses exceeds a certain corridor level  the excess is amortized over future periods  increasing or decreasing pension costs in those periods 
the net amortization and deferral component of pension cost included in the table above reflects the impact of amortizing actuarial gains and losses on pension cost 
in  we expect this component of our pension cost to increase due to the impact of lower than expected returns on pension plan assets over the past three years 
the anticipated increase in pension cost is attributable to the following factors in millions decrease in discount rate reduction in expected return on plan assets net effect of the amortization of actuarial losses reduction in rate of salary increases and other net estimated increase in pension cost accounting standards also require immediate balance sheet recognition of additional pension obligations when the accumulated benefit obligation abo exceeds the fair value of plan assets at the pension plan measurement date 
during  we made tax deductible contributions of billion to our qualified us domestic pension plans in order to fully fund the abo of these plans 
these contributions were not required under the minimum pension funding rules of the employee retirement income security act erisa 
following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plans in millions funded status of plans accumulated benefit obligation abo qualified us domestic plans   other plans total abo   projected benefit obligation pbo fair value of plan assets   pbo in excess of plan assets  unrecognized actuarial losses  principally due to investments and changes in discount rate  unamortized prior service cost and other amounts included in balance sheet  components of amounts included in balance sheet prepaid pension cost  accrued pension liability minimum pension liability intangible asset and other net amounts recognized in balance sheet  cash amounts cash contributions during the year  benefit payments during the year the funded status of the plans reflects a snapshot of the state of our long term pension liabilities at the plan measurement date 
declining interest rates which increase the discounted value of the pbo and recent stock market losses have significantly impacted the funded status of our plans 
however  our plans remain adequately funded to provide benefits to our employees as they come due and current benefit payments are nominal compared to our total plan assets benefit payments for were less than of plan assets 
in order to improve the funded status of our pension plans  we expect to continue to make tax deductible contributions to the plans in the future 
currently  we do not expect any material contributions for will be required under erisa 
we have also implemented the new portable pension account previously discussed in outlook  which will help reduce the long term growth of our pension liabilities 
the net amounts reflected in our balance sheet related to pension items include a substantial prepaid pension asset 
this results from excess cash contributions to the plans over amounts that are recognized as pension expense for financial accounting purposes 
amounts accrued as liabilities including minimum pension liabilities relate primarily to unfunded nonqualified plans and international pension plans where additional funding may not provide a current tax deduction 
discount rate 
this is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments that have been earned to date the pbo to their net present value 
the discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date february and affects the succeeding year s pension cost 
a decrease in the discount rate has a negative effect on pension expense 
this assumption is highly sensitive for fedex and a one basis point change in the discount rate at february  affects our pension expense by approximately million and our abo by approximately million 
for example  the basis point decrease in the discount rate to for from for will negatively affect our pension cost by approximately million 
our pension cost was negatively affected by approximately million by the basis point decrease in the discount rate to for from for we determine the discount rate which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled as of the measurement date with the assistance of actuaries  who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bonds with coupon payments and maturities that generally match our expected benefit payments 
this methodology is consistently applied and involves little subjectivity 
however  the calculated discount rate can change materially from year to year based on economic market conditions that impact yields on corporate bonds 
plan assets 
pension plan assets are invested primarily in listed securities 
our pension plans hold only a minimal investment in fedex common stock 
the estimated average rate of return on plan assets is a long term  forward looking assumption that also materially affects our pension cost 
it is intended to be the expected future long term rate of earnings on plan assets 
at february   with nearly billion of plan assets  a one basis point change in this assumption affects pension cost by approximately  a decrease in the assumed expected long term rate of return has a negative effect on pension expense 
establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter 
management considers the following factors in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liabilities  which determines the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets 
the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected compound return we can reasonably expect those investment classes to earn over the next to year time period or such other time period that may be appropriate 
the investment returns we can reasonably expect our active investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in indexed funds 
we review the expected long term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate 
also  we periodically commission detailed asset liability studies performed by third party professional investment advisors and actuaries 
these studies project our estimated future pension payments and evaluate the efficiency of the allocation of our pension plan assets into various investment categories 
these studies also generate probability adjusted expected future returns on those assets 
the study performed for supported the reasonableness of our return assumption based on our liability duration and market conditions at the time we set this assumption 
because of the introduction of the portable pension account for which will reduce our liability duration over time  as well as the significant additional contributions we made into the plans in late and the continuing deterioration of the equity markets through february   we performed a more recent asset liability study for the results of this study support our current asset allocation strategy  which is summarized below asset class target of plan assets domestic equities international equities private equities total equities long duration fixed income securities other fixed income securities the actual allocation of our assets at february  was weighted more toward fixed income securities due to the depressed value of our equity investments and uninvested cash contributions of million made on february  the asset liability study for supports a long term return on assets of at least 
our actual compound return on assets was for the year period ended march  based on these factors  we selected as our estimated future rate of return on pension assets for the basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return for will negatively affect our pension cost by approximately million 
our pension cost was negatively affected by approximately million by the basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return to for from for investment losses have also reduced the level of assets to which the expected long term rate of return is applied  which will further increase our pension cost in cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses subject to amortization were approximately billion through february  these unrecognized losses primarily reflect the decline in the stock market over the past three years and may be recovered in future periods 
however  to the extent that market performance does not improve  these unrecognized losses are recognized in future periods in the net amortization and deferral component of pension expense 
pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan assets at the measurement date 
we use a calculated value method  which helps mitigate short term volatility in market performance both increases and decreases 
the other acceptable method of valuing plan assets is to use the market value of the assets at the measurement date 
the application of the calculated value accounting method reduced pension cost by approximately million and pension cost by approximately million compared to the market value method 
salary increases 
the assumed future increase in salaries and wages is also a key estimate in determining pension cost 
we correlate changes in estimated future salary increases to changes in the discount rate since that is an indicator of general inflation and cost of living adjustments and general estimated levels of profitability since most incentive compensation is a component of pensionable wages 
currently  a one basis point change in the rate of estimated future salaries affects pension costs by approximately  a decrease in this rate will decrease pension cost 
the decrease in this assumption to for from will favorably impact pension cost by approximately million 
for  the decrease in this assumption to from in favorably impacted pension cost by approximately million 
self insurance accruals we are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims  vehicle accidents and general business liabilities  and benefits paid under employee healthcare programs 
at may  there were approximately million of self insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet million at may  
the measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
we account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods  which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred  including those claims incurred but not reported 
these methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
other acceptable methods of accounting for these accruals include measurement of claims outstanding and projected payments 
we believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals 
however  the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known 
we believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis 
nevertheless  changes in healthcare costs  accident frequency and severity  and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities 
long lived assets property and equipment 
our key businesses are capital intensive 
more than of our total assets are invested in our transportation and information systems infrastructures 
we capitalize only those costs that meet the definition of capital assets under accounting standards 
accordingly  repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred 
the depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives  and the determination of any salvage values  requires management to make judgments about future events 
because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over to years  we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset 
this evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment 
these estimates affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and  ultimately  the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
historically  gains and losses on operating equipment have not been material typically less than million annually 
however  such amounts may differ materially in the future due to technological obsolescence  accident frequency  regulatory changes and other factors beyond our control 
at various times during  as studies were completed  we made changes to the useful lives and residual values of certain aircraft fleet types  as well as tractors  trailers and other equipment 
these changes resulted in a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million 
had all of these changes been made as of june   depreciation expense for would have decreased by an additional million 
because we must plan years in advance for future volume levels and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections  we have risks that asset capacity may exceed demand and that an impairment of our assets may occur 
the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value 
because the cash flows of our transportation networks cannot be identified to individual assets  and based on the ongoing profitability of our operations  we have not experienced any significant impairment of assets to be held and used 
however  from time to time we make decisions to remove certain long lived assets from service based on projections of reduced capacity needs and those decisions may result in an impairment charge 
assets held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criteria are met 
for example  in we made the decision to eliminate certain excess aircraft capacity at fedex express related to our md conversion program 
the decision allowed us to avoid approximately billion in future capital expenditures and resulted in an impairment charge of million to reduce the value of the affected assets to their estimated fair value 
the estimate of fair value requires management to make assumptions about the most likely potential value of assets to be disposed of and the estimated future costs of disposal 
during we substantially completed the disposal of the impaired md program assets  which resulted in a favorable adjustment of million 
see notes and to the accompanying audited financial statements for more information concerning impairment charges 
there were no material asset impairment charges recognized in leases 
we utilize operating leases to finance a significant number of our aircraft 
over the years  we have found these leasing arrangements to be favorable from a cash flow and risk management standpoint 
such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor 
as disclosed in contractual cash obligations and note to the accompanying audited financial statements  at may  we had approximately billion on an undiscounted basis of future commitments for payments under operating leases 
the future commitments for operating leases are not reflected as a liability in our balance sheet because the leases do not meet the accounting definition of capital leases 
the determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life 
we believe we have well defined and controlled processes for making this evaluation 
during the fourth quarter of  fedex express amended four leases for md aircraft 
as a result  the amended leases are now accounted for as capital leases  which added million to both long term assets and long term liabilities at may  goodwill 
we have in excess of billion of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from the acquisition of businesses 
new accounting standards adopted in require that we review this goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and cease all goodwill amortization 
as previously indicated  the adoption of these new rules resulted in an impairment of our recorded goodwill of million in at one of our smaller businesses 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows of each of our reporting units to determine their estimated fair values 
changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates 
however  once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
we performed our annual impairment tests in with no indicated impairment to any of our goodwill balances 
revenue recognition we believe the policies adopted to recognize revenue are critical because an understanding of the accounting applied in this area is fundamental to assessing our overall financial performance and because revenue and revenue growth are key measures of financial performance in the marketplace 
our businesses are primarily involved in the direct pickup and delivery of commercial package and freight shipments 
our employees and agents are involved throughout the process and our operational  billing and accounting systems directly capture and control all relevant information necessary to record revenue  bill customers and collect amounts due to us 
we recognize revenue upon delivery of shipments or  for our logistics and trade services businesses  upon the completion of services 
transportation industry practice includes two primary methods for revenue recognition for shipments in process at the end of an accounting period recognize all revenue and the related delivery costs when shipments are delivered or recognize a portion of the revenue earned for shipments that have been picked up but not yet delivered at period end and accrue delivery costs as incurred 
we use the second method  we recognize the portion of revenue earned at the balance sheet date for shipments in transit and accrue all delivery costs as incurred 
we believe this accounting policy effectively and consistently matches revenue with expenses and recognizes liabilities as incurred 
there are three key estimates that are included in the recognition and measurement of our revenue and related accounts receivable under the policies described above estimates for unbilled revenue on shipments that have been delivered  estimates for revenue associated with shipments in transit  and estimates for future adjustments to revenue or accounts receivable for billing adjustments and bad debts 
unbilled revenue 
primarily due to cycle billings to some of our larger customers  there is a time lag between the completion of a shipment and the generation of an invoice 
at the end of a month  unprocessed invoices may be as much as one third of the total month s revenue 
this revenue is recognized through systematic accrual processes 
invoices that are essentially complete represent most of these accruals  with little subjectivity over the amounts accrued 
the remaining amounts are estimated using actual package or shipment volumes and current trends of average revenue per shipment 
these estimates are adjusted in subsequent months to the actual amounts invoiced 
because of the low level of subjectivity inherent in these accrual processes  the estimates have historically not varied significantly from actual amounts subsequently invoiced 
shipments in process 
the majority of our shipments have short cycle times  therefore  less than of a total month s revenue is typically in transit at the end of a period 
we periodically perform studies to measure the percentage of completion for shipments in process 
at month end  we estimate the amount of revenue earned on shipments in process based on actual shipments picked up  the scheduled day of delivery  the day of the week on which the month ends which affects the percentage of completion and current trends in our average price for the respective services 
we believe these estimates provide a reasonable approximation of the actual revenue earned at the end of a period 
future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable 
like many companies  we experience some credit loss on our trade accounts receivable 
historically  our credit losses from bad debts have not fluctuated materially because our credit management processes have been highly effective 
we also recognize billing adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for certain discounts  money back service guarantees and billing corrections 
estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are regularly updated based on historical experience of bad debts  adjustments processed and current collections trends 
total allowances for these future adjustments were million at may  and million at may  we consider the sensitivity and subjectivity of these estimates to be moderate  as changes in economic conditions  pricing arrangements and billing systems can significantly affect the estimates used to determine the allowances

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk while we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates  we have no significant exposure to changing interest rates on our long term debt because the interest rates are fixed 
as disclosed in note to the accompanying audited financial statements  we have outstanding long term debt exclusive of capital leases of billion at may  and market risk for fixed rate  long term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately million as of may  and million as of may  the underlying fair values of our long term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities 
currently  derivative instruments are not used to manage interest rate risk 
while we are a global provider of transportation services  the substantial majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
the distribution of our foreign currency denominated transactions is such that currency declines in some areas of the world are often offset by currency gains of equal magnitude in other areas of the world 
the principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar and japanese yen 
foreign currency fluctuations during did not have a material effect on our results of operations 
at may   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately million for the comparable amount in the prior year was approximately million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in practice  our experience is that exchange rates in the principal foreign markets where we have foreign currency denominated transactions tend to have offsetting fluctuations 
therefore  the calculation above is not indicative of our actual experience in foreign currency transactions 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting reported operating results  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors services become more or less attractive 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 
we have market risk for changes in the price of jet and diesel fuel  however  this risk is largely mitigated by revenue from our fuel surcharges 
in  we implemented new indices for calculating us domestic fuel surcharges  which more closely link the fuel surcharges to prevailing market prices for fuel 
in  we implemented this methodology for determining a fuel surcharge on international shipments as well 
therefore  a hypothetical change in the price of fuel would not be expected to materially affect our earnings 
however  our fuel surcharges have a lag that exists before they are adjusted for changes in jet and diesel fuel prices and fuel prices can fluctuate within certain ranges before resulting in a change in our fuel surcharges 
therefore  our operating income may be affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in a change in our fuel surcharges 
for  market risk for jet fuel was estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase in jet fuel prices applied to projected usage and amounted to approximately million  net of hedging settlements 
as of may   all outstanding jet fuel hedging contracts were effectively closed by entering into offsetting jet fuel hedging contracts 
see note to the accompanying audited financial statements for accounting policy and additional information regarding jet fuel hedging contracts 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
