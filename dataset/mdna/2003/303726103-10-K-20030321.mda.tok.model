in process research and development the following table summarizes the significant assumptions underlying the valuations of ipr d for our significant acquisitions estimated weighted cost to average ipr d complete discount cost of charge technology rate capital dollars in millions dpp amounts charged to ipr d represent the estimated fair value based upon risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete projects 
at the respective dates of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly these costs were expensed at the acquisition dates 
the acquisition of dpp added breadth to our power discrete products portfolio  including mosfet s  igbt s and rectifiers 
the acquisition also gave us an expanded presence in the automotive and industrial markets 
one project  v n channel trench  out of six valued  accounted for approximately of the total ipr d charge and was approximately complete at the date of acquisition 
all projects were completed on schedule 
as of december   revenue for the major dpp projects were ahead of forecast 
liquidity and capital resources we have a borrowing capacity of million on a revolving basis for working capital and general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  under our senior credit facility 
at december   adjusted for outstanding letters of credit  we had million available under this senior credit facility 
at december   we had additional outstanding letters of credit and guarantees totaling million that were issued on behalf of unaffiliated companies with which we currently have a strategic investment or relationship 
these amounts outstanding were not issued under the senior credit facility  and accordingly do not impact available borrowings under the facility 
in connection with the financing of the dpp acquisition  on january   we sold million aggregate principal of senior subordinated notes at face value 
interest on these notes is paid semi annually on february and august of each year  and the first interest payment was made august  we may redeem the notes on or after february  prior to february   we may redeem up to of the notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings 
the notes are issued by fairchild semiconductor corporation and are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by fairchild international and its other us subsidiaries 
on october  we sold million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due november  the notes are unsecured obligations  and are convertible into common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
the notes rank on a parity with our existing senior subordinated debt and are and will be subordinated to all existing and future

the notes are issued by fairchild semiconductor corporation and are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by fairchild international and its other us subsidiaries and are convertible into the common stock of fairchild international 
on may   we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of its class a common stock at a price to the public of per share 
on june   the underwriters of the offering exercised their option to cover over allotments and purchased a further  shares 
the underwriting discount was per share 
the total of  shares included  newly issued shares sold by the company and  shares sold by an existing stockholder 
we did not receive any proceeds from shares sold by the existing stockholder 
the net proceeds to the company after the underwriting discount and other related expenses were approximately million 
on june   we used some of the proceeds raised in the follow on offering to redeem all million of our senior subordinated notes that were due in march  at a price of of face value 
in connection with the redemption  the company had one time charges totaling million  including million for the call premium and other transaction fees and a million non cash write off of deferred financing fees associated with the original bond offering 
our senior credit facility  the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes  senior subordinated notes and convertible senior subordinated notes and other debt instruments we may enter into in the future may impose various restrictions and covenants on us which could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions  to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities 
the restrictive covenants include limitations on consolidations  mergers and acquisitions  restrictions on creating liens  restrictions on paying dividends or making other similar restricted payments  restrictions on asset sales  restrictions on capital expenditures and limitations on incurring indebtedness  among other restrictions 
the covenants in the senior credit facility relating to financial ratios also include a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum senior leverage ratio 
provided there are no further outstanding balances under the senior credit facility  compliance with these ratios is not required until march   at which time we do not anticipate any non compliance 
the senior credit facility also limits our ability to modify our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  or enter into shareholder agreements  voting trusts or similar arrangements 
under our debt instruments  the subsidiaries of fairchild semiconductor corporation cannot be restricted  except to a limited extent  from paying dividends or making advances to fairchild semiconductor corporation 
we believe that funds generated from operations  together with existing cash  will be sufficient to meet our debt obligations over the next twelve months 
we expect that existing cash and available funds from our senior credit facility and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements and to fund our research and development and planned capital expenditures for the remainder of the year and for the next twelve months 
we had capital expenditures of million in this capital primarily was spent to expand capacity in support of in sourcing of capacity  including construction of our new facility in suzhou  china  and our e business initiatives 
we frequently evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities  obtain credit facilities from lenders or restructure our long term debt to further strengthen our financial position 
the sale of additional equity or convertible securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional borrowing or equity investment may be required to fund future acquisitions 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million  an increase of million from december  during the  our operations provided million in cash compared to million of cash in this decrease reflects a decrease in net income adjusted for non cash items of million  and a decrease in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
cash used in investing activities during totaled million  compared to million in the decrease primarily results from a net cash inflow for acquisitions and divestitures of million versus a net cash outflow in for acquisitions and divestitures of million

fairchild semiconductor international  inc on a stand alone basis has no cash flow from operations and no cash requirements for the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies include the policies of revenue recognition  sales reserves  inventory valuation  the impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the judgments and estimates underlying all of our accounting policies  including those related to revenue recognition  sales reserves  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
materially different results in the amount and timing of our actual results for any period could occur if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of semiconductor products is recognized when title transfers to the customer  including distributors  which is generally upon shipment 
no revenue is recognized 
table of contents unless there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
contract manufacturing revenues are recognized upon completion of the contracted service 
sales reserves 
sales reserves generally fall into four categories customer material return reserves  distributor contract sales debit reserves  prompt payment discount reserves  and other distribution reserves 
customer material returns result from product quality  administrative or other defect issues 
distributor contract sales debits are credits given to distributors to ensure distributor profitability on individual resale transactions 
prompt payment discounts are enticements given to customers to ensure payment is made in a timely manner 
customer material reserves  distributor contract sales debit reserves and prompt payment discount reserves are based upon historical rates of return or claims and any known  specifically identified unusual returns 
other sales reserves are recorded based upon individual contracts with distributors that may call for reimbursement of product scrapped or reimbursement of price changes that affect the distributors inventory carrying value 
historically  we have not experienced material differences between our estimated sales reserves and actual results 
inventory valuation 
in determining the net realizable value of our inventories  we review the valuations of inventory considered excessively old  and therefore subject to  obsolescence and inventory in excess of customer backlog 
we also adjust the valuation of inventory when estimated actual cost is significantly different than standard cost and to value inventory at the lower of cost or market 
once established  write downs of inventory are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of inventory 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting rules for goodwill as of the beginning of  we completed a goodwill impairment review for the reporting units that have goodwill associated with them 
we also performed an annually required review during the fourth quarter of  and in both reviews we found no impairment 
we will perform a similar review annually  or more frequently  if indicators of potential impairment arise 
our impairment review process is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis  which uses our estimates of revenues  driven by market growth rates and estimated costs  as well as utilizing a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with our cost of capital and the risk inherent in our current business model 
for all other long lived assets  our impairment review process is based upon an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows 
factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant technological changes  which would render equipment and manufacturing process  obsolete 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying value to the future undiscounted cash flows 
future undiscounted cash flows include estimates of future revenues  driven by market growth rates  and estimated future costs 
income taxes 
we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we must also make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets which we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by sfas no 
 
table of contents accounting for income taxes 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates  change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased  resulting in increased income tax expense 
conversely  if we are ultimately able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided  the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
forward looking statements this annual report includes forward looking statements as that term is defined in section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as we believe  we expect  we intend  may  will  should  seeks  approximately  plans  estimates  anticipates  or hopeful  or the negative of those terms or other comparable terms  or by discussions of our strategy  plans or future performance 
for example  the outlook section below contains numerous forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements in this report are made based on management s current expectations and estimates  which involve risks and uncertainties  including those described below and more specifically in the business risks section in item above 
among these factors are the following changes in regional or global economic or political conditions including as a result of terrorist attacks and responses to them  changes in demand for our products  changes in inventories at our customers and distributors  technological and product development risks  availability of manufacturing capacity  availability of raw materials  competitors actions  loss of key customers  order cancellations or reduced bookings  changes in manufacturing yields or output  and significant litigation 
factors that may affect our operating results are described in the business risks section in the quarterly and annual reports we file with the securities and exchange commission 
such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to be materially different from those in the forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
policy on business outlook disclosure and quiet periods it is our current policy to update our business outlook at least twice each quarter 
the first update is near the beginning of each quarter  within the press release that announces the previous quarter s results 
the business outlook below is consistent with the outlook included in our january  press release announcing fourth quarter and full year results  as updated in a press release dated march  the second update is within a press release issued approximately two months into each quarter 
the current business outlook is accessible at the investor relations section of our website at www 
investor 
fairchildsemi 
com 
toward the end of each quarter  and until that quarter s results are publicly announced  we observe a quiet period  when the outlook is not updated to reflect management s current expectations 
the quiet period for the first quarter of will be from march  to april   when we plan to release our first quarter results 
except during quiet periods  the business outlook posted on our website reflects current guidance unless and until updated through a press release  sec filing or other public announcement 
during quiet periods  our business outlook  as posted on our website  announced in press releases and provided in quarterly  annual and special reports or other filing with the sec  should be considered to be historical  speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update by the company 
during quiet periods  fairchild semiconductor representatives will not comment about the business outlook of the company s financial results or expectations 
outlook we expect revenues in the first quarter of to be seasonally flat to down from the fourth quarter of at the end of  approximately of these guided revenues were already on backlog 
the pricing of this first quarter entering backlog was slightly lower than fourth quarter billings 
in addition  due to lower than expected turns orders which are orders that are placed and filled in the same quarter in our high voltage power business  we anticipate sequential gross margin declines for the first quarter

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially 
we use currency forward and combination option contracts to hedge firm commitments and currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions 
beginning in  similar instruments were also used to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign exchange denominated revenues 
gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure to us 
a majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do conduct these activities by way of transactions denominated in other currencies  primarily the korean won  malaysian ringgit  philippine peso  japanese yen  british pound  and the euro 
exposures in the korean won are minimal as won denominated revenues and costs generally offset one another 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in other foreign exchange rates  we have established hedging programs 
we utilize currency forward contracts and currency option contracts in these hedging programs 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the short term impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
for example  during the twelve months ended december   an adverse change in any one exchange rate defined as over the course of the year would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than million 
we have no interest rate exposure due to rate changes for the senior subordinated notes  the senior subordinated notes or the convertible senior subordinated notes 
however  we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the revolving credit facility due to its variable libor pricing 
for example  a basis point increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of million  assuming all borrowing capability was utilized 
there was no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility at december  or at any point during from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swaps or interest rate caps  primarily to reduce interest rate exposure 
as of december   we had no such instruments in place
