item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements statements included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical in nature are intended to be  and are hereby identified as  forward looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of canada southern cautions readers that forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
among these risks and uncertainties are uncertainties as to the costs  length and outcome of the kotaneelee litigation  pricing and production levels from the properties in which canada southern has interests  and the extent of the recoverable res erves at those properties 
the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
recently issued statements of financial accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement  effective in us gaap  for fiscal years beginning on or after june   requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of the fair value of a liability can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
similar standards have been introduced within canadian gaap effective for fiscal the effect of this pronouncement on the financial position of canada southern and the resulting canadian and us gaap differences have yet to be determined 
in august  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets 
statement no 
was effective for the fiscal year and did not have a material impact on canada southern s financial position 
contractual obligations a summary of canada southern s contractual obligations as of december  is provided in the following table operating lease obligations total critical accounting policies use of estimates inherent in the preparation of financial statements is the use of estimates and assumptions regarding certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements 
accordingly actual results may differ from the estimated amounts 
areas that involve the use of significant estimates critical the accounts of canada southern are outlined below 
full cost ceiling test calculations canada southern follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
the full cost method requires canada southern to calculate on a quarterly basis  a ceiling test or limitation of the amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance sheet 
the ceiling test is a cost recovery test  that compares the expected future net revenues from the company s oil and gas assets adjusted for certain items with the capitalized or net book value on the consolidated balance sheet 
if the capitalized costs on the consolidated balance sheet are in excess of the calculated ceiling  the excess must be immediately written off as a writedown expense 
the discounted present value of canada southern s proved natural gas  liquids  and oil reserves is a major component of the ceiling test calculation 
this component inherently contains many subjective judgments  such as projected future production rates  the timing of future expenditures  and the economic productive limit of the company s assets 
canada southern utilizes the resources of a professional independent engineer to evaluate all of its reserves on an annual basis 
the passage of time provides additional qualitative information regarding the company s reserves that could result in reserve revisions or re determinations 
future significant reductions in a property s production or a significant decrease in product pricing could result in a full cost ceiling test writedown 
in addition  significant changes in proven reserves will impact the calculation of depletion 
future site restoration the determination of the amount of future asset retirement obligations  asset retirement costs  reclamation  and other similar activities is subject to the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
such estimates include major items such as the remaining economic reserve life of a property as discussed above  the timing of abandonment  the costs related to the abandonment  and others 
significant changes in any of the assumptions could alter the amount of site restoration 
revenue recognition canada southern s accounting policy with respect to revenue recognition is conservative 
revenue under carried interest agreements is recorded in the period when the net proceeds become receivable  measurable and collection is reasonably assured 
under the carried interest agreements canada southern receives oil and natural gas revenues net of operating and capital costs incurred by the working interest participants 
the time the net revenues become receivable and collection is reasonably assured depends on the terms and conditions of the relevant agreements and the practices followed by the operator 
as a result  net revenues may lag the production month by one or more months 
in  the trial court judge rendered his decision with respect to the long outstanding litigation 
although canada southern estimates its award to be approximately  as the judgment is under appeal and collection of that amount is not assured  canada southern has not recorded the amount as revenue 
liquidity and capital resources at december   canada southern had approximately  of cash and cash equivalents 
these funds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes  including the continuation of the kotaneelee field litigation and for limited exploration and development until the completion of the litigation 
net cash flow provided from operations during was  compared to the funds provided from operations of  during decrease in income from operations net changes in accounts receivable and other net changes in current liabilities decrease in net cash provided by operations at december   most of canada southern s properties were carried interest properties including the kotaneelee field 
the majority of the carried interest properties in british columbia were converted to working interests in canada southern has budgeted capital expenditures in of approximately  for workovers  equipment  drilling and other activities 
canada southern s kotaneelee carried interest account reached undisputed pay out status on january  canada southern received its first payment of net production proceeds from the kotaneelee gas field during may on september   the trial court in calgary issued its written reasons for its decision in the kotaneelee litigation and on november  the court finalized its judgment 
the judgment affirms that  although the defendants have a continuing contractual obligation but not a fiduciary obligation to develop the kotaneelee gas field and market the field s gas at the earliest feasible date  they did not breach their contractual obligation to market the gas 
the court also ordered that the field s carried interest account be reduced by  and declared that gas produced at the field is not subject to processing fees 
although the court did not quantify the amount payable to canada southern as a result of the processing fee declaration and the adjustment of the carried interest account  canada s outhern has calculated that amount to be approximately  before any applicable taxes 
the trial court determined that the issue of whether interest accrued on the carried interest account had been abandoned 
the trial court retained jurisdiction on the issue of taxable costs  but the court has expressed a desire to defer its consideration of costs until the court of appeal rules on appeals taken by the parties 
canada southern has not recorded the above estimated  amount due because the decision has been appealed and collection of the amount is not assured 
the trial was lengthy  complicated and costly to all parties and canada southern expects that the parties who ultimately prevail in the litigation will argue for a substantial assessment of costs against the non prevailing party or parties 
the court has very broad discretion as to whether to award costs and disbursements and as to the calculation of any amounts to be awarded 
accordingly  canada southern is unable to determine whether  in the event that canada southern does not ultimately prevail on its claims in the litigation  costs will be assessed against canada southern or in what amounts 
however  since the costs incurred by the defendants have been substantial  and since the court has broad discretion in the awarding of costs  an award of costs to the defendants potentially could be material 
 as of december   canada southern had expended in excess of  on the litigation and believes the defendants have expended substantially more than that amount 
a cost award against canada southern could be of sufficient magnitude to necessitate a sale of canada southern s assets or a debt or equity financing to fund such an award 
there are no assurances that any such sale or financing would be consummated 
the plaintiffs and each of the defendants have filed appeals and or cross appeals of the trial court decision with the court of appeal in calgary  alberta 
all written filings were filed by both canada southern and the defendants prior to the court imposed deadline of december  the case management justice of the court of appeal has advised the parties to the litigation that oral arguments will be heard in early december unless earlier dates become available on the court s calendar 
canada southern has established a provision for its potential share of future site restoration costs 
the estimated amount of these costs  which totals approximately  is being provided for on a unit of production basis in accordance with existing legislation and industry practice 
at december   canada southern had accrued  of these costs with  remaining to be accrued in the future 
the estimated costs of abandoning carried interest wells are not included in future site restoration costs 
these costs would be paid by the working interest partners and charged to the carried interest account

because of the uncertainties as to production rates  natural gas prices and future capital expenditures  canada southern is unable to accurately predict the amount of future net production proceeds that it may receive from the field 
in addition  water production has increased since and the producing field may require the drilling of another water disposal well 
to alleviate the concern of water disposal capacity the operator improved the water handling capabilities of the surface equipment during the first quarter of if water production were to continue to increase  future gas production from the b well could be adversely impacted

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk canada southern does not have any significant exposure to market risk as the only market risk sensitive instruments are investments in commercial paper and marketable securities 
at december   the carrying value of such investments including those classified as cash and cash equivalents was  which was approximately equal to fair value and face value of the investments 
canada southern utilizes the guidance provided from the dominion bond rating service limited dbrs commercial paper and short term rating scale in evaluating its investments 
dbrs is the benchmark rating service for money markets in canada as are s p and moody s in the us this rating scale is meant to give an indication of the risk that the borrower will not fulfill its repayment obligations in a timely manner 
dbrs utilizes three main classifications of investment quality  r prime credit quality  r adequate credit quality  and r speculative 
within each main classification  dbrs uses subset grades to designate the relative standing of credit within the particular category high  mid or low 
generally only government of canada guaranteed investments earn an r high rating 
to ensure capital preservation  canada southern s investment policy allows only for investments within the highest quality ratings of r high  mid  or low 
given that credit ratings can change rapidly in today s economy  canada southern s current practice is to invest in a particular investment for periods no longer than days 
as a result of the strategy to select high quality investments in combination with short terms to maturity  canada southern expects to hold the investments to maturity  and realize maturity value 
in addition  the investments in marketable securities included investments held in united states currency  which are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations 
at december   the us dollar investments totaled  us   us
