item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview progenics is a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development and commercialization of innovative products to address the unmet medical needs of patients with debilitating conditions and life threatening diseases 
we commenced principal operations in late and since that time have been engaged primarily in research and development efforts  development of our manufacturing capabilities  establishment of corporate collaborations and raising capital 
in order to commercialize the principal products that we have under development  we will need to address a number of technological challenges and comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements 
accordingly  it is not possible to predict the amount of funds that will be required or the length of time that will pass before we receive revenues from sales of any of these products 
to date  product sales have consisted solely of limited revenues from the sale of research reagents 
we expect that sales of research reagents in the future will not significantly increase over current levels 
our other sources of revenues through december  have been payments received under our collaboration agreements  research grants and contracts related to our cancer and hiv programs and interest income 
to date  a majority of our expenditures have been for research and development activities 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase significantly as our programs progress and we make filings for related regulatory approvals 
with the exception of the years ended december  and  we have had recurring losses and had  at december   an accumulated deficit of approximately  we will require additional funds to complete the development of our products  to fund the cost of clinical trials and to fund operating losses that are expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
we do not expect our products under development to be commercialized in the near future 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues we recognized  and  of revenue for research and development services performed for the psma development company  llc  our joint venture with cytogen corporation  the jv during and  respectively 
we have a interest in the jv 
we were required to fund the first million of research and development costs and such amounts were recorded as capital contributions to the jv 
during the fourth quarter of  we surpassed the million threshold  at which time we began recognizing revenue for services and costs being provided to and paid by the jv 
the level of future revenues from the jv will be dependent upon the extent of research and development services requested by the jv and the future financial position of the jv 
we provide services to the jv under a services agreement 
as of march   and through december   the company was performing services for the jv under a month to month extension of the services agreement 
at december   and through march   the members were negotiating the terms of a new services agreement 
accordingly  future revenue will also be dependent upon the extension  if any  and terms of an amended services agreement 
the level of commitment by progenics and cytogen collectively  the members to fund the jv is based on an annual budget that is approved by both of the members 
as of march   the members were in the process of negotiating the annual budget for the jv and have committed to the jv that the operating budget for will be no less than the total expenses as set forth on the statement of operations for the jv for the year ended december  other contract research and development revenue declined from  in to  in primarily due to a decrease in funding received from bristol myers squibb company bms after we and bms mutually terminated our collaboration agreement in may we received  from bms in under the agreement and in revenues from contract research and development performed for other collaborators decreased from  in to  in as our commitments for such work were completed 
revenues from research grants increased from  in to  in the increase resulted from the funding of a greater number of grants in sales of research reagents increased from  in to  in resulting from increased orders for such reagents during 
back to contents expenses research and development expenses include scientific labor  supplies  facility costs  clinical trial costs  patent costs  and product manufacturing costs 
in late  we in licensed mntx methylnaltrexone  an investigational drug in late stage clinical development designed to reverse certain side effects of opiod pain medications 
the product has entered phase iii clinical trials and has become our lead product 
a major portion of our spending has been and will continue to be concentrated on this product 
research and development expenses increased from  in to  in the increase was principally due to i an increase in headcount from in to in in the research and development  manufacturing and medical departments  ii an increase in manufacturing supplies particularly for mntx  iii additional rent for new laboratory space as the we expanded our programs to incl ude mntx and  iv increased our spending on psma and hiv research programs 
general and administrative expenses include executive and administrative labor  professional fees  office rent and supplies 
general and administrative expenses remained unchanged at  in and  in the minimal decrease was principally due to a decrease in professional fees offset by an increase in operating expenses such as rent 
loss in joint venture increased from  in to  in the increase was primarily due to the growth and acceleration of the joint venture s development programs to develop in vivo immunotherapies for prostate cancer and the costs of licensing transactions 
we recognize our share of the jv s loss under the terms of the jv with cytogen corporation 
the increase in the jv loss was due to an increase in the headcount assigned to the psma project and the related cost of supplies 
additionally  prior to reaching the million thresehold  we recognized of the joint venture s research and development losses  that percentage was reduced to subsequent to reaching that threshold in december the level of future losses from the jv will be dependent upon the extent of research and development costs expended by the jv  the future financial position of the jv and the extension  if any  and terms of an amended services agreement 
the level of commitment by progenics and cytogen to fund the jv is based on a annual budget that is approved by the members 
as of march   the members were in the process of negotiating the annual budget for the jv and have committed to the jv that the operating budget for will be no less than the total expenses as set forth on the statement of operations for the jv for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization increased from  in to  in as we purchased capital assets and made leasehold improvements in to accommodate expansion 
other income expense interest income decreased from  in to  in as cash available for investing decreased and interest rates declined year over year 
during  we received a non recurring payment of  from bms in connection with the termination of the bms agreement see above 
as a result of the termination of the bms agreement  we will receive no additional payments from bms 
during  we received a  payment form an insurance settlement related to a heat excursion in our storage facility 
our net loss was  in compared to a net loss of  in years ended december  and revenues we recognized of revenue for research and development services performed for the psma development company  llc  our joint venture with cytogen corporation  the jv during and  in we were required to fund the first million of research and development costs and such amounts were recorded as capital contributions to the jv 
that million threshold was reached in the fourth quarter of other contract research and development revenue declined from  in to  in including funding received from bristol myers squibb company bms after the company and bms mutually terminated their collaboration agreement in may the company received  from bms in under the agreement and  in 
back to contents expenses research and development expenses increased from  in to  in the increase was principally due to an increase in headcount  related laboratory supplies and additional rent for new laboratory space as we expanded our research and development programs to include mntx methylnaltrexone in october general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in the increase was principally due to an increase in legal expenses related to our intellectual property filings and prosecutions  headcount and additional rent for new office space to accommodate growth 
loss in joint venture increased from  in to  in the increase was primarily due to the growth and acceleration of the joint venture s development programs to develop in vivo immunotherapies for prostate cancer and the costs of licensing transactions 
other income expense interest income decreased from  in to  in as cash available for investing remained relatively constant and interest rates decreased year over year 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in the decrease was principally due to the recognition of interest expense as we discounted future capital contributions to the joint venture that decreased in and reduced capital lease obligations in we also received a non recurring payment of approximately  from bms in connection with the termination of the bms agreement 
as a result of the termination of the bms agreement  we will receive no additional payments from bms 
our net loss was  in compared to a net loss of  in liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations since inception primarily through private placements of equity securities  loans that were subsequently converted into equity securities  a line of credit that was repaid and terminated  payments received under collaboration agreements  such as those with bms and roche  two public offerings of common stock  funding under government research grants and contracts  interest on investments  and the proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants 
in may  we and bms mutually agreed to terminate our cancer vaccine collaborative development agreement  pursuant to which we regained all rights to the products and received a non recurring payment of approximately  from bms 
as a result of the termination of the bms agreement  we will receive no additional payments from bms 
in  we received  in full settlement of an insurance claim 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including non current portion  totaling approximately million compared with approximately million at december  the cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared with million of cash provided by operations for the same period in the cash used in operations for the year ended december  resulted primarily from a net loss of million partially offset by depreciation and amortization of million 
the cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared with million of cash provided by investing activities for the same period in the cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the sale of million of marketable securities offset by the purchase of of marketable securities and the purchase of million of fixed assets including capital equipment and leasehold improvements as we acquired and built out additional research and development space 
we expect to spend about the same amount during to install a new bioreactor 
actual cash expended may decrease in as we are negotiating a lease line of credit to finance certain capital expenditures 

back to contents cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million as compared with million of cash provided by financing activities for the same period in the cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  reflects the exercise of stock options under the our employee stock option plans  the exercise of warrants and the sale of common stock under the employee stock purchase plans 
during  we expect that cash received from exercises under the above plans will increase due to increased headcount 
we are required to make capital contributions to fund of the current and future spending on the psma projects under the terms of the jv 
such amount was million during the level of commitment by progenics and cytogen  to fund the jv is based on a budget that is approved by both parties 
that budget is intended to be sufficient to fund research and development projects for the current year 
the budget must also consider the ability of the members to fund the jv 
during the first quarter of  each member contributed million to the jv 
as of march   the members were in the process of negotiating the annual budget for the jv and have committed to the jv that the operating budget for will be no less than the total expenses as set forth on the statement of operations for the jv for the year ended december  we provide services to the jv under a services agreement 
as of march   and through december   the company was performing services for the jv under a month to month extension of the services agreement 
at december   and through march   the members were negotiating the terms of a new services agreement 
for the year ended december   we recognized approximately  of contract research and development revenue for services performed on behalf of the jv 
a portion of these revenues is reimbursement for costs expended to outside parties 
beginning in  all costs to outside parties will be paid directly by the jv 
the level of future revenues from the jv will be dependent upon the extent of research and development services requested by the jv  the future financial position of the jv and the extension  if any  and terms of an amended services agreement 
our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  have been approximately million 
we currently have major research and development programs investigating cancer  symptom management and supportive care  and human immunodeficiency virus related diseases hiv  for which we are or have licensed technology and collaborated with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as academic institutions 
in addition  we are conducting several smaller research projects in the areas of virology and cancer 
for various reasons  many of which are outside of our control  including the early stage of our programs  the timing and results of our clinical trials and our dependence on third parties  we cannot estimate the total remaining costs to be incurred and timing to complete our research and development programs 
however  we expect to increase our spending on mntx to approximately million in for purchases of clinical supplies and the conduct of clinical trials 
spending on other programs is expected to remain relatively constant in for the years ended december   and  research and development costs incurred were as follows years ended december  in million cancer mntx hiv other programs 

total we have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 

back to contents we believe that our existing capital resources should be sufficient to fund operations beyond one year 
however  this is a forward looking statement based on our current operating plan and the assumptions on which it relies 
there could be changes that would consume our assets before such time 
we will require substantial funds to conduct research and development activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials and other activities relating to the commercialization of any potential products 
in addition  our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of results of research and development and product testing  changes in existing relationships with  or new relationships with  licensees  licensors or other collaborators  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims  the regulatory approval process  manufacturing and marketing and other costs associated with the commercialization of products following receipt of regulatory approvals and other factors 
we have no committed external sources of capital and  as discussed above  expect no significant product revenues for a number of years as it will take at least that much time  if ever  to bring our products to the commercial marketing stage 
we may seek additional financing  such as through future offerings of equity or debt securities or agreements with corporate partners and collaborators with respect to the development of our technology  to fund future operations 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   for future operating lease payments and payments for licensing  corporate collaboration and service agreements payments due by period total less than one year to years to years greater than years in millions operating leases licensing  collaboration and service agreements assumes attainment of milestones covered under each agreement 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue from contract research and development as we perform services  provided a contractual agreement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  and our collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
in situations where we receive payment in advance of the performance of services  these amounts are deferred and recognized as revenue as we perform the related services 
non refundable fees  including payments we receive for services  up front licensing fees and milestone payments are recognized as revenue based on the percentage of costs incurred to date  estimated costs to complete and total expected contract revenue 
however  the revenue we recognize is limited to the amount of non refundable fees received 
non refundable fees that we receive in consideration for granting collaborators the right to license product candidates developed by us are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the underlying agreements 
with regard to our revenues from non refundable fees  changes in estimates of our costs to complete could have a material impact on the revenues we recognize 
in connection with the formation of the equally owned jv  we have funded the first million of research and development costs incurred on behalf of the jv 
prior to reaching million of such costs  we recognized reimbursements on a net basis and did not recognize any revenue from the jv 
subsequent to having funded million of research and development costs  in the fourth quarter of  both members are required to fund the jv to support ongoing research and development efforts conducted by us on behalf of the jv 
accordingly  following million of funding  we  acting as a principal  recognize payments for research and development as revenue 
we are the primary obligor responsible for providing the service  by conducting research and development  desired by the jv  including the acceptability of the research and development services and we have established the amounts we will be reimbursed for the services by selecting the subcontractors and suppliers we employ in conducting the research and development for the jv 
changes in those factors may have a significant impact on the revenue that we recognize in the future 

back to contents for the year ended december   we recognized approximately  of contract research and development revenue for services performed on behalf of the jv 
a portion of these revenues was reimbursement for costs expended to outside parties 
beginning in  all costs to outside parties will be paid directly by the jv 
the level of future revenues from the jv will be dependent upon the extent of research and development services requested by the jv  the future financial position of the jv and the extension  if any  and terms of an amended services agreement 
the level of commitment by progenics and cytogen to fund the jv is based on an annual budget that is approved by both parties 
that budget is intended to be sufficient to fund research and development projects for the budget must also consider the ability of the members to fund the jv 
during the first quarter of  each member contributed million to the jv 
as of march   the members were in the process of negotiating the annual budget for the jv and have committed to the jv that the operating budget for will be no less than the total expenses as set forth on the statement of operations for the jv for the year ended december  clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses  which are included in research and development expenses  represent obligations resulting from our contracts with various clinical research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
such costs are expensed based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which the patients enter the trial and the period over which the clinical research organizations are expected to provide services 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended on a clinical trial with the expenses we record 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates
