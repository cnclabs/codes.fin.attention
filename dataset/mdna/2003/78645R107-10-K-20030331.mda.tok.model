item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for historical information contained herein  the statements in this item are forward looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  which may cause safenet s actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results 
those risks include  among others  risks associated with the receipt and timing of future customer orders  price pressures  achieving technical and product development milestones  the ability to negotiate favorable strategic oem agreements  sufficient cash flow to support safenet s liquidity requirements  other competitive factors leading to a decrease in anticipated revenues and gross profit margins and product development expenses 
overview safenet designs  manufactures and markets enterprise network security solutions using encryption technology 
our products are used in electronic commerce applications by financial institutions  government agencies and large corporations to secure data transmissions on private and public computer networks  such as the internet 
in january  we acquired securealink 
securealink develops  markets and sells security chips and intellectual property  primarily in europe and asia 
in february  management decided to discontinue our swiss operations at gds  which was formerly our european operations segment see note to the audited financial statements 
the operating results of the discontinued businesses has been reported in the discontinued operations section of the consolidated statement of operations 
the following comparisons of operating results focuses on the continuing operations of the company 
safenet s historical operating results have been dependent on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the length of the sales cycle  the timing of orders from and shipments to clients  product development expenses and the timing of development and introduction of new products 
our expense levels are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues 
the size and timing of our historical revenues have varied substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year 
accordingly  the results of a particular period  or period to period comparisons of recorded sales and profits may not be indicative of future operating results 
while management is committed to the long term profitability of safenet  the recent growth of the computer security industry has made it important that market share be obtained 
we have undertaken various strategies in order to increase our revenues and improve our future operating results  including new product offerings such as our safenet embeddedip and safenet soft remote 
management believes that growth in the market for products that provide secure remote access to computer networks requires safenet to increase its investment in development  sales and marketing activities to allow safenet to take advantage of this market opportunity and to achieve long term profitability  thereby maximizing shareholder value 
however  there can be no assurance that these strategies will be successful 
results of operations of safenet the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data of safenet as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december revenues cost of revenues gross profit research and development expenses sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses write off in in process research and development amortization of intangibles recovery of cyberguard advance total operating expenses operating loss income investment income and other expenses  net loss income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax benefit loss income from continuing operations the company has two reportable segments products  chips and software designed and manufactured for sale to companies that will embed the company s products into their products for ultimate sale to end users embedded security division  and network security products designed and manufactured for direct sales to end users and remote access software sold to oem s enterprise security division 
the segments are strategic business units that offer different products 
the segments are managed separately because each segment requires different technology and marketing strategies see note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
the acquisition of cylink in february  is expected to have a significant impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
since the transaction closed subsequent to december   the cylink acquisition has not been considered in the company s discussion of its results of operations and financial condition as of and for the year ended december  however  due to its significance to the company s business  a discussion of the cylink acquisition and its anticipated impact is included at the end of item management s discussion and analysis 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased  or  to  for the period ended december   from  in the embedded security division revenues increased or  due to the full year presence of the securealink acquisition for as well as increased revenue from our largest commercial customer 
the enterprise security division segment increased or  due to revenues earned under additional long term government contracts 
these contracts are the result of the government s approach to internet and communication security in light of the homeland security initiative 
gross margin remained consistent  for the period ended december   from in gross margins in the embedded security division decreased to in from in  due to the change in product mix with the addition of securealink delivering lower margin products 
enterprise security division margins increased to in from in based on increased customer base of higher margin customers as well changes in product mix with higher volumes in higher margin products such as license revenue 
research and development expenses increased  or  to  for the period ended december   from  in the increase is primarily related to the addition of the securealink business  with the main cost of that business being research and development costs 
research and development expenses for the embedded security division were focused on the next generation products chips  designed to be a very cost effective  high throughput  low power consuming chips in the tradition of safenet s other silicon products 
research and development expenses for the enterprise security division were focused on safenet s high assurance product line  including gateways  software  and other appliances 
some of these products were made available in with the remaining products coming to market in sales and marketing expenses increased  or  to  for the period ended december   from  in the additional expense reflects increased headcount  higher commissions from higher revenues  as well as additional promotional dollars spent on the branding of the securealink products and name 
as a percentage of revenues  the expenses were and in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  for the period ended december   from  in the increase is due to the additional office space obtained with the securealink acquisition  additional corporate employees  increased bonus expenses  and additional professional fees incurred related to new corporate governance requirements 
as a percentage of revenues  the expenses were in and the write off of acquired in process research and development assets  which totaled  for the year ended december   relates to the january acquisition of securealink 
this represents the estimated fair value of the in process research and development projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility at the acquisition date  and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately expensed at the acquisition date 
the value assigned to the acquired in process technology relates entirely to the development of a new application specific integrated circuit 
the estimated fair value of this project was determined by the use of a discounted cash flow model  using a discount rate that took into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization of the technology 
subsequent to the acquisition  the company incurred approximately  in additional research and development charges to complete the development of the technology  which was licensed to a customer during fiscal year amortization of intangible assets  which totaled  for the year ended december   also relates to the january acquisition of securealink 
intangible assets  which consist primarily of developed technology and patents  are amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from one to five years 
investment income and other expenses decreased by  to  for the period ended december   from  in investment income and other expenses decreased primarily due to lower interest rates throughout as compared to for the year ended december   the company incurred operating losses  however  the company also experienced an income tax benefit related to the amortization of acquired intangibles from the securealink acquisition 
for the year ended december   the company incurred operating losses and therefore  did not record income tax expense 
the company s income tax benefit related to these losses has been offset by a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets since the company s ability to use the remaining net operating loss carryforward is dependent upon future taxable income 
the company had a loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended december  compared to a loss from continuing operations of  for the same period in the loss from continuing operations per common share was in compared to loss from continuing per common share of in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues decreased  or  to  for the period ended december   from  in the embedded security division revenues decreased or  due to the adverse impact of the economic slowdown on customers  causing them to delay purchases of software licenses and upgrades  and accelerator boards 
the enterprise security division segment decreased or  primarily due to delayed purchases of safenet s vpn products from government customers in the wake of the september th tragedy 
gross margin decreased to for the period ended december   from in the company recorded additional inventory reserves related primarily to legacy products with diminishing future demand 
these additional reserves aggregated  in the second quarter of and negatively impacted gross margins by 
for the year  the additional inventory reserves affected the embedded and enterprise segments by  and  respectively  impacting gross margins by  and  respectively 
gross margins in the embedded security division increased to in from in  due to increased royalty revenues earned on chip sales and license fees associated with intellectual property sales 
enterprise security division margins decreased to from based primarily on the change in product mix to include a lesser amount of higher margin software sales 
research and development expenses decreased  or  to  for the period ended december   from  in the decrease is primary related to lower external development costs of chip fabrication 
sales and marketing expenses increased  or  to  for the period ended december   from  in the additional expense reflects management s focus on increasing sales and marketing resources in new markets 
additional expenses include the costs associated with new employees and expanded marketing programs such as the safenet secure tour and two trade shows 
as a percentage of revenues  the expenses were and in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or  to  for the period ended december   from  in the decrease is due to cost saving measures including staff reductions  reductions in performance based compensation  travel expenses  and professional fees 
as a percentage of revenues  the expenses were and of revenues in and  respectively 
interest income and other expenses increased by  to  for the period ended december   from  in interest income remained steady despite declining interest rates in due to larger average cash and short term investment holdings throughout compared to for the year ended december   the company has incurred operating losses and therefore  did not record income tax expense 
the company s income tax benefit related to these losses has been offset by a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets since the company s ability to use the remaining net operating loss carryforward is dependent upon future taxable income 
for the year ended december   the company did not recognize income tax expense due to the reversal of the valuation allowance on net operating loss carryforwards available to offset earnings 
the company had a loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended december  compared to income from continuing operations of  for the same period in the loss from continuing operations per common share was in compared to diluted income from continuing per common share of in liquidity and capital resources safenet believes that its current cash resources will be sufficient to meet its needs for the next year 
as of december   safenet had working capital of  including cash and short term investments of in january  as partial consideration for the acquisition of securealink  safenet paid  in cash and issued contingent convertible promissory notes  which were paid in may  in the aggregate amount of  additionally  after closing of the acquisition in january  safenet advanced to securealink approximately  in order to repay securealink s line of credit 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in february  safenet management decided to discontinue operations at gds based on the amount of gds operating and cash losses during and as well as a significant downturn in future business prospects 
gds suffered cash losses of  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
management s decision to discontinue operations at gds positively impacted cash flows in in  cash and short term investments increased  the increase was mainly attributable to cash provided by operating activities of  cash used in investing activities during included investments in computer software development costs and equipment totaling  and cash paid for securealink was  net of cash required 
cash provided by financing activities in included  from the exercise of stock options 
safenet has expended and will continue to expend portions of its operating cash for acquisition and integration costs related to acquisitions 
the cylink acquisition expended  for acquisition costs in and  for integration costs in we expect the cash outflow to be significant in as we integrate cylink throughout the majority of actual cash outflows for the cylink integration and acquisition for through february were  the raqia acquisition will also require cash outflows  including  through february there will also be additional investments made into the acquired technology from the raqia acquisition in we estimated the integration costs for cylink and raqia during to be  and  respectively 
we estimate the acquisition costs for cylink and raqia during to be  and  respectively 
safenet believes that its current cash resources will be sufficient to meet its needs for the next year 
inflation and seasonality safenet does not believe that inflation will significantly impact its business 
we do not believe our business is seasonal 
however  because we generally recognize product revenues upon shipment and software revenues upon establishing fair value of undelivered elements  recognition may be irregular and uneven  thereby disparately impacting quarterly operating results and balance sheet comparisons 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
statement no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit plan 
costs covered by statement no 
include one time termination benefits and certain contract termination costs  including operating lease termination costs that are associated with an exit or disposal activity 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in this note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
safenet believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
safenet senior management has discussed each of these critical accounting policies with the company s audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts safenet maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company calculates its allowance based on a specific analysis of past due balances and also considers historical trends of write offs 
if the financial condition of safenet s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory safenet provides for its estimated inventory obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
the company utilizes projected sales by product to determine the net realizable value of the inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
software development costs safenet calculates amortization of its capitalized software development costs based on the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product including the period being reported on 
in addition  safenet assesses the recoverability of software development costs by comparing the unamortized balance to the net realizable value of the asset and writes off the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the net realizable value 
these calculations require management to make assumptions about future demand for its products  future revenues to be generated from the sale of its products  as well as the estimated useful lives of developed technology 
if actual market conditions or product demand is different from those assumptions  or if changes in technology limit the useful life of safenet s core technology  additional amortization or write downs may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets safenet accounts for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting 
a portion of the purchase prices for these businesses is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on estimated fair values at the dates of acquisitions 
any excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill 
the identified intangible assets include patents  developed technology  purchase orders  contract backlog and acquired in process research and development assets 
research and development assets are written off at the date of acquisition in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
the fair values were determined by management  generally based upon information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and valuations prepared by independent valuation experts 
the valuations have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
for certain classes of intangible assets  the valuations have been based upon estimated cost of replacement 
the assigned useful lives  which range from one to five years  are based upon periods of estimated cash flows and other factors 
if safenet used different assumptions and estimates in the calculation of the fair value of identified intangible assets and the estimation of the related useful lives  the amounts allocated to these assets  as well as the related amortization expense  would have been significantly different than the amounts recorded 
effective january   safenet adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under statement  goodwill is no longer amortized but is reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value using impairment testing methodology in statement indicators of potential impairment include operating losses  loss of a significant customer and adverse industry developments 
the first annual impairment test for goodwill  all of which was assigned to the embedded security division  was performed on october  the impairment test was based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the embedded security division to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities allocated to that division 
the fair values used in this evaluation were estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections for the division as well as comparable revenue and earnings multiples 
in order to project future cash flows  management made a number of assumptions concerning such things as future sales volume levels  future price levels  and rates of increase in operating expenses 
since the estimated fair value of the division exceeded the carrying value of the recorded net assets  no impairment was identified or recorded 
however  if safenet used different assumptions and estimates in the calculation of the fair value of the division  an impairment of goodwill could have been identified 
revenue recognition safenet derives revenue from software and technology licenses  product sales  maintenance and other services 
software and technology licenses contain multiple elements  including the product license  maintenance and or other services 
the recognition of revenue under these arrangements requires management to make judgments about the likelihood of granting future concessions and the ultimate collectibility of fees 
revenues that are earned under long term contracts to develop high assurance encryption technology are recognized using contract accounting 
under contract accounting  revenue from these arrangements is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
progress to completion is measured using contract milestones 
accounting for these contracts requires the estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each milestone and each contract 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  then future margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to the company s results of operations 
significant business acquisition subsequent to december  in february  safenet completed its acquisition of cylink 
operations of cylink were integrated into the enterprise security division of safenet and function as part of that business unit 
this acquisition will have a significant impact on the company s business operations going forward 
see item business significant business acquisition subsequent to december the results of cylink s business operations will be included in the company s consolidated financial statements from february  forward 
the aggregate purchase price for cylink was approximately million  consisting primarily of  shares of common stock valued at million   options and warrants assumed with an aggregate value of million  and estimated direct costs of the acquisition of million 
the company is in the process of obtaining third party valuations on this acquisition and the assets included 
on february   the company filed a form k related to the acquisition of cylink 
the company will file an k a on or about april  that will include historical audited financial statements of the acquired company and unaudited pro forma financial information 
see footnote in notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of financial instruments 
safenet is exposed to financial market risks  primarily related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
safenet currently does not have any derivative financial instruments to protect against adverse currency movements 
safenet manages its exposure to market risks related to operations through regular operating and financing activities 
all of the potential impacts noted below are based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of december  actual results may differ materially safenet derives approximately of its revenues from customers outside of the us this business is transacted primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary located in the netherlands that operates using the euro as the functional currency 
expenses are also incurred in euros to match the subsidiary s revenues and minimize exposure of operating margins to exchange rate fluctuations 
a hypothetical adverse change in the average euro exchange rate would have decreased net operating income in by approximately  safenet views the investment in this subsidiary as long term 
the effect of a change in the euro exchange rate on the net investment in the foreign subsidiary is reflected in other comprehensive income loss 
a depreciation in the euro relative to the us dollar would result in a decrease in consolidated stockholders equity at december  of approximately  at december  and  safenet did not have any interest bearing obligations 
in addition  safenet does not hold any derivative instruments and does not have any commodity market risk
