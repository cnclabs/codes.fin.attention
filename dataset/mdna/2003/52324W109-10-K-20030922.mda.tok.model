for a discussion on forward looking statements  see the information set forth at the end of this item under the heading forward looking statements 
lecroy currently operates as one business segment in the test and measurement instrument market 
using our core competency of waveshape analysis  defined as the capture and analysis of complex electronic signals  we develop  manufacture  sell and license signal acquisition and analysis products 
our principal product line consists of a family of high performance digital oscilloscopes used primarily by electrical design engineers in various markets  including computer semi conductor  data storage  communications and power measurement 
we also produce modular digitizers and proprietary electronic components 
in addition  we generate revenue by providing service on all of our products beyond the initial warranty period 
consolidated results of operations the following table indicates the percentage of total revenues represented by each item in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june   and on august   we sold substantially all of the assets and business of our vigilant networks business segment

revenues from digital oscilloscopes and related products decreased  or million  in fiscal lower sales from discontinued product lines  oem distributed products and components were partially offset by sales of our application specific serial data analyzer and disk drive analyzer versions of our high end wavemaster tm product line of digital oscilloscopes and increased sales of probes and accessory products 
revenues from high energy physics products declined by million  or  in fiscal as a result of our decision in december to discontinue this product line

included in cost of sales in fiscal is a million of total revenues charge for severance and a charge of million of total revenues to increase our allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
this inventory charge relates to the cost of inventory associated with discontinued product lines and inventory levels that had been deemed to be in excess of forecasted requirements 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal resulted from the million technology license included in service and other revenue  favorable margins on our high end wavemaster product line of digital oscilloscopes  more favorable product margins on the existing base of products due to higher average selling prices of our high end products  increased operational efficiency and improved cost structure 
selling  general and administrative expense increased by  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal includes million of severance of total revenues charges and million of total revenues of plant closing costs partially offset by the reversal of an unused restructuring reserve of million of total revenues and in fiscal includes of million of severance of total revenues charges 
this increase in selling  general and administrative expense is attributable to increased fixed selling costs as a result of the conversion  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  of the us sales force from partial coverage by manufacturers representatives to full coverage by our direct sales force  establishing a direct presence in singapore  the opening of two new offices in china partially offset by lower restructuring charges in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expense was in fiscal  compared with in fiscal this increase as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to our inability to leverage higher costs of fixed infrastructure over the lower sales base 
research and development expense decreased by  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal included in research and development in fiscal and are severance charges of million and million and of total revenues  respectively  and in fiscal a million of total revenues technology access fee to ibm corporation ibm 
we will use the access to this next generation silicon germanium technology acquired from ibm to develop components that are expected to deliver higher density  greater speed and reduced power consumption than those currently available 
such components will be used in future high speed digital oscilloscopes 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expense decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due the technology access fee purchased in fiscal partially offset by increased severance charges and the inability to fully leverage expenses over the lower sales base in fiscal despite the effects of the difficult economy  we maintained our commitment to product development in fiscal as evidenced by the successful execution of our product strategy of leveraging our high end silicon germanium acquisition technology and maui instrument operating system deployed in wavemaster into our wavepro product line of digital oscilloscopes 
we intend to continue to invest a significant percentage of our revenues in our research and development efforts 
other expense income  net  which consists primarily of net interest income and foreign exchange gains or losses  was an expense of million in fiscal  compared to income of million in fiscal the decrease in income in fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in foreign exchange losses on transactions denominated in other than the functional currency of lecroy or our subsidiaries and lower net interest income earned on our cash balances due to lower interest rates 
in fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit of million  or an effective tax rate of  compared to a tax benefit of million  or an effective tax rate of  in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was based on an estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately  increased by the release of a million tax reserve related to a favorable audit settlement in the first quarter of fiscal charges related to convertible preferred stock  comprising the preferred stock dividend and the accretion for the value of fully exercisable warrants granted in connection with the private placement of the preferred stock  were million and million in fiscal and  respectively

comparison of fiscal years and total revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of  or million 
revenues from digital oscilloscopes and related products decreased  or million  in fiscal primarily due to the impact of the difficult economic environment on our higher end products and execution issues in our us sales channel 
revenues from high energy physics products declined by million  or  in fiscal as a result of our decision in december to discontinue this product line 
service and other revenue in both fiscal and includes the recognition of million of revenue that was deferred with the adoption of the securities and exchange commission s sab revenue recognition in financial statements as of the beginning of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on a geographical basis  the americas comprised million  or  of fiscal revenues compared to million  or  of fiscal  europe and the middle east comprised million  or  of fiscal revenues compared to million  or  of fiscal and the asia pacific region accounted for million  or  of fiscal revenues compared to million  or  of fiscal the decline in revenues from the americas in fiscal was primarily due to the impact of the difficult economic environment in the us and execution issues in our us sales channel 
we addressed these execution issues in the fourth quarter of fiscal by hiring new sales management and converting the us sales channel from partial coverage by manufacturers sales representatives to full coverage by our direct sales force 
gross margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal included in cost of sales in fiscal was million of total revenues of severance charges and a million of total revenues charge for excess and obsolete inventory 
this inventory charge relates to the cost of inventory associated with discontinued product lines and inventory levels that had been deemed to be in excess of forecasted requirements 
included in cost of sales in fiscal was million of total revenues of severance charges 
the decrease in gross margin from the prior year was due to the unfavorable absorption of costs resulting from lower sales volume  an unfavorable sales mix of lower margin products and higher technology related royalties  in addition to the charges for severance and excess and obsolete inventory in fiscal these negative impacts were partially offset by favorable margins on our new high end wavemaster product line of digital oscilloscopes released in the third quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expense decreased by  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal included in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal is million of total revenues of severance charges and in fiscal is million of total revenues of severance charges partially offset by the reversal of an unused restructuring reserve of million of total revenues 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense is attributable to the cost reduction initiatives taken in light of the poor economic environment including headcount reductions  salary freezes  reduced incentive payments and controls on discretionary spending  as well as lower variable selling costs partially offset by the increase in severance charges in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expense was in fiscal  compared with in fiscal this increase as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to the inability to leverage the costs of fixed infrastructure over the lower sales base and the increase in severance charges in fiscal these fixed costs increased in fiscal as a result of the conversion  in the fourth quarter  of the us sales force from partial coverage by manufacturers representatives to full coverage by the our direct sales force 
research and development expense increased by  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal included in research and development in fiscal and are severance related charges of million and million and of total revenues  respectively  and in fiscal a million of total revenues technology access fee to ibm 
despite the effects of the difficult economy  we maintained our commitment to product development in fiscal as evidenced by the successful launch of wavemaster  our first silicon germanium based family of oscilloscopes 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expense increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to the inability to leverage expenses fully over the lower sales base  the purchased technology and the release of our high end wavemaster product line of digital oscilloscopes in the third quarter of fiscal we intend to continue to invest a significant percentage of our revenues in our research and development efforts 
other expense income  net  which consists of net interest income and foreign exchange gains or losses  was income of million in fiscal  compared to an expense of million in fiscal the increase in income was due to a million reduction of foreign exchange losses as a result of our hedging program initiated in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  there was a million improvement in net interest income due to higher average cash balances from the net proceeds of million raised from a private equity placement in august and no significant bank borrowings during fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold the remaining million shares of our equity investment in iwatsu 
this transaction generated million of cash and resulted in a pre tax loss of million 
no shares of iwatsu stock were sold during fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit of million  or an effective tax rate of  compared to a tax benefit of million  or an effective tax rate of  in fiscal the effective tax rate consists of our annual effective tax rate increased by the release of a million tax reserve related to a favorable audit settlement 
during fiscal  we used million of net operating losses million of tax benefit to offset taxable income from continuing operations and reversed  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  million of our valuation allowance into income 
partially offsetting these items  we recorded a tax expense of million for the projected repatriation of cash from one of our foreign subsidiaries 
our tax provision in fiscal before the tax benefit from net operating losses and the reversal of our valuation allowance  partially offset by the tax expense for the projected cash repatriation from one of our foreign subsidiaries  would have been million  or an effective tax rate of

vigilant networks principal product  the big tangerine network analyzer  was a new product which was also being sold into a new market for lecroy 
since this product s inception  we had made substantial investments in the vigilant networks business segment in terms of selling  marketing  research and development and administrative expenses 
while the network analyzer had a unique technology  we decided that we could not continue to invest the financial resources necessary to capitalize on its future growth potential 
in august  we closed the sale of the assets and business of vigilant and a portion of the assets and business of digitech for gross proceeds of million 
the remaining business of digitech was classified as discontinued operations 
the buyer also assumed certain liabilities of vigilant 
in connection with the sale  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of lecroy common stock at per share to the buyer 
using the black scholes option pricing model  these warrants were valued at approximately million 
after deducting the value of these warrants  along with fees and certain retained liabilities  we recorded a loss of million  net of a million tax benefit  on the sale and discontinuance of the vigilant networks business segment 
this includes a million adjustment to the loss recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to changes in estimates 
fiscal revenues from discontinued operations were million through the measurement date and losses from discontinued operations  net of tax  were million through the measurement date

the increase in cash used in operating activities in fiscal versus was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable balances related to lower revenue and improved collections experience on past due balances 
the reduction in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities in fiscal reflects million of payments on retained discontinued operations liabilities  severance payments and a reduction in accounts payable levels 
net cash used in provided by investing activities for the fiscal years ended june   and was million  million and million  respectively 
this increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal versus was primarily due to a million acquisition of a technology license partially offset by a million reduction in capital expenditures in fiscal and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of million in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal versus was primarily due to the gross proceeds of million received from the sale of the assets and business of the vigilant networks business segment in fiscal  which effect was partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of million in fiscal and the investment of million in computer software in fiscal net cash provided by used in financing activities for the fiscal years ended june   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal versus was primarily due to the private equity placement in fiscal raising net proceeds of million 
additionally  fewer stock options were exercised during fiscal due to a lower average stock price as compared to fiscal the increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal versus was primarily due to the net proceeds of million raised from the private equity placement in fiscal we have a million revolving line of credit with a commercial bank expiring on september   which can be used to provide funds for general corporate purposes and acquisitions 
borrowings under this line bear interest at prime plus a margin of between

this revolving line of credit is secured by a lien on substantially all of our domestic assets 
as of june   we have met our financial covenant requirements and there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit 
the credit agreement was amended on september  to extend the expiration date of the revolving line of credit to november  management plans to complete its negotiations and have a new revolving line of credit in place before this amendment expires

we believe that our cash on hand and cash flow generated by our continuing operations will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and provide funds for potential acquisition opportunities 
summary of critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
these estimates and assumptions are based on management s judgment and available information and  consequently  actual results could be different from these estimates 
lecroy believes that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve significant management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related assets  liability  revenue and expense amounts 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts relating to the portion of the accounts receivable which we estimate is non collectable 
we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which includes the allowance for anticipated returns  was million at june  and changes in the overall economic environment or in the financial condition of our customers may require adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory lecroy provides an allowance for estimated excess and obsolete levels of inventory equal to the lower of the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based on assumptions relating to future demand and market conditions 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at june  and june   respectively 
if actual market conditions prove less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets the carrying values of long lived assets and identifiable amortizable intangibles including technology  manufacturing and distribution rights are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying values of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amounts exceed the fair value 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance of lecroy relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the cost of technology  manufacturing and distribution rights acquired is amortized primarily on the basis of the higher of units shipped over the contract periods or on a straight line basis 
management assesses the recoverability of these rights on the basis of actual and forecasted production units as well as the average selling price and standard costs of the related products after the amortization of the rights to determine profitability 
if required  an impairment charge is recorded 
goodwill statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually under a two step approach  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value based test 
a reporting unit is defined as the same as or one level below the operating segment level as described in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the first step is to identify if an impairment of goodwill has occurred by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in this second step  the implied fair value as defined in sfas no 
of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
we completed the annual impairment test required under sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that there was no impairment to our recorded goodwill balance of million at june  deferred tax assets we have recorded million of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of june  for the future tax benefit of certain expenses reported for financial statement purposes that have not yet been deducted on our tax returns 
significant components of our deferred tax assets are federal  state and foreign loss and credit carryforwards  inventory reserves and other reserves 
the recognition of this deferred tax asset is based on the assessment that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income within statutory carryforward periods to realize the benefit of these tax deductions 
the factors that management considers in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
based on this information  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of june  to reserve for those tax assets we believe are not likely to be realized in future periods 
adjustments to the valuation allowance may be made in the future if it is determined that the realized amount of net operating losses and other deferred tax assets is greater or less than the amount recorded 
warranty provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are derived from historical data of product reliability 
the expected failure is arrived at in terms of units  which are then converted into labor hours to which an average fully burdened cost per hour is applied to derive the amount of accrued warranty required 
on a quarterly basis  we study trends of warranty claims and take action to improve the quality of our products and minimize our warranty exposure 
the warranty reserve was million at june  and management believes that the warranty reserve is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve which would be charged or credited to the consolidated statement of operations 
revenue recognition in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which summarizes certain of the sec staff s views in applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to revenue recognition in financial statements 
under sab  which we adopted in fiscal  certain previously recognized license fee revenue was deferred and recognized in future periods over the terms of the agreements 
the adoption of sab was recorded as of the beginning of fiscal and resulted in a non cash charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change of million  net of a tax benefit of million 
the deferred revenue will be amortized into revenue over years  the remaining terms of the license agreements 
we recognized pre tax deferred license fee revenue of million during fiscal years  and such license fees were included in service and other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of june   the remaining balance of pre tax deferred license fee revenue was million 
we recognize software license revenue in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position sop  modifications of sop with respect to certain transactions 
revenues from perpetual software license agreements are recognized upon shipment of the software if evidence of an arrangement exists  pricing is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
if an acceptance period is required  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
we allocate revenue on software arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we analyze all of the elements and determine if there is sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to maintenance included in multiple element arrangements 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  where the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
the revenue allocated to licenses generally is recognized upon delivery of the products 
the revenue allocated to maintenance is generally recognized ratably over the term of the support 
in accordance with sop  we recognized million of revenue for the perpetual license of our maui instrument operating system technology in fiscal maintenance fees included in the license agreement will be recognized pro rata for each year of maintenance purchased

forward looking statements this form k may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including without limitation  statements regarding the intent  belief or current expectations of lecroy or its directors or officers with respect to  among other things  i market trends in our industries and the projected impact on lecroy  ii the increasing importance of signal shape analysis  iii our ability to meet our customers evolving needs  iv our position within our industries and our ability to compete effectively  v our ability to expand into new markets  vi the success of our new product introductions  vii trends in the seasonality of our sales  viii a shift in technology towards higher speed digital signals containing more complex data and the demands of users of signal analyzer products  ix market opportunities for dedicated signal analyzers  x the resolution of certain environmental remediation activities  xi the sufficiency of our cash balances  cash flow and the availability of external financing sources to fund working capital  capital expenditure requirements and business or technology acquisitions  xii trends affecting our financial condition and results of operations  xiii our business and growth strategies  xiv the impact of adoption of accounting pronouncements  xv the tektronix  inc  litigation including the potential costs and outcome of that litigation  as well as other estimates relating to future operations  and xvi certain other statements identified or qualified by words such as likely  will  suggests  may  would  could  should  expects  intends  anticipates  estimates  plans  projects  believes  is optimistic about  or similar expressions and variants of such words or expressions 
investors are cautioned that forward looking statements are inherently uncertain 
these forward looking statements represent our best judgment as of the date of this form k  and we caution readers not to place undue reliance on such statements 
actual performance and results of operations may differ materially from those projected or suggested in the forward looking statements due to certain risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  risks associated with fluctuations in our operating results  volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  competitive factors  including pricing pressure  technological developments and products offered by competitors  our ability to deliver a timely flow of competitive new products and market acceptance of these products  our ability to anticipate changes in the market  our ability to negotiate or maintain financing arrangements with lenders on terms that are acceptable  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  including our management  changes in the global economy and fluctuations in foreign currency rates  inventory risks due to changes in market demand or our business strategies  risks due to an interruption in supply or an increase in price for our parts  components and sub assemblies  our ability to realize sufficient margins on the sales of our products  the development of future products and our ability to use intellectual property and protect our patent portfolio  those risks listed under the heading risk factors that may impact future results and in other cautionary statements in this document  as well as other risk factors listed from time to time in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission and press releases 
the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events 
risk factors that may impact future results in addition to other information in this form k and any information incorporated by reference in this form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating lecroy and our business 
also  readers should carefully review our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission and press releases 
investing in our securities involves a degree of risk 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely impact our business 
if any of the risks described actually occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity would likely suffer and the price of our securities could fall 
our operating results and financial condition could continue to be harmed if the industries into which we sell products remain depressed 
the economic downturn has resulted in reduced purchasing and capital spending in many of the markets that we serve worldwide 
in particular  the computer semi conductor  data storage  communications and power measurements markets have been in a downward cycle characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and the increasing erosion of average selling prices 
although some segments of these industries have shown recent signs of stabilization  others  especially communications  continue to exhibit a downward cycle 
demand in these markets remains volatile so the underlying trend is uncertain 
we are uncertain how long the current downturn will last and when a sustained recovery in these markets may occur  if ever 
any further decline in customers markets or in the general economic conditions would likely result in a further reduction in demand for our products and would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  if customers markets continue to decline  we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us 
such further decline could harm our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price  and could limit our ability to reach goals for restoring profitability 
finally  we may be required to secure additional debt or equity financing at some time in the future  and cannot be assured that such financing will be available on acceptable terms when required 
if demand for our products does not match manufacturing capacity  earnings may continue to suffer 
we cannot immediately adapt production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions 
when demand does not meet expectations  manufacturing capacity will likely exceed production requirements 
the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity may adversely affect our earnings 
conversely  if during a market upturn we cannot increase manufacturing capacity to meet product demand  we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner  which in turn may have a negative effect on earnings and our overall business 
the actions we took in response to the reduced demand for our products and services could have long term adverse effects on our business 
there are several risks inherent in our cost cutting initiatives to transition to a reduced cost structure 
these include the risk that we will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough and sustain them at a level necessary to restore profitability  and that we may have to undertake further restructuring initiatives that would entail additional charges 
in addition  there is the risk that cost cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop and market products effectively and remain competitive in the industries in which we compete 
cost reduction measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products  making it more difficult for us to respond to customers  limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel 
these circumstances could cause our earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be 
we rely on several single source suppliers 
we obtain certain parts  components and sub assemblies from single sources 
this has particularly been the case with several key integrated circuits made by certain single source suppliers 
alternative sources of supply for integrated circuits would be particularly difficult to develop over a short period of time 
an interruption in supply or an increase in price for our parts  components and sub assemblies could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition could reduce our market share and harm our business 
the market for signal acquisition and analysis products such as our high performance digital oscilloscopes is highly competitive 
our principal competitors in this market are tektronix  inc tektronix and agilent technologies 
some of our principal competitors have substantially greater sales and marketing  development and financial resources than we do 
we believe that each of these companies offers a wide range of products that attempt to address most segments of the digital oscilloscope market 
we believe that the principal factors of competition in the signal acquisition and analysis market are a product s performance  including its bandwidth  sample rate  record length  and processing power  a product s price and quality  the vendor s name recognition  reputation  product availability  and availability and quality of post sale support 
if any of our competitors surpass us or are perceived to have surpassed us with respect to one or more of these factors  we may lose customers 
our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain and develop the advanced technology used in our signal acquisition and analysis products  as well as our ability to offer high performance products at a favorable price to performance ratio 
although we believe that we currently compete effectively with respect to each of the principal bases of competition in the signal acquisition and analysis market in the  to  general price range in which our high performance digital oscilloscopes are focused  we cannot assure you that we will continue to compete effectively 
without the timely introduction of competitive products  our products will become technologically obsolete over time 
we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products  services and enhancements  our products will become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer 
the success of new product offerings will depend on several factors  including our ability to identify customer needs properly  innovate and develop new technologies  manufacture and deliver products in sufficient volumes on time  differentiate offerings from competitors offerings  price products competitively and anticipate competitors development of new products or technological innovations 
we depend upon key personnel and qualified future hires to implement our expansion strategy 
our success depends on the efforts and abilities of senior management and key employees in the sales  marketing  research and development  and manufacturing areas 
many of these employees would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment contracts with most of our key personnel and our continued low stock price means that many of our outstanding employee stock options are under water or have an exercise price above the current market price of our common stock 
in addition  lecroy s stock option plan expired on january  this means we are currently unable to grant any stock options to employees  which historically was a way for us to compensate and provide incentives to our employees 
if we cannot retain existing key managers and employ additional qualified senior employees  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
future expansion of operations will require us to attract  train  and retain new personnel 
these factors could increase our operating expenses 
if we are unable to recruit or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  or the costs of compensation or employee benefits increase substantially  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we may not be successful in protecting our intellectual and proprietary rights 
our success substantially depends upon our technology and products 
we rely on patent and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
any infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights and the related costs of enforcing those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may infringe upon other parties proprietary rights 
our business activities may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  who may assert infringement claims against us 
such claims and any resultant litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages  might result in invalidation of our proprietary rights and  even if not meritorious  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
we could be affected by government regulation and other legal uncertainties 
we manufacture our products in the united states  and sell our products and purchase parts  components and sub assemblies in a number of countries 
we are therefore subject to legal and regulatory requirements  particularly the imposition of tariffs  customs and export controls  in a variety of countries 
in addition  the export of high performance digital oscilloscopes from the united states is subject to regulation under the treaty for nuclear non proliferation 
our stock price may be volatile in the future 
the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly 
the stock price could fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include announcements of developments related to our business  announcements of technological innovations or new products or enhancements by us or our competitors  sales by competitors  including sales to our customers  sales of common stock into the public market  including by directors and members of management  developments in our relationship with our customers  partners  distributors  and suppliers  shortfalls or changes in revenue  gross margins  earnings or losses  or other financial results from analysts expectations  regulatory developments  fluctuations in results of operations  trends in the seasonality of our sales  and general conditions in our market or the markets served by our customers 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general and the market for shares of technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
we cannot ensure that the market price of our common stock will not decline substantially  or otherwise continue to experience significant fluctuations in the future  including fluctuations that are unrelated to our operating performance 
if our operating results do not improve in the long term we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate whether our deferred tax assets can be realized and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 
an additional valuation allowance would be recorded if it were more likely than not that some or all of our net deferred tax assets would not be realized before they expire 
if we establish additional valuation allowances we might record a tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations which would have an adverse impact on our operating performance 
if we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense  our net income and earnings per share would be significantly reduced 
there has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options 
currently we record compensation expense only in connection with option grants that have an exercise price below fair value 
it is possible that future laws and regulations will require us to record the fair value of all stock options as compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations which would have an adverse impact on our operating performance 
we are party to a license agreement with punitive change of control provisions 
in february  we settled litigation with tektronix involving allegations that our digital oscilloscope products infringed certain patents held by tektronix 
as part of the settlement  we entered into a license agreement with respect to such patents 
pursuant to the license agreement we made royalty payments to tektronix totaling million and received a worldwide  nonexclusive license under the applicable patents 
the license agreement provides that tektronix may terminate the license in the event that we acquire or more of the stock of  or a controlling interest in  any of a number of specified companies participating in the oscilloscope market or any of their respective affiliates each  a restricted company  any restricted company acquires or more of the stock of  or a controlling interest in  us or an affiliate of ours  or we attempt to transfer the tektronix license to a restricted company  and do not first obtain tektronix s prior written consent 
this provision of the license agreement could preclude us from making an investment in or acquisition of such companies 
it could also discourage such companies or other third parties from attempting to acquire control of us or limit the price that such parties might be willing to pay for our common stock 
in addition  this provision could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
the license agreement provides that the license will automatically terminate when all of the applicable patents expire on september  once the license terminates  lecroy will not suffer any negative consequences under the terms of the license agreement as a result of any of the above mentioned investments or acquisitions 
we have adopted anti takeover provisions that could affect the market price of our stock or our ability to sell our business 
our certificate of incorporation  by laws  and stockholders rights plan  as well as the provisions of the tektronix license agreement described above  contain anti takeover provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
pursuant to the provisions contained in our bylaws  certificate of incorporation and stockholder rights plan  we can issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
our board of directors can eliminate the right of our stockholders to act by written consent and our board of directors can impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for our stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we purchase materials from suppliers and sell our products around the world and maintain investments in foreign subsidiaries  all denominated in a variety of currencies 
as a consequence  we are exposed to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to a number of currencies  changes in government policies and legal and regulatory requirements  political instability  transportation delays and the imposition of tariffs and export controls 
among the more significant potential risks to lecroy of relative fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is the relationship among and between the united states dollar  the european monetary unit  swiss franc  british pound  japanese yen  korean won and singapore dollar 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we began a program of entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the risks associated with currency fluctuations on assets or liabilities denominated in other than the functional currency of lecroy or its subsidiaries 
it cannot be assured  however  that this program will effectively offset all of our foreign currency risk related to these assets or liabilities 
other than this program  we do not attempt to reduce our foreign currency exchange risks by entering into foreign currency management programs 
as a consequence  there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future as a result of mismatches between local currency revenues and expenses  the translation of foreign currencies into the us dollar  our financial reporting currency  or otherwise  will not adversely affect our results of operations 
moreover  fluctuations in exchange rates could affect the demand for our products 
during fiscal  and  foreign currency exchange losses on assets or liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies  net of gains or losses on related foreign exchange forward contracts  approximated million  million  and million  respectively 
these net losses in fiscal  and include gross gains of million  million and million 
at june  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of open foreign exchange forward contracts all with maturities of three months or less 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign exchange forward contracts and our assets or liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies 
in management s opinion  a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on these instruments or  therefore  our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates primarily due to our investment in cash and cash equivalents 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates  which would not have been significant to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows
