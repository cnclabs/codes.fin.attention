table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
in general  any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section e 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
investors should be aware that such forward looking statements are intended to provide management s current expectations for the future operating and financial performance of the company based on assumptions believed to be valid at the time 
thus  such expectations are inherently subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from those reflected in forward looking statements 
in addition to general economic conditions and market trends  some of the important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include  but are not limited to  the following a major downturn of the united states or european automotive markets although lydall s automotive sales are not solely contingent on the strength of the automotive market  a significant downturn of the united states or european automotive industries could have a substantial impact on lydall s results 
the company can also be affected when automotive manufacturers discontinue production of specific models that contain lydall s products 
conversely  lydall benefits from the introduction of new models that contain the company s products 
approximately percent of lydall s total net sales in were to the automotive market 
lydall s automotive products are thermal and acoustical barriers employed both inside and under the body of vehicles 
most of lydall s products are supplied to meet unique  niche applications 
lydall may have a number of components on a particular automotive platform and applications can range across all types of vehicles from sport utility models to trucks  vans and cars 
thus  there is no direct correlation between the number of lydall products sold and the number of vehicles being built by automotive manufacturers 
slight fluctuations in automotive production have relatively little effect on lydall s business  however  a major downward shift could prevent lydall from achieving its anticipated results 
raw material pricing and supply raw material pricing and supply issues affect all of lydall s businesses and can influence results in the short term 
the thermal acoustical segment uses aluminum to manufacture most automotive heat shields 
volatility in aluminum prices could impact the thermal acoustical segment s profitability where the company is selling its products under long term agreements with fixed sales prices 
new product introductions improved performance and growth is partially linked to new product introductions planned for the future 
the timing and degree of success of new product programs could impact lydall s anticipated results 
lydall does not undertake to update any forward looking statement made in this report or that may from time to time be made by or on behalf of the company 
consolidated results of operations net sales for the year ended december   lydall recorded net sales of million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or percent 
the improvement in net sales was attributable to increases in sales volumes across all core businesses 
these increases were driven by new platform and product awards in the automotive business and new business gains in filtration and bioprocessing coupled with the incremental sales added by the ossipee operation  acquired in october  and the impact of foreign currency translation of approximately percent 
in  the company generated million in net sales compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales was primarily the result of the divestment of two german operations at the end of the third quarter of those operations contributed million in sales for after adjusting net sales for this divestment  as well as the 
table of contents divestments of a gasket business during the first quarter of  a fiberboard operation at the end of the first quarter of and the acquisition of the ossipee operation in the fourth quarter of  net sales for and were million and million  respectively 
as adjusted  net sales for the thermal acoustical segment for improved over primarily due to increased automotive sales 
this increase was offset by a decline in net sales from the filtration separation segment and other products and services due to lower demand for air filtration products and the slow down in the economy  which reduced sales of the company s industrial substrate products 
gross margin lydall recorded gross margin for the year ended december  of percent compared with percent for the year ended december  although the company realized an increase in net sales in from  several items negatively impacted gross margin 
these items included a significant operating loss at the columbus operation described more fully below in the fourth quarter of  an increase in tooling sales which typically have low or no gross margin  sales mix changes in other thermal products and start up costs associated with the newport news distribution center 
in addition  order deferrals for air filtration and bioprocessing products in the fourth quarter led to under absorption of factory overhead 
these negative events combined to more than offset the significant improvement in the operating performance of the vital fluids and industrial thermal businesses and gross margin improvement from increased sales volumes of automotive products 
the company recorded gross margin for the year ended december  of percent compared with percent for the year ended december  the company improved its gross margin despite lower sales volumes primarily due to the sale of the unprofitable german operations at the end of the third quarter of and the achievement of operational efficiencies  particularly within the thermal acoustical segment 
selling  product development and administrative expenses selling  product development and administrative expenses were million  or percent of net sales for  compared with million  or percent for the amount includes million of goodwill amortization  which in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

adjusting the amount for the goodwill amortization  selling  product development and administrative expenses increased 
million  or less than percent in from increases from the addition of the ossipee operation and additional accruals for incentive compensation under the company s economic value added eva program were substantially offset by controlled spending  targeted headcount reductions and minimized usage of external consulting 
selling  product development and administrative expenses were million for compared with million for due to the disposition of several operations and the company s continued focus on controlling these costs 
impairment and restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a final pre tax non cash charge of 
million  or 
per diluted share related to the closed fiberboard operation 
this charge represented the write off of the remaining assets that could not be sold 
during  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million  or 
per diluted share for closing costs  severance benefits and impairment of assets held for sale related to the closing of the fiberboard operation 
on april   the company sold certain assets of this business for approximately million and announced that the operation would be closed

for the year ended december   lydall recorded other expense of million  consisting primarily of interest expense of million 
interest expense for was 
million less than interest expense for  primarily due to lower debt levels and interest rates 
for the year ended december   other expense amounted to million 
the two major components of this amount were a million loss on the disposition of two german operations and an offsetting gain of million on the sale of the gasket business 

table of contents income taxes the effective rate on income from continuing operations for the year ended december  was percent compared to an effective rate of percent in the effective tax rate for was impacted favorably by benefits derived from tax exempt export income  state income tax credits realized during the year  as well as the favorable resolution of tax issues in a tax audit

the effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  was a benefit of percent 
the tax rate reflected a tax benefit on the consolidated loss for the year and additional benefits derived from exempt foreign sales corporation income and state income tax credits 
segment results thermal acoustical net sales for the thermal acoustical segment for were million compared with million for  an increase of million  or percent 
the increase in segment net sales was primarily driven by increased automotive product and tooling sales for new platforms and the full year impact of the ossipee operation  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of the impact of foreign currency translation increased segment net sales by approximately percent for sales to the automotive industry accounted for approximately percent of total segment net sales in strong performance by the company s gerhardi operation in germany as new platforms such as the bmw mini  the bmw series and new business with nissan contributed to the increase in segment net sales for growth in europe is expected to remain strong going forward

the new facility  to be located in st 
nazaire  france  is anticipated to come online in and is expected to provide the additional capacity needed to support the company s european customers 
industrial thermal acoustical products account for approximately percent of total segment net sales and include the sales of the ossipee operation acquired in sales of these products are particularly sensitive to economic conditions  and as a result  posted only modest revenue gains in resulting from new business in building materials and market share gains in the appliance market 
for  operating income was million compared to million in  an increase of million  or percent 
the increase  excluding goodwill amortization of million in no longer amortized under fas  was million 
operating margin for was percent of segment net sales compared to percent in the increase in operating income for was the result of increased automotive sales  the realization of operational improvements at the green island operation and the addition of the ossipee operation 
additionally  the impact of foreign currency translation increased segment operating income by approximately percent for operating margin was negatively impacted by sales mix changes in other thermal products  higher tooling sales that carry low or no margin and the significant operating loss at the columbus operation described more fully below in the fourth quarter of net sales for the thermal acoustical segment for were million compared with million for  a decrease of million  or percent 
operating income increased by million  or percent from the decrease in segment net sales was primarily the result of the divestment of two unprofitable german operations at the end of the third quarter of those operations contributed million in sales for in addition  the divestments of the fiberboard operation and the gasket business negatively impacted segment net sales year over year 
offsetting these declines was the acquisition of the ossipee operation during the fourth quarter of adjusted for acquisitions and dispositions  segment net sales were million for compared with million for  an increase of approximately percent 
sales to the automotive industry accounted for approximately percent of total segment net sales in for the year ended december   lydall increased its continuing automotive business by approximately percent through the success of new products  increased content on key platforms and increased sales to the european market

in addition  during october  this business completed its acquisition of the ossipee operation  complementing its existing passive thermal business 
filtration separation for  filtration separation segment net sales increased million  or percent to million from million in this increase was primarily driven by increased sales of air filtration products in europe  liquid filtration products in the united states  as well as increases in the bioprocessing and blood management businesses 
the impact of foreign currency translation increased segment net sales by approximately percent for sales of filtration products increased approximately percent in from levels 
the increase was driven by new business gains of the company s microglass air filtration products in europe  strong year over year growth of carbon filter media for liquid filtration and the introduction of membrane composite media 
this increase for was achieved in spite of soft commercial and industrial and semiconductor markets 
sales of vital fluids products increased approximately percent for compared to increased market share and market growth for charter medical s flexible containers for bioprocessing applications and a percent increase in blood and cell therapy products contributed to the increase 
in addition  charter medical received regulatory approval for certain of its blood management products in allowing for distribution in europe and canada 
these increases were partially offset by lower demand for cardiotomy reservoir components during the year

foreign currency translation did not have a significant impact on segment operating income 
for  filtration separation segment net sales declined million  or percent to million compared with operating income declined by approximately million  or percent for compared with sales of air filtration products declined approximately percent from to due principally to softness in domestic commercial construction and declines in new cleanspace construction in asia 
this decrease was partially offset by stronger sales of air filtration products in europe and increased revenues of higher growth liquid filtration products 
operating income declined due to lower sales volume 
sales of vital fluids management systems were flat for the year compared with primarily due to bioprocessing order deferrals in the fourth quarter of for the full year  sales of bio pak tm containers nearly doubled year levels 
operating income was negatively impacted primarily due to write offs of blood management products during the second quarter of other products and services segment net sales were million for  a decrease of million  or percent from million in segment net sales declined primarily due to the divestment of the fiberboard operation in the first half of after removing the related sales impact of the fiberboard operation from  segment net sales increased by approximately

critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
note in notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s management is required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ from management s estimates 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method whereby the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition 
goodwill represents the costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
the company has goodwill recorded  net of accumulated amortization  of million and million at december  and  respectively 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas requires that goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but rather are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the specific guidance and criteria described in the standard 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units as defined in fas  including the related goodwill 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows as well as other factors 
future cash flows can be affected by numerous factors including changes in economic  industry or market conditions  changes in the underlying business or products of the reporting unit  changes in competition and changes in technology 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  changes in any of the factors discussed above or any other factors could affect the fair value of one or more of the reporting units resulting in an impairment charge 
such a charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s reported financial condition and results of operations 
although no goodwill impairment has been recorded to date  there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  fas which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the determination of such amounts is made in consultation with the company s outside actuaries based on information and assumptions provided by the company 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plans in the united states 
a significant element in determining the company s pension expense is the expected return on plan assets 
based on our review of market trends  actual returns on plan assets and other factors  the company lowered the expected long term rate of return on plan assets from percent to percent for determining pension expense 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets at the beginning of the year and this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense for that year 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred  within certain parameters  as discussed below 
the company continually assesses its assumed long term rate of return and will adjust such rate as deemed appropriate 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  corporate debt instruments 
at december   the company determined this rate to be percent  a decrease of basis points from the rate used at december  and basis points from that used at december  increases or decreases in the discount rate result in decreases and increases  respectively  in the projected benefit obligation 
the net effect of changes in the discount rate are deferred within certain parameters  as discussed below 
fas requires that gains or losses as defined in fas be deferred unless the unrecognized net gain or loss at the end of a year exceeds a corridor as defined in fas 
if the deferred gain or loss exceeds the corridor at the end of the year  then the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized over a period equal to the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits 
as of december   the net deferred loss exceeded the corridor 
consequently pension expense for is expected to include amortization of a portion of the deferred loss in excess of the corridor 
the amount of amortization in future years will be dependent on changes in the components of the deferred loss amount  particularly actual return on plan assets in relation to the estimated return on plan assets  as well as future increases or decreases in the discount rate 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized pension expense of million and million  respectively 
as discussed above  the company has lowered its expected return on plan assets to percent 
in addition  the reduction in the discount rate to percent and the lower than expected return on plan assets in have increased the deferred loss subject to amortization 
these factors are expected to negatively impact pension expense in see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  fas which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  related to future tax benefits arising from deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards are million and million at december  and  respectively 
management believes that the company s earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related net future income tax benefits 
for those jurisdictions where the projected operating results indicate that the ability to realize the future benefits is uncertain or not likely  a valuation allowance has been provided 

table of contents in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period that such determination was made 
conversely  if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance and record an increase to income in the period that such determination was made
