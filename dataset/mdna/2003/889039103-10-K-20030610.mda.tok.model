item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s environmental and bodily injury matters 
safety matters the company is also subject to the federal occupational safety and health act osha and similar state statutes 
the company has an extensive health and safety program and employs a staff of safety inspectors whose primary functions are to develop company policies that meet or exceed the safety standards set by osha  train production supervisors and make periodic inspections of safety procedures to insure compliance with company policies on safety and industrial hygiene 
all shipyard employees are required to attend regularly scheduled safety training meetings 
backlog at march  the company s backlog consists of approximately million of repair  maintenance  and conversion work 
this compares with backlogs of approximately million and million at march  and april   respectively 
the company s current backlog is primarily attributable to firm repair  maintenance and conversion work scheduled for completion during fiscal year in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  several planned navy repair projects were delayed due to the conflicts in iraq 
these delays contributed to the decline in firm backlog orders at march   when compared to the prior fiscal years 
these delayed repair projects are anticipated to start in the second quarter of fiscal year since work under the company s three navy phased maintenance contracts is at the option of the navy  the company cannot provide assurance as to the timing or level of work that may be performed under these contracts 
therefore  projected revenues from these contracts are not included in the company s backlog until contract options are exercised by the navy 
investments and acquisitions the company may evaluate suitable investment opportunities that it believes will appropriately utilize the company s resources 
however  the company has no present plans to make any direct investments in other businesses  either related or unrelated to ship repair and overhaul activities 
item properties the company is required to maintain navy certification on its drydocks and cranes in order to be eligible to bid on and perform work under certain navy and united states coast guard coast guard contracts 
throughout fiscal year  the company maintained all required certifications 
the design capacities of the company s three drydocks  all of which are located at the shipyard  are as follows year type max 
design date of lease name built owned leased capacity in tons expiration emerald sea steel  yfd steel  yfd wood  the company evaluates its plans for future operations for each of its leased dry docks when the lease expiration date falls within the next operating cycle 
accordingly  the company will begin evaluating its plans for renewal of the yfd lease during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year the lease terms on drydock yfd contain a nominal annual lease payment and a minimum amount of annual maintenance that the company must perform 
the lease also includes minimum levels of maintenance that the company must perform during the life of the lease 
the lease terms on drydock yfd include both an annual lease payment and a minimum amount of annual maintenance to be performed by the company 
the company has included the nominal annual lease payment and the average annual maintenance cost that must be performed over the life of the lease on drydock yfd  as well as the annual lease payments that must be made on drydock yfd in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements item 
the company s current navy drydock certifications are less than the drydocks maximum design capacity  however they are sufficient to allow the company to perform work on all non nuclear navy vessels homeported in puget sound  as well as all coast guard and washington state ferry vessels 
the company believes that owned and leased properties at the shipyard are in reasonable operating condition given their age and usage  although  from time to time  the company has been required to incur substantial expenditures to ensure the continuing serviceability of certain owned and leased machinery and equipment 
towards the end of fiscal year  the company determined that such serviceability repairs would be required on the emerald sea to maintain navy certification on a long term basis 
certain time sensitive repairs began early in fiscal year  while the company evaluated several alternative repair scenarios and management s plans for future operations 
once the company completed its evaluation in fiscal year  a comprehensive  multi year refurbishment plan was approved by management that will allow the company to maintain navy certification into the future 
this multi year plan includes scheduled refurbishment periods so repairs do not interfere with the on going shipyard operations 
the company anticipates that capitalized costs associated with this plan will be approximately million in fiscal year the company will continue to assess this refurbishment plan as it progresses and make appropriate changes as needed to support shipyard operations 
subsequent to fiscal year  the company announced a special capital budget plan of approximately million for improvements to its seattle shipyard facility during its fiscal years and these improvements include the replacement of a major pier  a stormwater collection and discharge system and significant upgrades to its electrical system and will be in addition to the company s routine annual capital expenditures 
item legal proceedings the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the treatment  storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes 
fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with these laws 
such laws and regulations may expose the company to liability for acts of the company  which are or were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed 
the company faces potential liabilities in connection with the alleged presence of hazardous waste materials at its seattle shipyard and at several sites used by the company for disposal of alleged hazardous waste 
the company is identified as a prp by the environmental protection agency epa under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  commonly known as the superfund in connection with matters pending at two superfund sites 
in fiscal year  the company satisfied its liability at one superfund site

the company has also been named as a defendant in a number of civil actions alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at closed former company facilities 
at march   the company maintained aggregate reserves of million for pending claims and assessments relating to environmental matters  including million associated with the harbor island superfund site the harbor island site and million for asbestos related claims 
funding for costs and payments of claims represented by such reserves is expected to be provided to a significant extent by receivables due from insurance companies under policies and insurance in place agreements described below 
at march   such receivables aggregated million 
reference is made to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements item below and to the discussion under the heading environmental matters and contingencies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item below 
harbor island site the company and several other parties have been named as prps by the epa pursuant to cercla in connection with the documented release or threatened release of hazardous substances  pollutants and contaminants at the harbor island superfund site  the harbor island site 
harbor island site insurance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company entered into a year agreement with an insurance company that will provide the company with broad based insurance coverage for the remediation of all of the company s operable units at the harbor island superfund site 
the agreement provides coverage for the known liabilities in an amount exceeding the company s current booked reserves of million 
additionally  the company has entered into a year agreement for coverage of any new environmental conditions discovered at the seattle shipyard property that would require environmental remediation 
the company funded this insurance premium from cash reserves in two installments 
the first payment was made in the company s fourth quarter of fiscal year and the second payment was made in the first quarter of fiscal year the company recorded a non current asset in the form of an insurance receivable in accordance with its environmental accounting policies at the time it entered into this agreement 
this transaction did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  nor did the transaction have a material effect on stockholders equity 
harbor island site history to date  the epa has separated the harbor island site into three operable units that affect the company the soil and groundwater unit the soil unit  the shipyard sediments operable unit the ssou and the sediments operable unit the sou 
the company  along with a number of other harbor island prps  received a special notice letter from the epa on may  pursuant to section e of cercla 
the company entered into a consent decree for the soil unit in september under which the company has agreed to remediate the designated contamination on its property 
removal of floating petroleum product from the water table began in october and is anticipated to continue through fiscal year the company and the epa are currently negotiating the extent and methodology of the soil remediation 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  the epa issued its record of decision rod for the ssou 
the rod identifies four alternative solutions for the ssou remediation and identifies the epa s selected remedy 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  the epa expanded the boundaries of the ssou issuing their phase b data report and resulting explanation of significant differences outlining the changes to the rod 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company and the epa entered into an administrative order on consent for the development of the remedial design for the ssou 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company and the epa entered into a consent decree for the cleanup of the ssou  which  along with the associated remedial design statement of work for remedial action sow  was subsequently approved by the department of justice 
the consent decree provides for the submittal of the remedial action work plan to the epa subsequent to the approval by the epa of the final design 
the remedial action work plan will provide for construction and implementation of the remedy set forth in the rod  the two explanation of significant differences issued in fiscal years and  the sow  and the design plans and specifications developed in accordance with the remedial action work plan and approved by the epa 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the company submitted its sow to the epa for the ssou 
the sow provides for the following actions to take place at the ssou piers and south located on the duwamish waterway will be demolished and removed from the site to achieve more complete cleanup in those areas 
pier south will be rebuilt after remediation with a shortened berth length 
dredging of all contaminated sediments and shipyard waste in the open areas of the ssou surrounding the shipyard and in the areas beneath piers and south 
the total estimated volume of sediments to be removed is  cubic yards 
disposal of all recovered sediment and shipyard waste at an appropriate upland disposal facility 
backfilling of portions of the areas dredged to create inter tidal habitat where feasible 
capping of areas beneath the piers that are not scheduled for demolition to an average thickness of one foot 
pursuant to the current schedule  remediation of the ssou is expected to begin in the second quarter of fiscal current environmental regulations limit the period of time during the year that dredging may occur 
given these limits  dredging in the ssou will require several years to complete 
the current estimated cost of the ssou cleanup is included in the environmental reserve resulting in an increase in that reserve of million during fiscal year million of that reserve is covered by the environmental insurance policy procured by the company in fiscal year and has been recorded as an insurance receivable 
the net difference of million represents a portion of the million environmental remediation expense recorded by the company during the quarter ending march  during january  the company was notified by the epa that testing would be required in the west waterway of the duwamish river outside the borders of the ssou as part of the sou 
during may  the company entered into an administrative order on consent to perform certain limited testing as part of the sou investigation 
after an evaluation of the results  the epa issued a draft no action rod on the sou for public comment which if issued in final form would end the investigation of the sou  requiring no remedial action 
the public comment period closed during the company s fourth quarter of fiscal year and the epa has not yet announced the results 
under the federal superfund law  potentially responsible parties may have liability for damages to natural resources in addition to liability for remediation 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company began discussions with the natural resource trustees trustees for the harbor island superfund site site and continued these discussions during the remainder of fiscal year the company anticipates that the trustees will file a claim against the company at some future date alleging damages to the natural resources at the site caused by the release of hazardous substances 
the best estimate of a potential natural resource damage claim has been included in the environmental reserve 
the payment of any eventual claim is covered by the aforementioned insurance policy  except for the policy deductible  provided that aggregate policy limits have not been exceeded 
the amount of the policy deductible payment is reflected in the company s environmental reserve at march   and million is included in environmental remediation expense in the quarter ending march  asbestos related claims and insurance the company has been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at closed former company facilities 
the cases generally include as defendants  in addition to the company  other ship builders and repairers  ship owners  asbestos manufacturers  distributors and installers  and equipment manufacturers and arise from injuries or illnesses allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos or other toxic substances 
the company assesses claims as they are filed and as the cases develop  dividing them into two different categories based on severity of illness 
based on current fact patterns  certain diseases including mesothelioma  lung cancer and fully developed asbestosis are categorized by the company as malignant claims 
all other claims of a less medically serious nature are categorized as non malignant 
the company is currently defending approximately malignant claims and approximately non malignant claims 
the relief sought in all cases varies greatly by jurisdiction and claimant 
included in the approximate cases open as of march  are approximately claimants 
the exact number of claimants is not determinable as approximately of the open cases include multiple claimant filings against defendants 
the filings do not indicate which claimants allege liability against the company 
the previously stated claimants is the company s best estimate taking known facts into consideration 
approximately claimants do not assert any specific amount of relief sought 
approximately claims contain standard boilerplate language asserting on behalf of each claimant a claim for damages of million compensatory and million punitive against approximately defendants 
approximately claims set forth the same boilerplate language asserting million in compensatory and million in punitive damages on behalf of each claimant against approximately defendants 
approximately cases assert million in compensatory and million in punitive damages on behalf of each claimant against approximately defendants 
approximately claimants seek compensatory damages of less than  per claim and approximately claimants seek compensatory damages between million and million 
the claims involved in the foregoing cases do not specify against which defendants which claims are made or alleged dates of exposure 
based upon settled or concluded claims to date  the company has not identified any correlation between the amount of the relief sought in the complaint and the final value of the claim 
the company and its insurers are vigorously defending these actions 
during fiscal year  the company experienced no material changes in its bodily injury liabilities and insurance receivables 
at both march  and march   respectively  the company had recorded bodily injury liability reserves of million and bodily injury insurance receivables of million 
these bodily injury liabilities and receivables are classified within the company s consolidated balance sheets as environmental and other reserves  and insurance receivables  respectively 
the company has entered into agreements with several of its insurers to provide coverage for a significant portion of settlements and awards related to these bodily injury claims 
these agreements have aggregate limits on amounts to be paid overall and formulas for amounts of payment on individual claims 
the two most significant agreements provide coverage applicable to claims of exposure to asbestos occurring between and and occurring between through insurance coverage for exposures to asbestos was no longer available from the insurance industry after due to changes in federal regulations in the s that resulted in the swift decline in commercial and military application of asbestos and increased regulation over the handling and removal of asbestos  there exists minimal risk of claims arising from exposure after contractual formulas are utilized to determine the amount of coverage from each agreement on each claim settled or litigated 
once the initial date of alleged exposure to asbestos is determined  all contractual years subsequent to that date participate in the settlement 
since all known claims involve alleged exposure prior to  the through agreement will participate in the settlement or judgement of all outstanding claims that are settled or litigated 
as a result  and as the years remaining calculation set forth below indicates  the through agreement will exhaust prior to the through agreement 
based on historical claims settlement data only  the company projects that at march   the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years and the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years 
at march   the company projected that these agreements would provide coverage for an additional years and years  respectively 
the company resolved malignant claims in compared with in and in if historical settlement patterns or the rate of filing for new cases change in future periods  these estimated coverage periods could be shorter or longer than anticipated 
moreover  if one or both of these coverages are exhausted at some future date  the company s costs related to subsequent claims and for legal expenses previously covered by these insurance agreements may increase 
in addition to providing coverage for assessments or settlements of claims  the agreements also provide for costs of defending and processing such claims 
the following chart indicates the number of claims filed and resolved in the past three fiscal years  including the number of claims yet to be resolved at the end of each fiscal year 
resolution includes settlements  adjudications and dismissals 
the claims are further categorized as either malignant or non malignant 
bodily injury claims non malignant malignant total outstanding  april  claims filed claims resolved outstanding  april  claims filed claims resolved outstanding  march  claims filed claims resolved outstanding  march  due to uncertainties of the number of cases  the extent of alleged damages  the population of claimants and size of any awards and or settlements  there can be no assurance that the current reserves will be adequate to cover the costs of resolving the existing cases 
additionally  the company cannot predict the eventual number of cases to be filed against it or their eventual resolution and does not include in its reserve amounts for cases that may be filed in the future 
however  it is probable that if future cases are filed against the company it will result in additional costs arising either from its share of costs under current insurance in place arrangements or due to the exhaustion of such coverage 
the company reviews the adequacy of existing reserves periodically based upon developments affecting these claims  including new filings and resolutions  and makes adjustments to the reserve and related insurance receivable as appropriate 
as the company is not able to estimate its potential ultimate exposure for filed and unfiled claims against the company  it cannot predict whether the ultimate resolution of the bodily injury cases will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or stockholders equity

the exact price was determined by a procedure commonly referred to as a dutch auction 
the company elected to increase the number of shares to be purchased in order to avoid proration procedures otherwise applicable to the offer and purchased an aggregate of  shares at a price of per share 
the tender offer was completed in the second quarter of fiscal year see item management s discussion analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

this settlement transferred a portion of the company s pension liability to an international labor union organization 
under the provisions of pension accounting  the settlement of these liabilities triggered recognition of certain cumulative differences between pension plan assumptions and actual results 
in fiscal year  the company repurchased an aggregate of  shares of its common stock at a price of per share through its tender offer dutch auction that was completed as of july  the company s working capital  total assets  and stockholders equity declined approximately million as a result of the share repurchases and related transactions

item management s discussion analysis of financial condition and results of operations the notes to the consolidated financial statements are an integral part of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction herewith 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results in future periods may differ significantly from the results discussed in or anticipated by such forward looking statements 
certain factors  which may impact results for future periods  are discussed below under the captions overview profitability  and environmental matters 
readers should also consider the statements and factors discussed under the caption operations overview in item and the discussion of environmental matters and related bodily injury claims set forth in item of this annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission for the fiscal year ended march   together with the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year then ended 
overview fiscal year started very strongly as the company had significant revenue increases during the first six months of the year 
these increases were primarily attributable to the large concentration of repair  maintenance and overhaul work awarded under each of the company s three us navy phased maintenance contracts 
during the first half of fiscal year  the company recorded million  or of its full year revenue 
the company s financial results during this period were very favorable as the company recorded operating income and income before income tax expense of million and million  respectively 
however  the financial results for the third and fourth quarters of this year were very disappointing as revenues for the second half of the year fell to million  a decrease of from the volumes experienced during the first and second quarters 
while the company had anticipated the reduced business volume and decline in revenues  it had not anticipated the significant decline in profitability during the second half of the fiscal year 
during this six month period  the company sustained an operating loss and a loss before income tax expense of million and million  respectively 
operating losses during the second half of fiscal year  were the result of four primary factors 
first  the company experienced higher direct costs on two fixed priced projects that commenced and were completed in the third quarter 
the impact of these cost increases  which had no corresponding revenue associated with them  reduced operating income by approximately million 
second  the company underestimated the total costs to complete a fixed price project that commenced in the third quarter but was not completed until april the estimating problem was not determined until the fourth quarter 
the impact of this estimating error reduced operating income by approximately million in the quarter ending march  third  the company recognized in the third quarter a non recurring  non cash charge of million arising from the settlement of a portion of the company s pension liabilities 
this settlement transferred a portion of the company s pension liability to an international labor union organization 
under the provisions of pension accounting  the settlement of these liabilities triggered recognition of certain cumulative differences between pension plan assumptions and actual results 
fourth  the company recognized million in environmental remediation expenses during the fourth quarter 
for the full year ended march   the company recorded revenue of million  which represents an increase of million  or approximately  over fiscal year reported revenue of million 
this revenue increase  as mentioned previously  is primarily attributable to the large concentration of repair  maintenance and overhaul work under the company s three us navy phased maintenance contracts that occurred during the first and second quarters of this year 
during fiscal year  the company recorded operating income of million on revenue of million  or approximately of revenue 
this represents a decrease in operating income of million  or approximately from fiscal year operating income of million 
the decline in operating income reported  as previously mentioned  was primarily attributable to higher direct costs on two fixed priced projects  an error in estimating the costs to complete a third fixed priced project  a non cash charge arising from the settlement of a portion of the company s pension liabilities  and an environmental remediation charge 
in addition  the company recognized million in non operating investment income for the year ended march  the investment income in addition to the operating income reported  resulted in fiscal year income before income tax expense of million 
auxiliary oiler explosive aoe contract during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company was awarded a six year  sole source cost type contract for phased maintenance repairs to four department of navy aoe class supply ships 
this contract represents the fourth consecutive  multi year contract that the company has been awarded by the navy on the aoe class vessels 
the notional value of this new contract is expected to be approximately million if all options are exercised 
work on this contract is being performed primarily in the company s seattle shipyard 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the navy announced its intention to decommission aoe and aoe for transfer to the military sealift command msc in calendar years and  respectively 
the transfer of these vessels to msc will reduce the company s future work under its current cost type contract with the navy 
the company anticipates that msc will contract for future work on these vessels on a competitive  fixed price basis 
the potential impact of this transfer on the company s future aoe revenues cannot be determined at this time  but will depend on factors such as the realized reduction in aoe revenues upon transfer to msc  the company s ability to bid on future aoe and aoe work once transferred  and the company s bidding success if such bids are submitted 
combatant maintenance team cmt contract during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company was awarded  by the department of the navy on a sole source basis  a five year  cost type contract for the repair and maintenance of six surface combatant class vessels frigates and destroyers stationed in the puget sound area 
although the navy has not released a notional value of the maintenance work  the company believes that the value may be approximately million to million if all options are exercised 
work on this contract is being performed primarily in the company s seattle shipyard 
planned incremental availability pia during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the department of the navy awarded the company a five year cost type contract for phased maintenance on three cvn class aircraft carriers 
the notional value for this five year contract is approximately million if all options are exercised 
work on this contract is currently being performed at the puget sound naval shipyard  located in bremerton  washington 
preservation contract the mv yakima during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company was awarded a million overhaul contract to renovate the washington state ferry  mv yakima 
work on this project commenced during the third quarter of fiscal year and called for the replacement or renovation of the majority of the vessel s interior structures  including the replacement of steel plating  passenger area furniture  galley  fixtures  windows  and the removal of hazardous materials 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company successfully completed and delivered the vessel to the washington state ferry system ahead of the contractually scheduled delivery date 
the company earned financial incentives for the early delivery of the vessel and these incentives were recognized in fiscal year contract revenue 
power barge contract the margarita ii in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company commenced work on a floating electrical power plant  the margarita ii 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the margarita ii was delivered to its owner 
to maintain production schedule deadlines and perform customer directed change orders the company experienced significant contract cost growth in both labor hours and material 
however  at the time of vessel delivery  an agreement had not reached between the company and the owner regarding the potential increase in the contract price to compensate for all of these changes 
in accordance with the terms of the contract  the company and the vessel owner agreed to settle the remaining change orders through a formal arbitration process 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  the company was awarded approximately million  as well as interest and certain agreed expenses  by the arbitration board 
the company recognized the award in fiscal year critical accounting policies the company s established accounting policies are outlined in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this form k entitled principal accounting policies 
as part of its reporting responsibilities  management continually evaluates and reviews the adequacy of its accounting policies and methods as new events occur 
management believes that its policies are applied in a consistent manner that provides the user of the company s financial statements with a current  accurate and complete presentation of information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how these judgments and estimates can impact the company s financial statements 
a critical accounting policy is one that management believes may contain difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to the company s results of operation 
the company has identified its most critical accounting policies which relate to revenue recognition  environmental remediation  bodily injury  other reserves  and insurance receivable and deferred pension asset and accrued post retirement health benefits 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue  contract costs  and profit on the percentage of completion method based upon direct labor hours incurred 
using the percentage of completion method requires the company to make certain estimates of the total cost to complete a project  estimates of project schedule and completion dates  estimates of the percentage at which the project is complete  estimates of annual overhead rates and estimates of amounts of any probable unapproved claims and or change orders 
these estimates are continuously evaluated and updated by experienced project management and accounting personnel assigned to these activities  and senior management also reviews them on a periodic basis 
when adjustments in contract value or estimated costs are determined  any changes from prior estimates are generally reflected in revenue in the current period 
the company has considerable experience in managing multiple projects simultaneously and in preparing accurate cost estimates  schedules and project completion dates 
however  many factors  including but not limited to weather  fluctuations in material prices  labor shortages  and timely availability of materials can affect the accuracy of these estimates and may impact future revenues either favorably or unfavorably 
us government procurement standards are followed to determine the allowability as well as the allocability of costs charged to government contracts 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are closely scrutinized for compliance with underlying regulatory standards by shipyards personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 
other than normal cost accounting issues raised by the dcaa as a result of their regular  ongoing reviews  the company is not aware of any outstanding issues with the dcaa 
environmental remediation  bodily injury  other reserves and insurance receivable the company faces potential liabilities in connection with the alleged presence of hazardous waste materials at its seattle shipyard and at several sites used by the company for disposal of alleged hazardous waste 
the company has also been named as a defendant in a number of civil actions alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at former company facilities that are now closed 
at march   the company maintained aggregate reserves of million for pending claims and assessments relating to these environmental matters  including million associated with the company s seattle shipyard site and million for asbestos or bodily injury related claims 
the company has various insurance policies and agreements that provide coverage on the costs to remediate these environmental sites and for the defense and settlement of bodily injury claims 
at march   the company had recorded an insurance receivable of million relating to these environmental and bodily injury matters  including million associated with the company s seattle shipyard site and million for bodily injury related claims 
the company reviews these matters on a continual basis and revises its estimates of known liabilities and insurance recoveries when appropriate 
the company follows guidance provided in statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities for recording its environmental liabilities and recoveries 
the company accounts for bodily injury liabilities in accordance with financial accounting standards board no 
 accounting for contingencies 
estimating environmental remediation liabilities requires judgments and assessments based upon independent professional knowledge  the experience of company management and legal counsel 
environmental liabilities are based on judgments that include calculating the cost of alternative remediation methods and disposal sites  changes in the boundaries of the remediation areas  and the impact of regulatory changes 
bodily injury liabilities are based on judgments that include the number of outstanding claims  the expected outcome of claim litigation and anticipated settlement amounts for open claims based on historical experience 
the company does not accrue liabilities for unknown bodily injury claims that may be asserted in the future due to uncertainties of the number of cases that may be filed and the extent of damages that may be alleged 
the development of liability estimates that support both environmental remediation and bodily injury reserves involve complex matters that include the development of estimates and the use of judgments 
the actual outcome of these matters may differ from company estimates 
to the extent not covered by insurance  increases to environmental remediation and bodily injury liabilities would unfavorably impact future earnings 
the company s insurance recoveries for environmental remediation and bodily injury claims are estimated independently from the associated liabilities and are based on insurance coverages or contractual agreements negotiated with its former insurance companies 
these policies and agreements are primarily with two insurance companies 
based upon the current credit rating of both of these companies  the company anticipates that both insurance companies will be able to satisfy their respective obligations under the policy or agreement 
however  if this assumption is incorrect and either of these companies is unable to meet its future financial commitments  the company s financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 
pension asset and accrued post retirement health benefits the company s employee pension and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations are governed by financial accounting standards no 
and no 
under these rules  management determines appropriate assumptions about the future  which are used by actuaries to estimate net costs and liabilities 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trends  inflation rates  long term rates of return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
management bases these assumptions on historical results  the current environment and reasonable expectations of future events 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect pension and other post retirement benefits costs and obligations 
see note to the financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee pension and other post retirement benefits 
business volume and backlog at march  the company s backlog consists of approximately million of repair  maintenance  and conversion work 
this compares with backlogs of approximately million and million at march  and april   respectively 
the company s current backlog is primarily attributable to firm repair  maintenance and conversion work scheduled for completion during fiscal year in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  several planned navy repair projects were delayed due to the conflicts in iraq 
these delays contributed to the decline in firm backlog orders at march   when compared to the prior fiscal years 
these delayed repair projects are anticipated to start in the second quarter of fiscal year since work under the company s three navy phased maintenance contracts is at the option of the navy  the company cannot provide assurance as to the timing or level of work that may be performed under these contracts 
therefore  projected revenues from these contracts are not included in the company s backlog until contract options are exercised by the navy 
profitability the company s future profitability depends largely on the ability of the shipyard to maintain an adequate volume of ship repair  overhaul and conversion business to augment its longer term contracts 
the variables affecting the company s business volume include public support provided to competing northwest shipyards  excess west coast and industry wide shipyard capacity  foreign competition  governmental legislation and regulatory issues  activity levels of the us navy  competitors pricing behavior  and company labor efficiencies  work practices and estimating abilities 
other factors that can contribute to future profitability include the amounts of annual expenditures needed to ensure continuing serviceability of the company s owned and leased machinery and equipment 
the company continues to respond aggressively to the increasingly competitive shipbuilding and repair industry 
in addition to management s focus on the profitability of existing shipyard operations through reduced operating costs  improved production efficiencies  customer needs and the pursuit of new business volume  management continues to evaluate options for deployment of assets with a view to improving the company s return on investment 
year to year comparisons compared with net income for fiscal year decreased by million  or from fiscal year levels 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in income before taxes of million offset by a decrease in income taxes payable of million 
net income for fiscal year was influenced as a result of the following components revenues the company recorded revenue of million during fiscal year  which represents an increase of million  or approximately  over fiscal year reported revenue of million 
us navy phased maintenance contracts accounted for approximately million of this increase  while increases in other commercial and government repair and overhaul activities  and new construction activities accounted for million and million  respectively 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal year increased by million  or approximately from fiscal year the majority of this increase was attributable to increases in work volumes experienced in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year is primarily attributable to higher direct costs on two fixed priced projects that commenced and were completed in the third quarter  as well as underestimating the direct costs to complete a third project that commenced later in the third quarter but was not completed until april the impact of these cost increases  which had no corresponding revenue  increased cost of revenues by approximately million 
also contributing  but to a lesser extent  was a non recurring  non cash charge of million arising from the settlement of a portion of the company s pension liabilities 
this settlement transferred a portion of the company s pension liability to an international labor union organization 
under the provisions of pension accounting  the settlement of these liabilities triggered recognition of certain cumulative differences between pension plan assumptions and actual results 
administrative and manufacturing overhead administrative and manufacturing overhead increased million  or approximately from fiscal year this increase was attributable to an overall increase in production volumes as well as planned maintenance expenses and company initiated process improvement costs 
administrative and manufacturing overhead as a percentage of revenue was approximately in fiscal year  which was consistent with the rate experienced in the prior fiscal year 
provision for environmental reserves and other during fiscal year  the company estimated that the expected remediation costs associated with the company s operable units at the harbor island superfund site would increase by approximately million 
this increase in environmental reserves was offset by a million increase in the company s insurance receivable 
the net amount of million is reflected in the company s operating results for fiscal year and is shown in the consolidated statements of income under provision for environmental and other reserves 
also  in fiscal year the company received partial reimbursement from another harbor island potentially responsible party for certain past environmental costs incurred by the company 
this partial reimbursement in the amount of million is reflected in other insurance settlements in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended march  in fiscal year  the company estimated that the remediation costs associated with its harbor island site would increase approximately million 
this amount was fully offset by a similar increase in the company s insurance receivable 
the company also received million in reimbursements from another potentially responsible party during fiscal year investment and other income investment and other income in fiscal year decreased by million or approximately when compared to fiscal year the decrease in investment and other income reported during fiscal year primarily reflects the reduction in the average funds available for investment purposes during the fiscal year  as well as lower investment yields generally available in the market 
in fiscal year  the company s average funds available for investment purposes were million 
in fiscal year  the average funds available for investment purposes declined million  or  to million 
this decline reflects the results of the company s dutch auction share repurchase of million shares of its common stock that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year this repurchase only affected a portion of the average funds available for investment purposes in fiscal year  but affected the average funds available for the entire fiscal year gain on sale of available for sale securities during fiscal year  the company reported a net loss of thousand on the sale of available for sale securities  which is a decrease of million  or approximately from fiscal year the significant decrease in gains on the sale of available for sale securities reported in fiscal year is primarily attributable to market conditions that were more favorable during fiscal year 
income taxes in fiscal year  the company recognized federal income tax expense of million 
this represents a decrease of million  or approximately in federal tax expense when compared to fiscal year this decrease is attributable to the decrease in income before taxes in fiscal year the effective income tax rates recorded in fiscal years and remained relatively unchanged at and  respectively 
the statutory income tax rates for fiscal years and were and  respectively 
differences between effective rates and statutory rates reflect certain non deductible expenses in both years 
compared with net income for fiscal year decreased by million  or approximately from fiscal year levels 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of the following four significant events in fiscal year  the company reached a settlement with the us navy to share in certain environmental insurance costs  which resulted in the company recognizing million in revenue 
the amount the company was able to recognize in fiscal year under the terms of this agreement decreased to million 
in fiscal year  the company received an arbitration award on the margarita ii  which contributed approximately million in revenue  interest income and reimbursed expenses 
in fiscal year  the company recognized million in federal income tax expense while in fiscal year it recorded a federal income tax benefit of million resulting from the elimination of its deferred tax asset valuation reserve 
this change resulted in a million increase in federal income tax expense in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year in fiscal year  the company s pension income decreased million when compared to fiscal year see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more details 
net income for fiscal year was also influenced as a result of the following components revenues the company recorded revenue of million during fiscal year  which represented an increase of million  or approximately over fiscal year revenue 
all revenue recorded by the company in fiscal year was attributable to repair and overhaul activities compared to million in repair and overhaul revenue recorded in fiscal year this increase in repair and overhaul activities of million was offset by a decrease in new construction revenue in fiscal year of million 
increases in repair and overhaul activities were primarily due to the scheduling by ship owners of commercial and government overhaul activities 
new construction revenue recorded in fiscal year was attributable to the margarita ii arbitration settlement 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal year increased by million  or approximately from fiscal year cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year was primarily attributable to the million in revenue the company recognized on the agreement with the us navy to share in certain environmental insurance costs and the million recognized on the margarita ii arbitration award in fiscal year costs associated with these revenues were either incurred in prior years or are not categorized as cost of revenues  which effectively lowered the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year if these amounts were excluded from revenue the resulting cost of revenues as a percentage of revised revenue would have been in fiscal year administrative and manufacturing overhead administrative and manufacturing overhead increased million  or approximately from fiscal year this increase was attributable to increased production volumes during the fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenue  administrative and manufacturing overhead was approximately of revenue in fiscal year administrative and manufacturing overhead as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal year  but would have been if revenues were adjusted to exclude the favorable  non recurring impacts to revenue that occurred that year 
provision for environmental reserves and other during fiscal year  the company estimated that the expected remediation costs associated with the company s operable units at the harbor island superfund site increased by approximately million 
this increase in environmental reserves was offset by a similar increase in the company s insurance receivable 
the recognition of these increases did not impact the company s financial results or stockholders equity 
also  in fiscal year  the company received a partial reimbursement from another harbor island potentially responsible party for certain past environmental costs incurred by the company 
this partial reimbursement in the amount of million is reflected in other insurance settlements in the financial results reported at march  during fiscal year  the company provided million in additional environmental and other reserves 
the reserve increase was more than fully offset by a net insurance settlement of million realized by the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal year investment and other income investment and other income in fiscal year decreased by million when compared to fiscal year this decrease reflected the reduction in available funds for investment purposes as a result of the company s repurchase of million shares in july through its dutch auction tender offer 
the share repurchase decreased available funds for investment purposes by approximately million 
gain on sale of available for sale securities gain on sale of available for sale securities increased million when compared to fiscal year this increase reflected favorable market conditions associated with certain securities  which were sold by the company 
income taxes in fiscal year  the company recognized federal income tax expense of million  an effective income tax rate of 
this represented an increase of million in federal tax expense when compared to fiscal year the company s statutory rate in fiscal year was 
the difference between the company s effective rate and statutory rate is due to certain non deductible costs 
in fiscal year  the company recognized a federal income tax benefit of million after applying all remaining net operating loss carryforwards and business tax credits and the elimination of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
environmental matters and other contingencies the company has provided total aggregate reserves of million as of march  for its contingent environmental and bodily injury liabilities 
due to the complexities and extensive history of the company s environmental and bodily injury matters  the amounts and timing of future expenditures is uncertain 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these environmental and bodily injury matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
the company has various insurance policies and agreements that provide coverage of the costs to remediate environmental sites and for the defense and settlement of bodily injury cases 
these policies and agreements are primarily with two insurance companies 
based upon the current credit rating of both of these companies  the company anticipates that both parties will be able to perform under their respective policy or agreement 
as of march   the company has recorded an insurance receivable of million to reflect the contractual arrangements with several insurance companies to share costs for certain environmental and other matters 
the company continues to negotiate with its insurance carriers and certain prior landowners and operators for past and future remediation costs 
the company has not recorded any receivables for any amounts that may be recoverable from such negotiations or other claims 
ongoing operations recurring costs associated with the company s environmental compliance program are not material and are expensed as incurred 
capital expenditures in connection with environmental compliance are not material to the company s financial statements 
past activities environmental the company faces significant potential liabilities in connection with the alleged presence of hazardous waste materials at its seattle shipyard the harbor island site and at several sites used by the company for disposal of alleged hazardous waste 
the company has also been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances at company facilities 
information with respect to these contingencies and claims is provided in item in this report 
the company s policy is to accrue costs for environmental matters in the accounting period in which the responsibility is established and the cost is estimable 
the company s estimates of its liabilities for environmental matters are based on evaluations of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and take into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations  and the results of negotiations with regulatory authorities 
the company does not discount these liabilities 
in fiscal year  the company spent million for environmental site remediation 
all of these costs are reimbursable to the company through its insurance coverages 
an additional million in environmental site remediation was spent by third party vendors under the direction of the company s management 
these costs were paid directly to the third party vendors under the company s insurance policies 
most of these expenditures were related to the harbor island site 
the company spent approximately million on environmental site remediation in fiscal years and  respectively 
of these amounts  approximately million and million  respectively  were reimbursable to the company under the company s insurance policies 
in addition to environmental site remediation costs  the company spent a net thousand on bodily injury cases after reimbursement under the company s insurance policies in fiscal year in fiscal year and  the company spent million and million  respectively for bodily injury cases after reimbursement under the company s insurance policies 
actual costs to address the harbor island site and other environmental sites and matters will depend upon numerous factors  including the number of parties found liable at each environmental site  the method of remediation  outcome of negotiations with regulatory authorities  outcome of litigation  technological developments and changes in environmental laws and regulations 
the company entered into a consent decree with the epa during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result the company has increased its harbor island site reserves by an additional million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company entered into a year agreement with an insurance company that will provide the company with broad based insurance coverage for the remediation of the company s operable units at the harbor island superfund site 
the agreement provides coverage for the known liabilities in an amount exceeding the company s current booked reserves of million 
additionally  the company has entered into a year agreement for coverage of any new environmental conditions discovered at the seattle shipyard property that would require environmental remediation 
the company funded this insurance premium from cash reserves in two installments 
the first payment was made in the company s fourth quarter of fiscal year and the second payment was made in the first quarter of fiscal year the company recorded a non current asset in the form of an insurance receivable in accordance with its environmental accounting policies at the time it entered into this agreement 
this transaction did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  nor did the transaction have a material effect on stockholders equity 
past activities asbestos and related claims the company has been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at closed former company facilities 
the cases generally include as defendants  in addition to the company  other ship builders and repairers  ship owners  asbestos manufacturers  distributors and installers  and equipment manufacturers and arise from injuries or illnesses allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos or other toxic substances 
the company assesses claims as they are filed and as the cases develop  dividing them into two different categories based on severity of illness 
based on current fact patterns  certain diseases including mesothelioma  lung cancer and fully developed asbestosis are categorized by the company as malignant claims 
all other claims of a less medically serious nature are categorized as non malignant 
the company is currently defending approximately malignant claims and approximately non malignant claims 
the relief sought in all cases varies greatly by jurisdiction and claimant 
included in the approximate cases open as of march  are approximately claimants 
the exact number of claimants is not determinable as approximately of the open cases include multiple claimant filings against defendants 
the filings do not indicate which claimants allege liability against the company 
the previously stated claimants is the company s best estimate taking known facts into consideration 
approximately claimants do not assert any specific amount of relief sought 
approximately claims contain standard boilerplate language asserting on behalf of each claimant a claim for damages of million compensatory and million punitive against approximately defendants 
approximately claims set forth the same boilerplate language asserting million in compensatory and million in punitive damages on behalf of each claimant against approximately defendants 
approximately cases assert million in compensatory and million in punitive damages on behalf of each claimant against approximately defendants 
approximately claimants seek compensatory damages of less than  per claim and approximately claimants seek compensatory damages between million and million 
the claims involved in the foregoing cases do not specify against which defendants which claims are made or alleged dates of exposure 
based upon settled or concluded claims to date  the company has not identified any correlation between the amount of the relief sought in the complaint and the final value of the claim 
the company and its insurers are vigorously defending these actions 
during fiscal year  the company experienced no material changes in its bodily injury liabilities and insurance receivables 
at both march  and march   respectively  the company had recorded bodily injury liability reserves of million and bodily injury insurance receivables of million 
these bodily injury liabilities and receivables are classified within the company s consolidated balance sheets as environmental and other reserves  and insurance receivables  respectively 
the company has entered into agreements with several of its insurers to provide coverage for a significant portion of settlements and awards related to these bodily injury claims 
these agreements have aggregate limits on amounts to be paid overall and formulas for amounts of payment on individual claims 
the two most significant agreements provide coverage applicable to claims of exposure to asbestos occurring between and and occurring between through insurance coverage for exposures to asbestos was no longer available from the insurance industry after due to changes in federal regulations in the s that resulted in the swift decline in commercial and military application of asbestos and increased regulation over the handling and removal of asbestos  there exists minimal risk of claims arising from exposure after contractual formulas are utilized to determine the amount of coverage from each agreement on each claim settled or litigated 
once the initial date of alleged exposure to asbestos is determined  all contractual years subsequent to that date participate in the settlement 
since all known claims involve alleged exposure prior to  the through agreement will participate in the settlement or judgement of all outstanding claims that are settled or litigated 
as a result  and as the years remaining calculation set forth below indicates  the through agreement will exhaust prior to the through agreement 
based on historical claims settlement data only  the company projects that at march   the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years and the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years 
at march   the company projected that these agreements would provide coverage for an additional years and years  respectively 
the company resolved malignant claims in compared with in and in if historical settlement patterns or the rate of filing for new cases change in future periods  these estimated coverage periods could be shorter or longer than anticipated 
moreover  if one or both of these coverages are exhausted at some future date  the company s share of responsibility will increase for any subsequent claims and for legal expenses previously covered by these insurance agreements 
in addition to providing coverage for assessments or settlements of claims  the agreements also provide for costs of defending and processing such claims 
due to uncertainties of the number of cases  the extent of alleged damages  the population of claimants and size of any awards and or settlements  there can be no assurance that the current reserves will be adequate to cover the costs of resolving the existing cases 
additionally  the company cannot predict the eventual number of cases to be filed against it or their eventual resolution and does not include in its reserve amounts for cases that may be filed in the future 
however  it is probable that if future cases are filed against the company it will result in additional costs arising either from its share of costs under current insurance in place arrangements or due to the exhaustion of such coverage 
the company reviews the adequacy of existing reserves periodically based upon developments affecting these claims  including new filings and resolutions  and makes adjustments to the reserve and related insurance receivable as appropriate 
as the company is not able to estimate its potential ultimate exposure for filed and unfiled claims against the company  it cannot predict whether the ultimate resolution of the bodily injury cases will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or stockholders equity 
liquidity  capital resources and working capital at march   the company s cash and cash equivalents  and securities available for sale balances were million and million  respectively  for a total of million 
at march  the company s cash and cash equivalents  and securities available for sale balances were million and million  respectively  for a total of million 
the company anticipates that its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities position  anticipated fiscal year cash flow  access to credit facilities and capital markets  taken together  will provide sufficient liquidity to fund operations for fiscal year accordingly  shipyard capital expenditures are expected to be financed from working capital 
a change in the composition or timing of projected work could cause planned capital expenditures and repair and maintenance expenditures to change 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended march  this amount was primarily attributable to fiscal year net income adjusted for environmental and other reserves and accounts receivable  offset by increases in insurance receivables 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended march  and was primarily attributable to fiscal year net income adjusted for depreciation and deferred taxes 
investing cash flows net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended march  and consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended march  and consisted primarily of maturities and sales of marketable securities offset partially by purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures during fiscal year  the company spent approximately million on new capital assets 
this represents an increase of approximately million from the million spent in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year capital expenditures is primarily attributable to the design costs associated with the replacement of one of the company s existing piers 
activities associated with the pier replacement project will continue into fiscal year and are an integral part of the company s special capital budget that was announced subsequent to the end of fiscal year on april   the company s board of directors announced a special capital budget for its fiscal years and of approximately million for improvements to its seattle shipyard facility 
these improvements  which include the replacement of the previously mentioned pier  a stormwater collection and discharge system and significant upgrades to its electrical system  will be in addition to the company s routine annual capital expenditures 
the company plans to finance these capital projects from its projected future cash flows and existing working capital 
the capital expenditures for fiscal year are in addition to ongoing repair and maintenance expenditures in the shipyard of million  million  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year repair and maintenance costs when compared to fiscal year are primarily attributable to the company s multi year refurbishment plan of its owned dry dock 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was thousand 
this consisted primarily of a reduction in restricted cash and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by the purchase of treasury stock 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  the company declared a dividend of ten cents per share payable on june   to shareholders of record as of june   and quarterly thereafter 
the impact of this dividend payment based on the current number of outstanding shares will be approximately million quarterly 
the dividend is the first dividend declared by the company since emerging from bankruptcy reorganization in net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year was million 
cash used in financing activities during fiscal year consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock resulting from the company s dutch auction that was completed during the second quarter of fiscal year credit facility in fiscal year  todd pacific shipyards corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  negotiated a million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility  which is renewable on a bi annual basis  provides todd pacific with greater flexibility in funding its operational cash flow needs 
certain todd pacific trade receivables  equipment and inventory secure this revolving credit facility 
todd pacific had no outstanding borrowings as of march  and march   respectively commitments the company is subject to certain minimum operating lease payments on two of its dry docks that are charged to expense 
these operating leases contain renewal options and minimum amounts of annual maintenance requirements 
the minimum lease commitments are summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a surety company has issued contract bonds totaling million for current repair  maintenance and conversion jobs as of march  todd pacific s trade accounts receivable on certain bonded jobs secure these various contract bonds 
stock repurchase during the third quarter of fiscal year  the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock from time to time in open market or negotiated transactions 
under this authorization  the company repurchased an aggregate of  shares during the balance of fiscal year in open market transactions at an average price of per share for total consideration of  also during fiscal year   shares of treasury stock were reissued pursuant to the exercise of stock options held by two officers of the company 
 shares were held as treasury stock as of march  during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company announced a tender offer for up to million shares of the company s common stock at a price of not in excess of or less than per share 
the exact price was determined by a procedure commonly referred to as a dutch auction 
the million shares that the company offered to repurchase from existing stockholders represented approximately of the total number of shares outstanding at that time 
following verification of the tenders and receipt of shares tendered subject to guarantees of delivery  an aggregate of  shares were validly tendered at a price of per share 
in accordance with the terms of its offer  the company elected to increase the number of shares to be purchased in order to avoid proration procedures otherwise applicable to the offer  resulting in an aggregate purchase price of million 
the company incurred expenses in connection with this offer of approximately million 
the company utilized available cash and proceeds from available for sale securities to fund the share repurchases completed through the offer 
the share repurchase had a favorable impact on net income per common share eps in fiscal year by increasing basic eps by cents per share and diluted eps by cents per share

accounting changes beginning in fiscal year  the company elected to apply the expense recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the recognition provisions are applied prospectively to all employee awards granted  modified or settled after march  under the transition provisions of fas no 
and as amended by fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure  no cumulative effect is recorded for this accounting change 
the company has adopted fas no 
as it is designated as the preferred method of accounting for stock based compensation 
previously  the company had applied the disclosure only provisions of fas no 
and accounted for stock based compensation using the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of the company s common stock at the date of grant over the stock option price 
no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in fiscal year and  net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying common stock at the date of the grant 
during fiscal year  the company did not grant any new stock options and therefore there is no expense recorded under fas no 
note  item j to the consolidated financial statements includes pro forma information as if the expense recognition provisions of fas no 
were applied to stock option grants for all periods presented  based on the valuation of the option as of the date of the grants 
since the expense recognition provisions of fas no 
apply to stock options granted subsequent to march   the company cannot presently determine the financial impact that this change will have on its future results of operations or financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  fiscal year for the company 
fas no 
provides accounting and reporting standards for recognizing obligations related to asset retirement costs associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
under fas no 
 legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets are to be recognized at fair value in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and expensed using a systematic and rational method over the assets useful lives 
any subsequent changes to the fair value of the liability will be expensed 
the company has evaluated the impact of fas no 
and based on its evaluation believes that adoption will not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas no 
 which is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  under fas no 
 a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity will be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
fas no 
nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring issue 
the principal difference between fas no 
and issue relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
fas no 
will only impact the company if it incurs exit or disposal activities 
if and when an exit or disposal activity occurs  management will record such activity under the rules of fas no 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin no 

fin no 
will significantly change current practice in the accounting for  and disclosure of  guarantees 
guarantees meeting the characteristics described in fin no 
are required to be initially recorded at fair value  which is different from the general current practice of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable  as those terms are defined in fas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin no 
also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures for virtually all guarantees even when the likelihood of the guarantor s having to make payments under the guarantee is remote 
fin no 
will not currently have an impact on the company s disclosures in its form k 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure fas no 
 which is effective for fiscal years ending after december  fas no 
amends fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  fas no 
amends the disclosure provisions of fas no 
to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
as stated above  the company elected to adopt the fair value method of accounting for employee stock based compensation in accordance with fas no 
on a prospective basis 
accordingly  the company accounts for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb no 
for stock based awards granted prior to april  and thus applies the disclosure only provisions of fas no 
to such awards

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company does not own any derivative financial instruments as of march   nor does it presently plan to in the future 
however  the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
the company s interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and certain marketable securities 
the company s marketable securities are also subject to the inherent market risks and exposures of the related debt and equity securities in both us and foreign markets 
the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in the market risk of its marketable securities 
the company believes that the risk associated with interest rate and market fluctuations related to these marketable securities is not a material risk based on a sensitivity analysis 
the company is exposed to potential interest rate risk on its revolving credit facility 
interest charged on the company s credit facility is based on the prime lending rate  which may fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates 
increases in the prime lending rate could increase the company s borrowing costs under its existing credit facility 
the company believes that the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations related to its credit facility is not a material risk 
the company is also exposed to potential increases in future health care cost trend rates 
increases in these trend rates could have a significant affect on the amounts reported by the company for its health care plans 
the company reports in note to the financial statements the effects of a change in the health care cost trend rates
