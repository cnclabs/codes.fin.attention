revenues 
revenues consist of service fees charged by the company to cover the costs of certain employment related taxes  workers compensation insurance coverage and administrative and field services provided by the company to its clients 
the service fee charged by the company is invoiced along with each periodic payroll delivered to the client 
the client s portion of health plan costs is charged separately and is not included in the service fee 
service revenues are recognized in the period in which the worksite employee works 
under this accrual method of accounting  service fees relating to worksite employees with earned but unpaid wages at the end of each period are recognized as unbilled revenues and the related payroll costs for such wages are accrued as a liability during the period in which the worksite employee earns wages 
subsequent to the end of each period  such wages are paid and the related service fees are billed 
cost of services 
cost of services includes all direct costs associated with the company s revenue generating activities as well as employee benefit costs  workers compensation insurance and state unemployment taxes 
employee benefit costs are comprised primarily of medical benefit costs  but also include costs of other employee benefits such as dental  disability and group life insurance 
benefit claims incurred by worksite employees under the benefit plans are expensed as incurred according to the terms of each contract 
worksite employee participation and the client s contribution towards the cost of the company s health benefit plans are at an established minimum 
in certain instances  the company opts to make a contribution toward the cost of the worksite employees medical benefit costs 
in most small group health markets  medical benefit plan rates vary based on the medical participants demographics 
in order to offer a competitively priced business solution  the company may offer reduced medical benefit plan rates to worksite employees with positive risk characteristics 
the addition of these selected worksite employees offsets potential adverse selection and helps to stabilize the overall medical benefit plan risk to the company 
in addition  a medical benefit plan price subsidy may be used to mitigate medical benefit plan renewal rate increases in a particular state or region of the country 

table of contents the amount of the company s contribution toward medical benefit plan costs is determined as part of the annual enrollment pricing process 
a health benefit plan subsidy in excess of a planned amount may occur when medical benefit cost inflation exceeds expected inflation levels or when medical benefit plan enrollment in subsidized states is greater than anticipated 
the company offers its medical benefit plans through partnerships with premier health care companies 
see health benefit plans beginning on page these companies have extensive provider networks and strong reputations in the markets in which the company operates

the company reviews the current program year claims information with its independent actuaries 
the current accrual rate is adjusted based on current and historical loss trends  fluctuations in the administrative costs associated with the program  actual returns on investment earned with respect to premium dollars paid and changes in the discount rate used to determine the present value of future payments to be made under the program 
in addition  each year  the company evaluates its historical accruals based on an actuarially developed estimate of the ultimate cost to the company for each open policy year and adjusts such accruals as necessary 
these adjustments could be either increases or decreases to workers compensation costs  depending upon the actual loss experience of the company 
the final costs of coverage will be determined by the actual claims experience over time as claims close  by the final administrative costs of the program and by the final return on investment earned with respect to premium dollars paid 
see workers compensation plans beginning on page state unemployment tax rates vary from state to state and are based upon the employer s claims history 
the company aggressively manages its state unemployment tax exposure by contesting unwarranted claims 
operating expenses 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries  wages and commissions associated with the company s internal employees  and general and administrative expenses 
sales and marketing commissions and client referral fees are expensed as incurred

critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those that the company considers critical in preparing its financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
the descriptions below are summarized and have been simplified for clarity 
a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies used by the company in preparing its financial statements is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements and in item of this form k 
revenue recognition 
the gross billings that the company charges its clients under its professional services agreement include each worksite employee s gross wages  a service fee and  to the extent elected by the clients  health and welfare benefit plan costs 
the company s service fee  which is computed as a percentage of gross wages  is intended to yield a profit to the company and cover the cost of certain employment related taxes  workers compensation insurance coverage  and administrative and field services provided by the company to the client  including payroll administration  record keeping  and safety  human resources  and regulatory compliance consultation 
the component of the service fee related to administration varies according to the size of the client  the amount and frequency of payroll payments and the method of delivery of such payments 
the component of the service fee related to workers compensation and unemployment insurance is based  in part  on the client s historical claims experience 
all charges by the company are invoiced along with each periodic payroll delivered to the client 
historically the company reported the full amount of its gross billings  including the portion that represents the gross wages of its worksite employees  as revenue 
as described below  the company changed from gross revenue reporting to net revenue reporting for worksite employee salaries  wages and certain payroll taxes effective for the fourth quarter of the company reports revenues from service fees in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company reports as revenues  
table of contents on a gross basis  the total amount billed to clients for service fees  health and welfare benefit plan fees  workers compensation and unemployment insurance fees 
the company reports revenues on a gross basis for these fees because the company is the primary obligor and deemed to be the principal in these transactions under eitf no 
the company now reports revenues on a net basis for the amount billed to clients for worksite employee salaries  wages and certain payroll related taxes less amounts paid to worksite employees and taxing authorities for these salaries  wages and taxes 
the company accounts for its revenues using the accrual method of accounting 
under the accrual method of accounting  the company recognizes its revenues in the period in which the worksite employee performs work 
the company accrues revenues and unbilled receivables for service fees relating to work performed by worksite employees but unpaid at the end of each period 
in addition  the related costs of services are accrued as a liability for the same period 
subsequent to the end of each period  such costs are paid and the related peo service fees are billed 
accounting change for reporting revenue 
during the quarter ended december   the company changed from gross revenue reporting to net revenue reporting for worksite employee salaries  wages and payroll related taxes 
based on the criteria established by eitf no 
 the company determined that this change better recognizes the substance of the transactions between the company and its clients 
in addition  the change will better focus the company on  and allow investors to better understand  the financial results of the company s core business 
this change to a more preferable accounting method resulted in no effect on net income or earnings per share 
because of the significance of this reclassification of revenue and expense components to the income statement  the company has reflected the change as if it had occurred on january  in the accompanying financial statements 
the table presented below reflects the effect of the change on the amounts previously reported for and and the amounts that would have been reported for under the gross revenue reporting method 
for the year ended december  in thousands gross revenue reporting method reclassification net revenue reporting method revenues cost of services gross profit operating expenses net income loss for the year ended december  in thousands gross revenue reporting method reclassification net revenue reporting method revenues cost of services gross profit operating expenses net income loss 
table of contents for the year ended december  in thousands gross revenue reporting method reclassification net revenue reporting method revenues cost of services gross profit operating expenses net income loss medical benefit plan liabilities 
the company provides medical benefit plans to its worksite employees through several medical benefits plan providers 
with respect to these medical benefit plans  the company establishes medical benefit plan liabilities for benefit claims that have been reported but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these reserves and the related health benefit plan subsidy are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider a number of factors  including historical claim payment patterns and expected rates of increase in medical care costs 
the factor that has the greatest impact on the company s financial results is the medical cost trend  which is the rate of increase in health care costs 
in certain instances  the company decides to make a contribution to the medical benefit plan providers toward the cost of the worksite employees medical benefit plan costs 
such contribution together with higher than anticipated medical cost trend may result in what the company has designated to be a health benefit plan subsidy 
for each period  the company estimates the relevant factors  based primarily on historical data and uses this information to determine the assumptions underlying the reserve calculations 
an extensive degree of judgment is used in this estimation process 
due to the considerable variability of health care costs and adjustments to health reserves  the health benefit plan subsidy is paid by the company and is sometimes significant 
the following tables provides the amount of the health benefit plan subsidy by year and the amount of the medical benefit plan liabilities for benefit claims that have been reported but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported health benefit plan subsidy year ended december  december  december  health benefit plan subsidy medical benefit plan liabilities year ended december  december  medical benefit plan liabilities if the actual amount of the company s medical benefit plan liabilities at the end of each period were to increase from the estimates used by the company  then the company would have an increase in the amount of its future period health benefit plan subsidy 
the company s financial statements reflect the estimates made within the cost of services on the company s income statement and within the accrued insurance premiums  health and workers compensation reserves on the company s balance sheet 

table of contents in order to give recognition to the medical benefit plan liabilities that are not expected to be paid in the following year  the company includes a portion of the obligation as a long term liability 
workers compensation plan liabilities 
the company had an insured loss sensitive workers compensation program with cna for  and as part of such program the company has individual stop loss coverage at million per occurrence and aggregate stop loss coverage for individual claims that in total exceed the aggregate stop loss amount of of expected losses as determined by cna 
commencing with the policy year which began on january   aig became the company s workers compensation carrier under a one year agreement 
such workers compensation program is loss sensitive and will provide the company with individual stop loss coverage at million per occurrence and aggregate stop loss coverage for individual claims that in total exceed the aggregate stop loss amount of of expected losses as determined by aig 
at least annually  the company obtains an independent actuarially determined calculation of the estimated costs of claims incurred based on the company s historical loss development trends 
the estimated costs of the claims calculated may be subsequently revised by the independent actuary based on developments relating to the actual claims incurred 
a certain amount of judgment is used in this estimation process by both the independent actuary and the company 
the following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over time of reserves established for workers compensation claims and claims adjustment expenses at the end of the preceding three calendar years for the company 
this table excludes the program year for the texas workers compensation insurance fund  which was a guarantee cost program 
the second section  reading down  shows the number of claims reported 
the third section  reading down  shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to the originally reported reserve liability 
the last section  reading down  shows re estimates of the originally recorded reserves as of the end of each successive year  which is the result of the company s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
year ended december  december  december  originally reported reserves for unpaid claims and claims expenses limited to million per occurrence number of claims reported as of end of initial year one year later two years later cumulative net paid claims as of end of initial year one year later two years later undiscounted reserves re estimated as of end of initial year one year later two years later the loss reserve development table for workers compensation claims is cumulative and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years 

table of contents the company s financial statements reflect the estimates made by the independent actuaries as well as other factors related to the cna workers compensation program within the cost of services on the company s income statement and within the accrued insurance premiums  health and workers compensation insurance reserves on the company s balance sheet 
if the actual cost of the claims incurred is higher than the estimates determined by the independent actuaries  then the accrual rate used to determine workers compensation costs could increase 
if the actual cost of the claims incurred is lower than the estimates determined by the independent actuaries  then the accrual rate used to determine workers compensation costs could decrease 
such increase or decrease to the accrual rate is reflected in the accounting period that the change in the amount of workers compensation claims is calculated 
due to the considerable variability in the estimate of the amount of workers compensation claims  adjustments to workers compensation costs are sometimes significant 
in order to give recognition to these workers compensation cost obligations that are not expected to be paid in the following year  the company includes a portion of the obligation as a long term liability 
deferred taxes 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and if necessary  establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if the company were to operate at a loss or is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  then the company could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of the deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in the company s effective tax rate

table of contents significant trends client retention the company decided in to target new clients with a lower risk profile and to no longer service existing clients in certain high risk industries 
during the first quarter of  all existing clients in certain high risk industries such as roofing and trucking were terminated 
however  the company will continue to service existing clients in other high risk industries and intends to retain such clients for as long as they remain profitable to the company 
as a result  the percentage of total company revenue earned from clients in high risk industries is expected to decrease over time as the revenue earned from new clients added from other industries increases 
the company considers industries to be high risk if there is a likelihood of a high frequency of on the job accidents involving worksite employees or likelihood that such accidents will be severe 
by no longer selling its services to new high risk clients  the company believes that it will reduce the earnings volatility associated with the cost of its workers compensation insurance programs 
volatility in the dollar amount of workers compensation costs arises when the number of accidents and the severity of such accidents cannot be easily projected  thus resulting in a wide range of possible expected dollar losses for an insurance policy year 
such volatility in the projection of expected dollar losses caused by the number of claims and the severity of such claims is more likely to be associated with industries that have a high risk level associated with them eg  construction  roofing  trucking  etc 
since the company has historically sold a significant amount of its services to clients in high risk industries  there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether it can be successful in selling services to clients in industries not previously focused upon 
the company has been selling to the new target market since the first quarter of and the sales volume from new clients has been at a level that leads the company to believe that the result of the transition is profitable 
further  the company has communicated to its existing clients that the comprehensive service fees  including the cost of medical benefits  will increase in to more appropriately recognize the company s cost of providing services and to decrease the health benefit subsidy 
the repricing of the company s services is consistent with its strategy to charge service fees that more accurately reflect current competitive market rates for insurance and benefit related services 
the company is not able to predict the degree of client attrition that will result from the increased service fees 
business insurance the company maintains a number of corporate insurance policies  including automobile liability and general liability 
for the program years of and prior  these insurance policies were on a guaranteed cost basis 
for the program years  the automobile and general liability insurance policies will be subject to a deductible amount per incident 
in addition  the company will provide aig with  of collateral to protect against this exposure 
the company is continuing to seek insurance coverage with lower deductible amounts for this exposure 
surety bonds through  the company used surety bonds as collateral for its workers compensation insurance programs 
as of january   surety bonds will no longer be used to collateralize workers compensations programs 
collateral obligations will be met through the use of cash and cash equivalents 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   revenues increased over  totaling million  compared to million for revenue growth was primarily due to the company s strategy of emphasizing its human resources consulting services that it provides to its clients in order to increase the administrative fees that it earns 
in addition  revenues increased as the company increased the charge for its health benefit plans offered to worksite employees and the number of worksite employees participating in the company s health benefit plans increased 

table of contents charges to clients for workers compensation coverage as a percentage of worksite employees salaries and wages for was  compared to for  representing a decrease of

to the extent the company continues to increase the number of its low risk clients  the company expects such charges to continue to decrease 
from december  to december   the number of clients decreased from  to  and the number of average paid worksite employees decreased from  to  such declines are a result of the company s decision to target new clients with a lower risk profile and to no longer service existing clients in certain high risk industries
