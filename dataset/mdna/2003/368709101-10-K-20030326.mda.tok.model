item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in item of this report 
overview we are a diversified biotechnology company that develops and delivers products and services to the industrial  consumer  agri processing and health care markets 
our current revenues result primarily from the sale of enzyme products to the cleaning  grain processing and textile industries  with the remainder of our revenues from research funding  fees and royalties 
we intend to apply our proven and proprietary technologies and manufacturing capabilities to expand sales in our existing markets and address new opportunities in the health care  agri processing  industrial  and consumer markets 
we have formed  and plan to continue to form  strategic alliances with market leaders to collaborate with us to develop and launch products 
we manufacture our products at our eight manufacturing facilities which are located in the united states  finland  belgium  china and argentina 
we conduct our sales and marketing activities through our direct sales organizations in the united states  the netherlands  singapore  japan  china and argentina and through distributors in selected markets and geographies 
in   and we derived approximately of our revenues from our foreign operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparation of those financial statements  we apply various accounting policies 
we also make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
although our accounting policies and certain estimates and assumptions are disclosed within the notes to our consolidated financial statements  the following is a discussion of the accounting policies  estimates and assumptions we believe are most critical 
principles of consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority owned subsidiaries 
investments in affiliates in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  are accounted for by the equity method  which means that our investment in those entities is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect capital contributions made  dividends received and our respective share of such affiliate s earnings or losses 
all other investments in affiliates  which are not material to our financial statements  are carried at cost 
in the normal course of business  we engage in transactions among our affiliated entities 
these intercompany transactions are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
all of our investments are in operating or corporate holding companies  some of which may qualify under the definition of variable interest entities as defined in financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
while we have no material investments in variable interest entities  all such investments have been appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements or otherwise disclosed in the notes thereto 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies comply with the guidance contained in the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
our revenues consist of product revenues and fees and royalty revenues 
fees and royalty revenues consist primarily of funded research  technology and license fees and royalties 
our revenues are heavily influenced by business with our major customers 
please refer to the discussion of major customers included in item of this report 
product revenue revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to customers 
we group our existing products into three general categories enzymes that break down protein  enzymes that break down starch and enzymes that break down cellulose 
funded research research funding revenues result from collaborative agreements with various parties  including the us government  whereby we perform research activities and receive revenues that partially reimburse expenses incurred 
under such agreements we retain a proprietary interest in the products and technology developed 
these expense reimbursements primarily consist of direct expense sharing arrangements and milestone payments 
revenues related to expense sharing arrangements are recorded as the underlying expenses are incurred 
milestone payments are contingent upon successful completion of research activities and are recognized upon satisfaction of those contingencies 
upfront research funding payments are recognized as revenues on a straight line basis over the term of the underlying research agreement 
our funded research revenues are fully dependent upon our progress on the underlying collaborative research projects and can vary from period to period 
technology and license fees fees from the sale of technology are recognized upon completion of the required technology transfer and substantial satisfaction of any performance related responsibilities 
license fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the term defined in the license agreement 
in the event there is no defined term  such as with permanent licenses  license fees are recognized upon substantial satisfaction of any performance related responsibilities 
our technology and license fees can vary from period to period as a result of the number and timing of such transactions 
royalty revenue royalty revenue is recognized in accordance with the underlying contract terms 
research and development we expense research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expenses include  but are not limited to  expenses for services rendered related to our funded research activities 
accordingly  in the event our funded research revenues fluctuate from period to period  the related research and development expenses may also fluctuate 
investments in equity securities we hold minority interests in equity securities of certain publicly traded and privately held companies having operations or technology within our strategic area of focus 
while we are selective in making such investments  once we have obtained the securities  we are at risk for fluctuations in their fair market value 
if these securities experience declines in value which we consider to be other than temporary  we will record an impairment charge to the extent of that decline in value 
poor operating results experienced by these entities or adverse changes in market conditions in the future may cause losses or an inability to recover our carrying value of these investments 
in  we recorded an investment loss of million as a result of such circumstances 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
other intangible assets primarily include patents  licenses  technology  and customer lists 
investments in long lived assets are initially recorded at acquisition cost 
we recognize depreciation on all property  plant and equipment  except land  using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from years 
we also amortize our other intangible assets  except technology  on a straight line basis over estimated lives of years 
land  goodwill and technology are considered to have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not subject to depreciation or amortization 
at least annually  we evaluate whether the remaining useful lives of our depreciable and amortizable assets are appropriate 
changes in these useful lives can result in either increases or decreases in the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in our statement of operations  reflecting shorter or longer lives  respectively 
in addition  we regularly assess all of our long lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
this is accomplished by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets with the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment 
should aggregate future cash flows be less than the carrying value  a write down would be required  measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
fair value is estimated either through independent valuation or as the present value of expected discounted future cash flows 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows exceed the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment  no impairment is recognized 
our judgments related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability of the company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
while we believe the long lived asset amounts recorded in our balance sheet are properly stated as of december   as we make future assessments of the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long lived assets  these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges 
during  we recognized an impairment charge of million for certain assets in connection with our restructuring activities 
please refer to the discussion under the subheading restructuring activities included later in this section 
defined benefit pension and post retirement plans as part of our overall employee benefits program  we have defined benefit pension plans and a defined benefit postretirement plan 
the assets  liabilities and related expense of these plans are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the estimated market related value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  discount rates  rates of increase of health care costs  rates of future compensation increases and other assumptions inherent in these valuations 
our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
we annually review the assumptions underlying the actuarial calculations and makes changes to these assumptions as necessary 
stock based compensation the genencor international  inc omnibus incentive plan the oi plan became effective on may  upon approval by the stockholders at our annual meeting of stockholders 
employees  outside directors  consultants  advisors and independent contractors retained by the company are eligible to participate in the oi plan 
the plan allows for the grant  at not less than of the estimated market value as of the date of grant  of non qualified and incentive stock options to purchase the company s common stock and stock appreciation rights sars  based on the underlying value of the company s common stock 
the oi plan also allows for the grant of restricted and unrestricted stock awards  performance shares stock or stock based awards contingent upon attaining performance objectives or performance units units valued by reference to chosen criteria 
under the terms of the oi plan  the company has the ability to grant awards representing up to million shares of common stock 
in addition  any shares remaining  or shares that become available under the predecessor plan will be available for grant of awards under the oi plan 
generally  stock options and sars vest and become exercisable  and the restrictions  if any  on stock awards shall expire  ratably over a three year period and expire years from their grant date 
we use the intrinsic value method to account for stock based employee compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and have no current plans to convert to the fair value method 
under the intrinsic value method  no compensation expense is recorded for grants of stock based awards when the grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
should the exercise price be below the fair market value on the date of grant  we record this difference as a component of stockholders equity and amortize it as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the stock based award 
for more information regarding our stock based awards  including pro forma disclosures of compensation expense had we employed the fair value method under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  please refer to note employee benefit plans included within item of this report 
income taxes the benefit from provision for income taxes included within our statement of operations is based upon pretax financial accounting income loss and is calculated using the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
significant estimates are required in determining our benefit from provision for income taxes 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future consolidated effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing laws or regulations  future acquisitions or mergers  future levels of research and development spending  future levels of capital expenditures  and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings 
furthermore  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit by regulatory authorities in these jurisdictions 
these tax audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we believe that we have appropriately calculated our benefit from provision for income taxes in light of these uncertainties

new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted this statement as of january  this statement requires the recognition of separately identifiable intangible assets 
furthermore  it establishes amortization requirements based upon the ability of the intangible assets to provide cash flows 
for those intangible assets with readily identifiable useful lives  amortization will be recorded in the statement of operations over such lives 
intangible assets  such as goodwill  which have indefinite lives  will not result in periodic amortization  but must be tested at least annually for impairment 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 we reassessed the useful lives and residual values of all acquired intangible assets to make any necessary amortization period adjustments 
based on that assessment  goodwill and certain previously acquired technology were determined to have indefinite useful lives 
also  there were no adjustments made to the amortization periods or residual values of other intangible assets 
accordingly  certain reclassifications were made to previously issued financial statements to conform to the presentation required by sfas no 
we completed the first step of the transitional goodwill and indefinite lived intangible impairment tests and have determined that no potential impairment exists 
as a result  we recognized no transitional impairment loss in fiscal in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset be recorded as a liability when those obligations are incurred  with the amount of the liability initially measured at fair value 
upon initially recognizing a liability for an asset retirement obligation  an entity must capitalize the cost by recognizing an increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be required to be adopted by us in fiscal the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or our results of operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no

this statement requires the measurement of long lived assets at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas no

 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the emerging issues task force eitf has set forth in eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas no 
also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and certain termination benefits provided to employees under the terms of one time benefit arrangements 
sfas no 
will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation fin no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of others indebtedness 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation also incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we believe that the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our financial position or our results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fsas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas no 
does not permit the use of the original sfas no 
prospective method of transition for changes to the fair value based method made in fiscal years after december  we currently apply the intrinsic value method and have no plans to convert to the fair value method 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation requires companies to reevaluate their accounting for certain investments in variable interest entities 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
variable interest entities are to be consolidated if the company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
we have no material investments in variable interest entities  all such investments have been appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements or otherwise disclosed in the notes thereto 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk and interest rate risk are the primary sources of our market risk 
to date foreign operations  mainly denominated in euros  accounted for approximately of our revenues 
we believe that we partially mitigate this risk by locating our manufacturing facilities so that the costs are denominated in the same currency as our product revenues 
we may manage the foreign currency exposures that remain through the use of foreign currency forward contracts  currency options and off setting currency loans where deemed appropriate 
we do not use these instruments for speculative purposes 
at december   there were no forward contracts or option contracts outstanding 
we recorded million in foreign currency gains related to forward contracts in the statement of operations for the year ended december  as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
of this amount  million was denominated in euros 
the remainder or million was primarily denominated in us dollars 
other than the second installment of million due in march  under our senior notes discussed under the heading liquidity and capital resources  in item of this report  short term debt outstanding at december  was not significant 
to the extent us dollar and euro interest rates fluctuate either up or down  the return on the cash investments will also fluctuate 
to the extent such euro cash investments remain outstanding  we will be subject to the risks of future foreign exchange fluctuations and the impact on the translation of these cash investments into us dollars 
interest rates our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of short term interest rates primarily in the united states and europe 
in this regard  changes in the us dollar and euro currency rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents  short term investments  and long term investments 
our interest expense is generated primarily from fixed rate debt  which consists of million senior notes outstanding at december   maturing in four remaining annual installments of million from march  through march  on january   we entered into an interest rate swap contract to pay a variable rate of interest based on the six month london interbank offered rate libor and receive fixed rates of interest at on a million notional amount of our long term indebtedness 
on may   we entered into another interest rate swap contract to pay a variable rate of interest based on the six month libor and receive fixed rates of interest at on an additional million notional amount of our long term indebtedness 
on july  we sold both swap contracts for approximately million in cash 
the gain on the sale will be amortized against interest expense over the original maturity date of the swaps 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  these interest rate swap contracts that hedged the senior notes had an immaterial effect on the statement of operations and were not material to the balance sheet as of the date of their sale 
foreign currency exposure we conduct business throughout the world 
to date  we have derived approximately of our revenues and approximately all of our operating income from foreign operations 
economic conditions in countries where we conduct business and changing foreign currency exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations 
we are exposed to changes in exchange rates in europe  latin america  and asia 
the euro presents our most significant foreign currency exposure risk 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates  especially the strengthening of the us dollar  may have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations as they are expressed in us dollars 
we recorded a million gain from us dollar euro transactions through the year ended december  due to the strengthening of the euro 
our manufacturing and administrative operations for latin america are located in argentina 
severe economic conditions  resulted in a year end devaluation of the argentine peso 
as a result  our subsidiary  which has an argentine peso functional currency  reported lower us dollar net assets due to the translation impact resulting from the devaluation 
due to the fact that a significant part of our latin american revenues were denominated in us dollars  our statement of operations reflected a million foreign currency gain from the remeasurement of related accounts receivable through the year ended december  management monitors foreign currency exposures and may in the ordinary course of business enter into foreign currency forward contracts or options contracts related to specific foreign currency transactions or anticipated cash flows 
these contracts generally cover periods of nine months or less and are not material 
we recorded a gain of million in the statement of operations for the year ended december  from foreign currency contracts 
we do not hedge the translation of financial statements of consolidated subsidiaries that maintain their local books and records in foreign currencies 
other the risk factors discussed in item of this report are incorporated herein by reference to the degree they address market risk
