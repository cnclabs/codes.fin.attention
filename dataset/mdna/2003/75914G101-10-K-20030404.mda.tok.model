in june  we acquired inabox  inc and we used inabox s software to develop our firststepsite and websitenow products and my 
register 
com  one of the reseller solutions offered to our global partner network 
we acquired inabox  inc for million cash and  shares of our common stock 
in september  we acquired afternic 
com  inc  a secondary market exchange for domain names  for million cash and  shares of our common stock 
each of these transactions was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  the financial results of inabox and afternic 
com are consolidated with our financial results from the dates of their respective acquisitions 
we made a decision to abandon the afternic business in september 
back to contents on march  we acquired virtual internet plc for million us million at date of acquisition 
virtual internet plc  a uk based company  has operations in the united states and europe and  at the time of acquisition  operated through two divisions the corporate services division and the hosting division 
the corporate services division provides online intellectual property management and protection services and the hosting division provided web hosting services 
in may  we sold virtual internet plc s hosting division for million 
virtual internet plc shareholders  other than shareholders in certain jurisdictions outside of the uk  were given the opportunity to elect to receive loan notes from register 
com uk limited in exchange for their shares and million of these loan notes were outstanding at december  we expect these notes to be repaid on or before june  our results of operations for include those of virtual internet s corporate services business since march  significant accounting policies net revenues we derive our net revenues from domain name registrations  other products and services and advertising 
we earn registration fees in connection with new  renewed  extended and transferred in registrations 
registration periods generally range from one to ten years 
domain name registration revenues are deferred at the time of the registration and are recognized ratably over the term of the registration period 
under this subscription based model  we recognize revenue over the period of the subscription term during which we provide the registration services  including customer service and maintenance of the individual domain name records 
we require prepayment via credit card for most online domain name registration sales  which provides us with the full cash fee at the beginning of the registration period while we recognize the revenues over the registration period 
for many of our customers who register domain names through our corporate services division  and for many participants in our global partner network  we establish lines of credit based on credit worthiness 
under current credit card industry practices  we are liable for fraudulent and disputed credit card transactions because we do not obtain the cardholder s signature at the time of the transaction  even though the financial institution issuing the credit card may have approved the transaction 
as a result  we must estimate the amount of credit card chargebacks we will receive in the future related to credit card sales in the current period 
in determining our estimate  we review historical rates of credit card chargebacks  current economic trends and changes in acceptance of our products and services on a monthly basis 
deferred revenues and revenues recognized are presented net of provisions recorded for estimated refunds to customers and chargebacks from credit card associations 
the credit card associations may impose financial penalties if our chargebacks and refunds exceed certain thresholds 
such penalties are not charged to revenues  but are classified as general and administrative expense 
if a significant percentage of customers continue to request refunds from us or contact their bank to request that the amount charged to their credit card be charged back to us based on claims that their credit card was used fraudulently or without their consent  our business could be materially adversely affected 
see risk factors and note to the consolidated financial statements contingencies and commitments credit card penalties for additional information in connection with the penalties that may be imposed by credit card associations and other risks associated with the company s excessive credit card chargebacks and refunds 

back to contents in addition to our standard registration fees published on our www 
register 
com website  we have a number of different fee structures for our domain name registration services 
our corporate services division delivers a diversified range of higher priced services for our corporate customers and extends volume based discounts for domain name registrations and transfers 
we pay referral commissions to certain participants in our global partner network and to participants in our affiliate network 
other participants in our global partner network pay us a wholesale price per registration  discounted off of our standard registration fee 
we believe that the high growth rate experienced in the domain name registration marketplace in late and is not an indication of anticipated future growth rates 
during that period substantial numbers of domain name registrations were driven by factors including i the desire by businesses to establish an online presence  ii significant registration activity by domain name speculators  who register names with the intention of reselling them  and iii extremely strong growth in new business start ups in the internet sector 
in late  the domain name registration market s growth rate began to decrease 
the overall number of domain names in the verisign registry decreased from a high of approximately million as of september  to approximately million as of december  we believe this was due  in large part  to the large number of names registered in and by domain name speculators that were not renewed 
the decline in the overall market  together with increased competition  contributed to a sequential quarterly decline in the number of our paid domain name registrations  transfers and renewals from the first quarter of until the introduction of new gtlds in the fourth quarter of and again from the first quarter of through the fourth quarter of as a result of all of these factors  which were slightly offset by the acquisition of virtual internet in march  we experienced a decrease in our total names under management from approximately million as of september  to approximately million as of december  other products and services  which primarily consist of email  domain name forwarding  web hosting  site submission to search engines  applications for new gtlds  intellectual property protection services related to the introduction of new gtlds and software  are sold either as one time offerings or annual or monthly subscriptions  depending on the product or service offering 
revenues from domain name applications  which may or may not result in domain registrations  and other intellectual property protection services related to the introduction of new gtlds are recognized upon the sale of the applications and related services 
revenues from our other products and services  such as email and domain name forwarding  are recognized ratably over the period in which we provide such services 

back to contents advertising revenues are derived from the sale of sponsorships and banner advertisements  typically under short term contracts that range from one month to one year in duration 
we recognize these revenues ratably over the period in which the advertisements are displayed provided that no significant company obligation remains and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists of the costs associated with providing domain name registrations and other products and services 
cost of revenues for domain name registrations represents amortization on a straight line basis over the life of the registration term of registry fees  depreciation on the equipment used to process the domain name registrations  fees paid to the co location facilities maintaining our equipment  and fees paid to the financial institutions to process credit card payments on our behalf 
cost of revenues does not include penalties for excessive credit card chargebacks and refunds  as such penalties are classified as general and administrative expense 
we pay registry fees for gtlds ranging from per year for each 
biz and 
info domain name registration to per year for each 
com  
net and 
org domain name registration 
we pay registry fees ranging from to  per year for one to ten year country code domain name registrations 
the largest component of our cost of revenues is the registry fees  which  while paid in full at the time the domain name is registered  are recorded as a prepaid expense and amortized to cost of revenues ratably over the terms of the registrations 
cost of revenues for our other products and services consists of fees paid to third party service providers  depreciation on the equipment used to deliver the services  fees paid to the co location facilities maintaining our equipment and fees paid to the financial institutions to process credit card payments on our behalf 
the cost of revenues for other products and services is recognized ratably over the periods in which the services are provided 
we have no direct cost of revenues associated with our advertising revenue and we have no incremental cost of revenues associated with delivering advertisements since we use the same equipment to deliver the advertisements as we use for our domain name registration services 
therefore  the gross profit margin on advertising revenue is  and accordingly  any decrease in advertising revenue would represent a reduction of our gross profit of the same amount 
we incur operational costs including salaries and commissions for our advertising sales staff  which are classified as operating expenses 
operating expenses our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative including non cash compensation  and amortization and writeoffs of intangible assets 
prior to january  our operating expenses also included amortization of goodwill  effective january  we adopted sfas and ceased amortization of goodwill 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  marketing programs such as advertising  and commissions paid to our sales representatives 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  fees for outside consultants  software licensing fees and related costs associated with the development and integration of new products and services  the enhancement of existing products and services  and quality assurance 
general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash compensation  consist primarily of employee salaries and other personnel related expenses for executive  financial and administrative personnel  as well as professional services fees  insurance premiums  penalties for excessive credit card chargebacks and refunds  and provisions for uncollectible receivables 
facilities expenses are allocated across our different operating expense categories 
non cash compensation expense relates to grants of restricted stock  stock options and warrants to employees  directors  consultants and vendors with exercise prices below fair market value on the date of grant 
based on such grants through december   we expect to record approximately million in additional non cash compensation expense through as follows million in  million in and million thereafter 
non cash compensation expense will reduce our earnings or increase our losses  as applicable  in future periods 

back to contents we review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of goodwill using estimated undiscounted cash flows 
these cash flows include an estimated terminal value based on a hypothetical sale of an acquisition at the end of the related goodwill amortization period 
we also compare the total market value of our common stock with the book value of our stockholders equity 
based on the foregoing factors  if we conclude that an other than temporary impairment of goodwill has occurred  we record an impairment writedown 
income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates of our current tax obligations and temporary differences resulting from timing differences for reporting items for book and tax purposes  the most significant of which is deferred revenue 
we recognize deferred taxes by the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in addition  valuation allowances are established when appropriate to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
net income loss although we achieved profitability for the year  we were not profitable for or our profitability in was due  in part  to a gain of million from the sale of our investment in a private company  and to interest income 
our net loss for included a writedown of million of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of afternic  and the reversal of a million tax valuation allowance which increased income by that amount 
our net loss for included a goodwill impairment writedown of million 
although we have recently taken several initiatives to reduce our operating expenses  these expenses could still increase in future periods as we make efforts to improve our operational and financial systems 
in addition  losses at virtual internet and registrypro have contributed to a decline in our profitability  and we expect losses at virtual internet and registrypro to impact our profitability negatively in in addition  unless we lower our credit card refunds and reduce our level of credit card chargebacks  we may continue to incur significant penalties from credit card companies that impact our profitability see risk factors for additional information 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate profitably or sustain or increase our positive cash flow in the future 

back to contents results of operations years ended december  and net revenues total net revenues decreased to million for the year from million in domain name registrations 
recognition of revenues from domain name registrations decreased to million in from million in this decrease was due in part to lower average prices and a longer dollar weighted average subscription term for domain names registered in compared with  and in part to a writeoff related to credit card receivables in these reductions were offset in part by the inclusion of virtual internet in our results of operations after march   for which revenues of million were recognized in we may face continued pricing pressure 
at december   we had million of deferred revenue compared with million at december   representing an increase of million for the year the increase was due primarily to the acquisition of virtual internet on march   whose balance sheet included deferred revenue of million at the date of acquisition 
our deferred revenue balance is an indicator of revenue to be recognized in future periods 
other products and services 
revenues from other products and services decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due primarily to the nonrecurrence in of million of revenues received during from sales of intellectual property services in connection with the launch of new gtlds  offset in part by increased sales in of email and websitenow services 
advertising 
revenues from advertising decreased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of softness in the internet advertising market 
we anticipate continued softness in the internet advertising market 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues increased to million in from million in cost of domain name registrations 
costs recognized for domain name registrations increased to million in from million in the increase was due to the inclusion of virtual internet in our results of operations after march   for which costs of million were recognized in  more than offsetting the decreased cost of domain name registrations that resulted from the lower registration revenues recognized in 
back to contents cost of other products and services 
cost of other products and services declined to million in from million  primarily because included million of costs related to sales of intellectual property services in connection with the launch of new gtlds  which did not recur in gross profit margin our gross profit margin declined to in from in  in part due to lower advertising revenues  in part to lower average prices  in part to fixed costs for depreciation and data center operations which comprised a higher percentage of the lower level of revenues 
operating expenses total operating expenses decreased to million in from million in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower expenses related to media advertising  direct mail and other promotional activities  offset in part by the inclusion of virtual internet in our results of operations after march  research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase resulted primarily from higher salaries and consulting fees for personnel working to improve our systems and operations  and in part from increased costs for software licenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the higher expense level was due to i an increase of million in credit card penalties as a result of excessive chargebacks and refunds  of which million was paid and million was accrued to cover our estimate of potential penalties which could be imposed for under one card association s rules  ii the inclusion of million of expenses for virtual internet which was acquired march   iii an increase of million in bad debt expense  iv the costs of operating our customer service center in canada which commenced operations in the third quarter of  and v startup costs of million for registrypro

amortization and writedown of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization and writedown of goodwill and other intangibles was million in compared with million in during the company recorded a goodwill impairment writedown of million related to afternic  which was acquired in september in september  the company made a decision to abandon the afternic business 
as a consequence of that decision  as well as negative industry and economic trends affecting the company and the general decline in technology company valuations  including the valuation of the company s common stock  the company performed an impairment analysis of the goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with its various acquisitions 
because the total market value of the company s common stock at september  was lower than the book value of its stockholders equity  the company recorded a goodwill impairment loss of million in september also in accordance with sfas  the company ceased amortization of goodwill effective january  
back to contents other income  net other income  net  which consisted primarily of interest income  net of interest expense  decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower prevailing interest rates in provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes in was a benefit of million  representing an effective tax rate of of the pre tax loss 
that effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of in part because only a portion of the goodwill impairment writedown is tax deductible  in part because no tax benefits were recorded in connection with losses generated by virtual internet in the united kingdom as realization is not assured  and in part because a substantial portion of our interest income is exempt from taxes 
in  the provision for income taxes was an expense of million  rather than a benefit  because goodwill amortization and the impairment writedown recorded in were not tax deductible 
years ended december  and net revenues total net revenues increased to million in from million in domain name registrations

sfas is applicable to exit or disposal activities initiated after december sfas accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fas was issued in december  and provides for alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair market value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through cash generated from operations  sales of equity securities and borrowings 
we issued  shares of our common stock to the public on march   which generated approximately million in proceeds after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities totaled million  representing an increase of million for the year at december   million of our cash was pledged to support letters of credit  and million was pledged to support a bank guarantee of a like amount of notes payable in connection with our acquisition of virtual internet 
we generated million of cash from operations in  compared with million in in we used million for capital expenditures  we received million from the exercise of options and warrants  and we used million to repurchase  shares of our common stock 

back to contents we issued notes payable in connection with our acquisition of virtual internet in march as of december  the dollar value of those notes was million 
the notes are repayable at the option of the holders at any time until june   at which time they mature 
although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures or other long term obligations  other than lease obligations for office space  we anticipate that we will increase our capital expenditures in connection with several ongoing and planned projects to enhance our systems 
additional capital expenditures could arise in connection with the potential addition of new products and services or additional co location facilities 
we currently anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to represent a material use of our cash resources 
we believe that our existing cash and anticipated cash to be provided from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
under an agreement with icann  registrypro  our wholly owned subsidiary  is obligated to launch the 
pro top level domain 
we have committed to provide up to million in funding and other non cash contributions to registrypro for registrypro s activities in establishing  operating and marketing the 
pro top level domain through the first anniversary of its commencement of service date 
however  we do not believe that registrypro s agreement with icann requires registrypro to spend a specified amount to establish  operate and market the 
pro top level domain 
accordingly  our contributions for these purposes could be less than million 
through december  we had contributed approximately million in cash  and had also made non cash contributions 
we incurred million of startup costs for registrypro in  and we anticipate additional net losses from registrypro in a summary of our contractual cash obligations for operating leases as of december  is as follows year ending december  in thousands thereafter  total contractual cash obligations  the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock through october  and we have purchased  shares for a total of million through december  purchases under the stock repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market  through block trades or otherwise 
depending on market conditions and other factors  such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
we have hired advisors in connection with the unsolicited acquisition proposals we received in january although the fees payable to the advisors and the related expenses are not yet determinable  we expect that such fees and expenses will be significant 
in addition  in connection with our restructuring program we have been reviewing our operations  including the ongoing capital requirements of our business 
while we are unable to predict the outcome of this review  the utilization of a significant portion of our cash and marketable securities is a possible result 

back to contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is primarily related to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we believe that we are not subject to a material interest rate risk because substantially all of our investments are in fixed rate  short term securities having a maturity of not more than two years  with a majority having a maturity of less than one year 
accordingly  the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
from time to time we also invest in publicly traded stocks  and we are subject to market price risk with respect to such investments 
at december  the fair value of our investments in publicly traded stocks was million 
we did not have any foreign currency hedging or derivative instruments at december  we generally do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not currently utilize derivative financial instruments 
while we have no present intention of utilizing derivative financial instruments in the future  it is possible that we may enter into such transactions or similar transactions 
at december  we had no long term debt 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
we derived of our net revenues for the year from operations outside of the united states 
we face foreign currency risks primarily as a result of the revenues that we receive from services delivered through our foreign subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  primarily with respect to the euro and the canadian dollar  as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  such financial results  when translated into us dollars  may vary from expectations and may adversely impact our operating results and our net income loss
