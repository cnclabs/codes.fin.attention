item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial and operating data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
overview waste connections  inc is an integrated solid waste services company that provides solid waste collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services in mostly secondary markets in the western  midwestern and southeastern us as of december   we served more than one million commercial  industrial and residential customers in alabama  california  colorado  georgia  illinois  iowa  kansas  kentucky  new mexico  minnesota  mississippi  montana  nebraska  ohio  oklahoma  oregon  south dakota  tennessee  texas  utah  washington  and wyoming 
as of that date  we owned collection operations and operated or owned transfer stations  subtitle d landfills  one construction and demolition landfill and recycling facilities 
we also own one subtitle d landfill site which is permitted for operation  but not constructed as of december  we generally intend to pursue an acquisition based growth strategy and as of december  have acquired businesses since our inception in september excluding debt and other long term liabilities assumed totaling million  the aggregate consideration for acquisitions occurring in  using the purchase method of accounting  was approximately million 
from inception through december   the results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included in our financial statements only from the respective dates of acquisition  except for acquisitions accounted for under the poolings of interests method of accounting  which are included for all periods presented 
we anticipate that a substantial part of our future growth will come from acquiring additional solid waste collection  transfer and disposal businesses and  therefore  we expect additional acquisitions could continue to affect period to period comparisons of our operating results 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
self insurance liabilities 
during  we increased our scope of self insurance  becoming primarily self insured for automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation claims 
previously  we were primarily self insured only for automobile collision and employee group health claims 
our self insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported and are developed by our management and by our third party claims administrator 
the self insurance accruals are influenced by our past claims experience factors  which have a limited history  and by published industry development factors 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
the frequency and amount of claims or incidents could vary significantly over a period of time  which could materially affect our self insurance liabilities 
additionally  the actual costs to settle the self insurance liabilities could materially differ from the original estimates 
accounting for landfills 
the discussion below details our accounting policies for landfills through december  as of january   our practice will change upon our adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

our adoption of sfas no 
will result in a significant change to our accounting policies for landfill closure and post closure obligations 
see discussion below under new accounting pronouncements for additional information and an analysis of the estimated impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our balance sheet and results of operations for the year ended december  we amortize certain costs at our landfills using a units of production method as permitted airspace of the landfill is consumed 
landfill closure and post closure costs are recorded at net present value and accreted to reflect the passage of time 
the accounting methods discussed below require us to make certain estimates and assumptions 
changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
any changes to our estimates are applied prospectively 
landfill development costs 
landfill development costs include the costs of acquisition  construction associated with excavation  liners  site berms  groundwater monitoring wells and leachate collection systems 
we estimate the total costs associated with developing each landfill site to its final capacity 
total landfill costs include the development costs associated with deemed permitted airspace 
deemed permitted airspace is addressed below 
landfill development costs are dependent upon future events and thus actual costs could vary significantly from our estimates 
material differences between estimated and actual development costs may affect our cash flows by increasing our capital expenditures and thus affect our results of operations by increasing our landfill depletion expense 
closure and post closure obligations 
we reserve for estimated closure and post closure maintenance obligations at the landfills we own and certain landfills that we operate  but do not own 
we could have additional material financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs of the other disposal facilities that we currently own or operate and that we may own or operate in the future 
we calculate the net present value of the closure and post closure commitment assuming an inflation rate of and a discount rate of 
we accrete discounted amounts previously recorded to reflect the passage of time 
our adoption of sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
on january  will result in a significant change to our accounting policies for landfill closure and post closure obligations 
for example  our discount rate will be increased to as of january  refer to new accounting pronouncements below for an analysis of the estimated impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our balance sheet and results of operations for the year ended december  significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
disposal capacity 
our internal and third party engineers perform surveys at least annually to estimate the disposal capacity at our landfills 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the remaining disposal capacity  considering both permitted and deemed permitted airspace  at our landfills 
deemed permitted airspace consists of additional disposal capacity being pursued through means of an expansion 
deemed permitted airspace that meets certain internal criteria is included in our estimate of total landfill airspace 
our internal criteria to determine when deemed permitted airspace may be included as disposal capacity is as follows the land where the expansion is being sought is contiguous to the current disposal site  and is either owned by us or we have a purchase option  total development costs and closure post closure costs have been determined  internal personnel have performed a financial analysis of the proposed expansion site and have determined that it has a positive financial and operational impact  internal or external personnel are actively working to obtain the necessary approvals to obtain the landfill expansion permit  obtaining the expansion is considered probable 
for a pursued expansion to be considered probable  there must be no significant known technical  legal  community  business  or political restrictions or similar issues existing that could impair the success of the expansion  and the land where the expansion is being sought has the proper zoning 
we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for disposal capacity that has been deemed permitted 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for deemed permitted disposal capacity  we will charge the previously capitalized development costs to expense 
this will adversely affect our operating results and cash flows and could result in greater landfill depletion expense being recognized on a prospective basis 
we periodically evaluate our landfill sites for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions  anticipated cash flows and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangibles associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could reduce our net worth and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  our credit agreement contains a covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum funded debt to capitalization ratio  and net worth is one of the components of capitalization 
a reduction in net worth  therefore  if substantial  could limit the amount that we can borrow under our credit agreement and any failure to comply with the agreement could result in an event of default under the credit agreement 
as of december   goodwill and intangible assets represented of our total assets 
allocation of acquisition purchase price 
we allocate acquisition purchase prices to identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to goodwill 
we deem the total remaining permitted and deemed permitted airspace of an acquired landfill to be a tangible asset 
therefore  for acquired landfills  we initially allocate the purchase price to identified intangible and tangible assets acquired  excluding landfill airspace  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
any residual amount is allocated to landfill airspace 
we often consummate single acquisitions that include a combination of collection operations and landfills 
for each separately identified collection operation and landfill acquired in a single acquisition  we perform an initial allocation of total purchase price to the identified collection operations and landfills based on their relative fair values 
following this initial allocation of total purchase price to the identified collection operations and landfills  we further allocate the identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each collection operation and landfill based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to either goodwill or landfill site costs  as discussed above 
we accrue the payment of contingent purchase price if the events surrounding the contingency are deemed probable 
contingent purchase price related to landfills is allocated to landfill site costs and contingent purchase price for acquisitions other than landfills is allocated to goodwill 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorated  impairing their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  if certain customer and billing information is not properly integrated from acquisitions that we close  additional allowances may be required 
general our revenues consist mainly of fees we charge customers for solid waste collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services 
our collection business also generates revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities  which have significant variability 
a large part of our collection revenues comes from providing commercial  industrial and residential services 
we frequently perform these services under service agreements or franchise agreements with counties or municipal contracts 
our existing franchise agreements and all of our existing municipal contracts give us the exclusive right to provide specified waste services in the specified territory during the contract term 
these exclusive arrangements are awarded  at least initially  on a competitive bid basis and subsequently on a bid or negotiated basis 
we also provide residential collection services on a subscription basis with individual households 
approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  were derived from market areas where services are provided predominantly under exclusive franchise agreements  long term municipal contracts and governmental certificates 
governmental certificates grant us perpetual and exclusive collection rights in the covered areas 
contracts with counties and municipalities and governmental certificates provide relatively consistent cash flow during the terms of the contracts 
because we bill most residential customers quarterly  subscription agreements also provide a stable source of revenues for us 
our collection business also generates revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities 
the table below shows for the periods indicated the percentage of our total reported revenues attributable to services provided  prior to intercompany eliminations 
year ended december  collection landfill transfer and processing recycling other we charge transfer station and landfill customers a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at the transfer stations and the landfill facilities we own and operate 
many of our transfer and landfill customers have entered into one to ten year disposal contracts with us  most of which provide for annual indexed price increases 
we typically determine the prices for our solid waste services by the collection frequency and level of service  route density  volume  weight and type of waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing  and prices charged by competitors for similar services 
the terms of our contracts sometimes limit our ability to pass on price increases 
long term solid waste collection contracts often contain a formula  generally based on a published price index that automatically adjusts fees to cover increases in some  but not all  operating costs 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from services provided under exclusive municipal contracts and franchise agreements 
no single contract or customer accounted for more than of our revenues for the years ended december   and costs of operations include labor  fuel  equipment maintenance and tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  worker s compensation and vehicle insurance and claims expense  the cost of materials we purchase for recycling  third party transportation expense  district and state taxes and host community fees and royalties 
in  we increased our scope of self insurance  becoming primarily self insured for general liability  workers compensation and automobile liability 
previously  we were primarily self insured only for automobile collision and employee group health claims 
the frequency and amount of claims or incidents for the areas in which we are primarily self insured could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and or year to year  resulting in increased volatility of our cost of operations 
as of december   we owned and or operated transfer stations  which reduce our costs by allowing us to use collection personnel and equipment more efficiently and by consolidating waste to reduce transportation costs to remote sites and gain more favorable disposal rates that may be available for larger quantities of waste 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation  overhead costs associated with our marketing and sales force  professional services and community relations expense 
depreciation expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
prior to january   amortization expense included the amortization of goodwill for businesses acquired prior to june  and other intangible assets using the straight line method 
as discussed more fully below  beginning january   goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized 
we capitalize some third party expenditures related to pending acquisitions or development projects  such as legal  engineering and interest expenses 
we expense indirect acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  as we incur them 
we charge against net income any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion that we believe we may recover  through sale or otherwise that relate to any operation that is permanently shut down and any pending acquisition or landfill development project that we believe will not be completed 
we routinely evaluate all capitalized costs  and expense those related to projects that we believe are not likely to succeed 
at december   we had million of capitalized interest related to landfill development projects and million in capitalized expenditures relating to pending acquisitions 
we continually evaluate the value and future benefits of our intangible assets  including goodwill 
we assess the recoverability from future operations using cash flows and income from operations of the related acquired businesses as measures 
under this approach  the carrying value is reduced if it becomes probable that our best estimate for expected future cash flows of the related business would be less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets 
as of december   there have been no adjustments to the carrying amounts of intangibles resulting from these evaluations 
as of december   goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately of total assets and of stockholders equity 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired entities 
in allocating the purchase price of an acquired company among its assets  we first assign value to the tangible assets  followed by intangible assets  including covenants not to compete and certain contracts 
we determine the value of the other intangible assets by considering  among other things  the present value of the cash flows associated with those assets 
new accounting pronouncements sfas nos 
and in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets collectively  the statements  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets  including those meeting new recognition criteria under the statements  continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we fully adopted the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning on january  we test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
in  we performed the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets based on the carrying values as of january  and september  between september  and december   no events or changes in circumstances occurred that indicated the potential existence of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairment 
as a result of performing the tests for potential impairment  we determined that no impairment existed as of january  or december  and therefore  it was not necessary to write down any of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets 
we will continue to perform the potential impairment tests on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
net income for the years ended december  and  adjusted for the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 
 was million and million  respectively 
basic shares outstanding were  and  respectively  for the years ended december  and diluted shares outstanding were  and  respectively  for the years ended december  and sfas no 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 which outlines standards for accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
sfas no 
is effective beginning january  and will impact the accounting for landfill retirement obligations  which we have historically referred to as closure and post closure obligations 
the adoption of sfas no 
will have no impact on our cash requirements 
accrued closure and post closure costs represent an estimate of the current value of the future obligation associated with closure and post closure monitoring of non hazardous solid waste landfills we currently own and or operate 
closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance costs represent the costs related to cash expenditures yet to be incurred when a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes 
accruals for closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance requirements in the us consider site inspection  groundwater monitoring  leachate management  methane gas control and recovery  and operating and maintenance costs to be incurred during the period after the facility closes 
certain of these environmental costs  principally capping and methane gas control costs  are also incurred during the operating life of the site in accordance with the landfill operation requirements of subtitle d and the air emissions standards 
site specific closure and post closure engineering cost estimates are prepared annually for landfills owned and or operated by us for which we are responsible for closure and post closure 
under our historical accounting practice  landfill closure and post closure obligations are calculated by estimating the total obligation in current dollars  inflating the obligation based upon the expected date of the expenditure using an inflation rate of and discounting the inflated total to its present value using a discount rate 
the resulting obligation is recorded as a long term liability with a corresponding increase to landfill site costs 
interest is accreted on the recorded liability using the corresponding discount rate and recorded as a component of interest expense 
the amount recorded to site costs is charged to depletion expense on a units of consumption basis as landfill airspace is consumed 
the impact of changes determined to be changes in estimates  based on the annual update  are accounted for on a prospective basis 
final capping costs are generally included in the estimate of the total costs associated with developing each landfill site to its final capacity and depleted on a units of production basis under our current accounting method as landfill airspace is consumed 
final capping costs have generally not been included in the calculation of closure and post closure liabilities under our current accounting method 
we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will impact the calculation of landfill retirement obligations  and the classification of amounts recorded in the financial statements as follows landfill closure and post closure liabilities will continue to be calculated by estimating the total obligation in current dollars  inflating the obligation based upon the expected date of the expenditure using an inflation rate of and discounting the inflated total to its present value using an discount rate 
the discount rate is higher than the historically used because sfas no 
requires the use of a credit adjusted risk free rate 
the resulting closure and post closure obligation will be recorded on the balance sheet as the landfill s total airspace is consumed 
discounting the obligation with a higher discount rate and recording the liability as airspace is consumed results in a decrease to the previously recorded closure and post closure liabilities 
final capping costs will be included in the calculation of closure and post closure liabilities 
final capping costs will be estimated using current dollars  inflated to the expected date of the final capping expenditures  discounted to a net present value and recorded on the balance sheet as a component of closure and post closure liabilities as landfill airspace is consumed 
interest accretion will be reduced as a result of the decrease in the recorded closure and post closure liabilities and will be reclassified from interest expense to cost of operations  thus causing a reduction in income from operations and an increase of net income 
however  there will be no change in operating cash flow 
depletion on the closure and post closure obligation recorded as a component of landfill site costs will generally be less during the early portion of a landfill s operating life and increase thereafter 
upon adoption  sfas no 
requires a cumulative change in accounting for landfill obligations retroactively to the date of the inception of the landfill 
inception of the asset retirement obligation is the date operations commenced or the date the asset was acquired 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we expect a cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of million million  net of tax  a decrease in our closure and post closure liability of million and a decrease in our net landfill assets of million 
the following is a summary of management s estimate of the changes that will result from the adoption of sfas no

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures 
sfas no 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 modifications to reporting of extinguishments of debt and accounting for certain capital lease modifications and technical corrections  effective for transactions occurring after may  sfas no 
requires gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items 
sfas no 
also requires that certain modifications to capital leases be treated as a sale leaseback and modifies the accounting for sub leases when the original lessee remains a secondary obligor or guarantor 
we elected to adopt sfas no 
early  which resulted in the reclassification from extraordinary items to other expenses of million of losses incurred during the year ended december  resulting from early extinguishments of debt 
sfas no 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  effective for transactions occurring after december  sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
our adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
sfas no 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas no

sfas no 
also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no

 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
sfas no 
does not amend sfas no 
to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no

fin in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
it clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee  including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the objective of the initial measurement of the liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are effective for us on a prospective basis for guarantees issued after december  we will record the fair value of future material guarantees  if any 
fin in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin 
fin requires that unconsolidated variable interest entities be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries 
a primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses or residual benefits 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to existing variable interest entities beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial statements because  as of december   we consolidate all of our less than owned subsidiaries

for the remaining increase in revenues  million was attributable to selected price increases  million was due to improved recyclable commodity prices and million was the result of volume growth in our existing business 
cost of operations 
total cost of operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to acquisitions closed in  the inclusion in of months of operating costs from businesses acquired in  million of costs incurred resulting from an employee labor strike at our facilities in pierce county  washington  growth in our existing business and higher insurance costs  partially offset by greater integration of collection volumes into landfills we own or operate 
total cost of operations as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  increased percentage points to from for the year ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to the mix of revenues associated with acquisitions closed in  which had operating margins below our company average  higher insurance costs  and costs resulting from a labor strike in pierce county  washington  partially offset by greater integration of collection volumes into landfills we own or operate 
sg a 
total sg a increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to additional personnel from acquisitions closed in  the inclusion in of months of sg a costs from businesses acquired in  additional corporate  regional and district level overhead  million of employment related expenses associated with the termination of our search for a chief operating officer and the hiring of two new corporate officers  higher relocation expenses associated with new hires and transfers of existing employees  increased bad debt expense  increased legal expenses  higher insurance costs  stock compensation expense related to the issuance of restricted stock to district level personnel in  million expense associated with the relocation of our headquarters and early termination of our former corporate headquarters property lease and million of costs associated with the listing of our common stock on the new york stock exchange

sg a as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  increased percentage point to from for the year ended december  the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues resulted from acquisitions closed in having sg a costs as a percentage of revenues above our company average  additional corporate  regional and district level overhead to accommodate our current and future growth  employment related expenses associated with the termination of our search for a chief operating officer and the hiring of two new corporate officers  higher employee relocation expenses related to new hires and transfers of existing employees  increased bad debt expense  increased legal expenses  stock compensation expense related to restricted stock issued to district level personnel in  the accrual of an expense associated with the relocation of our headquarters and early termination of our former corporate headquarters property lease and costs associated with the listing of our common stock on the new york stock exchange 
the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues was partially offset by the recognition during of expenses related to the termination of negotiations and due diligence for a large potential acquisition 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from increased depletion due to higher volumes of waste disposed at our landfills  depreciation and depletion associated with acquisitions closed in and the inclusion in of months of depreciation and depletion from businesses acquired in  and increased depreciation expense resulting from new equipment acquired to support our base operations  partially offset by decreased amortization expense from not amortizing goodwill during the year ended december   due to the application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 
total goodwill amortization expense recognized in the year ended december  was million 
no goodwill amortization expense was recognized in the year ended december  depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  decreased percentage points to from for the year ended december  the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues was the result of applying the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 
 partially offset by increased depletion due to higher volumes of waste disposed at our landfills and increased depreciation expense associated with new equipment acquired in goodwill amortization expense as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  was 
loss on disposal of operations 
during the year ended december   we sold some of our utah operations that were deemed to no longer be of strategic importance 
we recognized a non cash pre tax loss of million from this sale 
operating income 
operating income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the growth in revenues  applying the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 
and the absence of the prior year loss associated with the disposal of some of our utah operations  partially offset by higher operating costs  depreciation  depletion and sg a expenses 
operating income as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  increased percentage points to from for the year ended december  the increase in operating income as a percentage of revenues was attributable to applying the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 
and not incurring losses on the disposal of operations  partially offset by declines in gross margins  higher depreciation and depletion expenses and an increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to higher debt levels incurred to fund our acquisitions  partially offset by lower interest rates on our revolving credit facility and our replacing a portion of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility with lower interest subordinated debt obligations 
at december   we had million of floating rate borrowings under our credit facility  million of floating rate convertible subordinated notes due and million of other floating rate debt 
should interest rates rise  our interest cost on these borrowings would increase 
based on the outstanding borrowing amounts for these floating rate instruments at december   a one percent increase in interest rates would result in a million increase in interest expense 
other expense 
other expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the primary component of other expense for the year ended december  was million of expenses resulting from cash payments for the early termination of an interest rate swap 
during the first quarter of  we determined that the debt  the specific cash flows of which an interest rate swap was designated as hedging  would be repaid prior to its due date from the net proceeds of our convertible subordinated debt offering  therefore  it was probable that the future variable interest payments under the related debt the hedged transactions would not occur 
the remaining components of other expense for and were net losses incurred on the disposal of certain assets 
minority interests 
minority interests increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to increased earnings by our majority owned subsidiaries  as well as our owning majority interests in those entities  acquired in february  for the entire months ended december   compared to owning them for approximately eleven months in the year ended december  provision for income taxes 
income taxes increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to increased pre tax earnings  partially offset by a percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate due to the elimination of non deductible goodwill 
the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was  which is above the federal statutory rate of primarily due to state and local taxes 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased operating income in  and the absence of prior year losses associated with the disposal of some of our utah operations and the termination of an interest rate swap in  partially offset by increases in interest expense  higher income tax expense and higher minority interests 
years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues for increased million  or  to million from million in approximately of the increase resulted from acquisitions accounted for using the purchase method of accounting that closed since the beginning of the remaining increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion in of months of revenues from businesses acquired in  selective price increases and growth in the base business  partially offset by a decline in commodity prices and the loss of revenues previously generated by certain utah operations that were sold in cost of operations 
total cost of operations for increased million  or  to million from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the cost of operations of acquisitions closed since the beginning of the year and the inclusion in of months of operating costs from businesses acquired in cost of operations as a percentage of revenues declined by percentage points to in from in the decline in cost of operations as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to the effect of tuck in acquisitions closed since the beginning of  economies of scale from the larger revenue base  greater integration of collection volumes into landfills we own or operate and selective price increases 
sg a 
sg a expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for our sg a increased as a result of additional personnel from companies acquired  additional corporate overhead to accommodate our growth and the incurrence of million in expenses related to the termination of negotiations and due diligence for a large potential acquisition 
sg a as a percentage of revenues increased percentage points to for from for the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues was due to the incurrence of terminated acquisition expenses  offset by the result of spreading overhead expenses over a larger base of revenue from the acquisitions completed in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or to million in from million in the increase resulted primarily from the inclusion of depreciation and amortization of businesses acquired in  the inclusion in of months of depreciation and amortization from businesses acquired in  the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with acquisitions accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and a greater percentage of revenues derived from landfill activity 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues increased percentage points to for from for the increase in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues in was due to the increased amortization of landfill airspace associated with landfills purchased in and the roll over effect of landfills acquired in  partially offset by not having to amortize goodwill on acquisitions closed subsequent to june  the landfill amortization rates as a percentage of revenues are generally higher than the depreciation and amortization rates associated with collection assets 
loss on disposal of operations 
during  we sold some of our utah operations that were deemed to no longer be of strategic importance 
we recognized a pre tax loss of million from this sale 
during  we sold our idaho operations and recognized a pre tax loss of million from this sale

acquisition related expenses decreased to for from million in the prior year acquisition related expenses were for commissions  professional fees  and other direct costs resulting from the one acquisition that was accounted for using the pooling of interests method 
operating income 
operating income increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was attributable to operating income recognized from acquisitions closed in  the inclusion in of months of operating income from acquisitions closed in  selective price increases  economies of scale from a greater revenue base and greater integration of collection volumes into transfer stations and landfills we own or operate  partially offset by increased losses from the disposal of certain operations  increased depreciation and amortization expenses and sg a expenses 
operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased percentage points to for from for the decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues is attributable to the increased losses on the disposal of certain operations  and increases in depreciation and amortization and sg a as a percentage of revenues  partially offset by the improvement in gross margins and economies of scale from a greater revenue base  and the elimination of stock compensation and acquisition related expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for from million in the increase is attributable to higher debt levels to fund certain of our acquisitions  partially offset by lower interest rates on our revolving credit facility and our payment of a portion of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility with funds received from our issuance of convertible subordinated debt obligations bearing lower interest rates 
other expense 
other expense increased million to million in from other income of million in the primary components of other expense in was million of expenses resulting from cash payments made to terminate an interest rate swap prior to its due date  partially offset by gains on the sale of certain assets 
during the first quarter of  we determined that the debt  the specific cash flows of which an interest rate swap was designated as hedging  would be repaid prior to its due date from the net proceeds of our convertible subordinated debt offering  therefore  it was probable that the future variable interest payments under the related debt the hedged transactions would not occur 
minority interests 
minority interests were million in  compared to in the increase is attributable to the purchase by waste connections during the first quarter of of majority interests in two unrelated entities

liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive 
our capital requirements include acquisitions and fixed asset purchases 
we expect that we will also make capital expenditures for landfill cell construction  landfill development and landfill closure activities in the future 
we plan to meet our capital needs through various financing sources  including internally generated funds  debt and equity financings 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million  including cash and equivalents of million 
our working capital deficit increased million from million at december  our strategy in managing our working capital is generally to apply the cash generated from our operations that remains after satisfying our working capital and capital expenditure requirements to reduce our indebtedness under our credit facility and to minimize our cash balances 
the increase in our working capital deficit from the prior year is primarily due to increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  combined with our strategy of minimizing our cash balances 
in april  we sold million of convertible subordinated notes due april the notes in a rule a private placement 
the notes are unsecured  rank junior to existing and future senior indebtedness  as defined in the indenture governing the notes  and are convertible at any time at the option of the holder into common stock at a conversion price of per share 
we received proceeds of approximately million from our private placement of these notes and used these proceeds to repay certain outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
during april  we sold million of floating rate convertible subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes bear interest at the month libor rate plus basis points  payable quarterly 
the notes are unsecured and rank pari passu with the notes and junior to all existing and future senior indebtedness  as defined in the indenture governing the notes 
upon the incurrence of certain conditions  the notes are convertible into common stock at shares per  principal amount of notes  or per share 
no change in the available borrowing capacity under our credit facility or material covenants resulted from our issuance of the notes 
we received proceeds of approximately million from our sale of the notes and used the proceeds to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness and related costs under our credit facility and for general corporate purposes  including payment for an acquisition 
we have a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for which fleet boston financial corp 
acts as agent 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million outstanding under the credit facility  exclusive of stand by letters of credit  with the interest on million of the outstanding borrowings at prime plus basis points and the interest on million of the outstanding borrowings at libor plus basis points 
the credit facility allows us to issue up to million in stand by letters of credit  which reduce the amount of total borrowings available under the credit facility 
as of december   we had million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit facility 
thus  at december  we had approximately million in borrowing capacity available under our credit facility 
virtually all of our assets  including our interest in the equity securities of our subsidiaries  secure our obligations under the credit facility 
the credit facility matures in and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our discretion  either the fleet national bank base rate plus applicable margin  or the eurodollar rate plus applicable margin 
the credit facility places certain business  financial and operating restrictions on the company relating to  among other things  incurring additional indebtedness  investments  acquisitions  asset sales  mergers  dividends  distributions  and repurchases and redemption of capital stock 
the credit facility also contains covenants requiring that specified financial ratios and balances be maintained 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the credit facility also requires the lenders approval of acquisitions in certain circumstances 
we use the credit facility for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital  standby letters of credit and general corporate purposes 
at december   we had an aggregate of million outstanding under the credit facility 
the million decrease in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility was primarily due to paying a portion of our credit facility balance with the proceeds from our notes  the proceeds from stock option exercises and cash generated from operations  partially offset by borrowings under our credit facility to fund our acquisitions and capital expenditures 
if we are unable to incur additional indebtedness under our credit facility or obtain additional capital through future debt or equity financings  our rate of growth through acquisitions may decline 
as of december   we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments in thousands payments due by period contractual less than to to over obligations total year years years years long term debt      operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations      long term debt payments include million due under our credit facility 
as of december   our credit facility allows us to borrow up to million 
amount of commitment expiration per period commercial less than to to over commitments total year years years years standby letters of credit   financial surety bonds    total commercial commitments    we use financial surety bonds for a variety of corporate guarantees 
the two largest uses of financial surety bonds are for municipal contract performance guarantees and landfill closure and post closure financial assurance required under certain environmental regulations 
as a result of recent changes in the insurance industry  we have experienced less availability and increased costs of surety bonds for landfill closure and post closure requirements 
we generally have not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining surety bonds for performance under our municipal collection contracts or landfill operating agreements 
environmental regulations require demonstrated financial assurance to meet closure and post closure requirements for landfills 
in addition to surety bonds  these requirements may also be met through alternative financial assurance instruments  including insurance  letters of credit and restricted cash deposits 
our current surety bond underwriters have provided us with non binding commitments to issue up to million of bonds  consisting of million of bonds for landfill closure and post closure requirements and million of bonds for performance under collection contracts and landfill operating agreements 
these non binding commitments do not have a stated expiration date  however  individual bonds issued typically have a term of one year 
at december   we had provided customers and various regulatory authorities with surety bonds in the aggregate amount of approximately million to secure our landfill closure and post closure requirements and million to secure performance under collection contracts and landfill operating agreements 
if our current bond underwriters are unwilling to issue additional bonds under the current non binding commitment  renew existing bonds upon expiration  or increase their total commitment upon reaching the maximum issuance amount under the current non binding commitments  or if we are unable to obtain surety bonds through new underwriters as such needs arise  we would need to arrange other means of financial assurance  such as a cash trust or a letter of credit  to secure contract performance or meet closure and post closure requirements 
while such alternate financial assurance has been readily available  it may result in additional expense or capital outlays 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operations was approximately million 
of this  million was provided by working capital for the period 
the primary components of working capital were increases in accrued liabilities associated with income taxes  interest  payroll and insurance  partially offset by an increase in trade accounts receivable and a decline in accounts payable 
the remaining components of the net cash provided by operations for include million of net income  million of depreciation and amortization  million of minority interest expense  a combined million of non cash debt issuance cost amortization and stock compensation expense and million of deferred income taxes 
for the year ended december   net cash used by investing activities was million 
of this  million was used to fund the cash portion of acquisitions closed in cash used for capital expenditures was million  which was primarily for investments in fixed assets  consisting primarily of trucks  containers  other equipment and landfill development 
other cash inflows from investing activities include million received from the disposal of assets 
other cash outflows from investing activities include million of restricted cash funding in for our landfill closure and post closure obligations 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million  which was provided by million of net borrowings under our various debt arrangements and million of proceeds from stock option and warrant exercises  less million of cash distributions to minority interest holders and million of debt issuance costs  primarily related to our notes sold in we made approximately million in capital expenditures during the year ended december  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million in in connection with our existing business 
we intend to fund our planned capital expenditures principally through existing cash  internally generated funds  and borrowings under our existing credit facility 
in addition  we may make substantial additional capital expenditures in acquiring solid waste collection and disposal businesses 
if we acquire additional landfill disposal facilities  we may also have to make significant expenditures to bring them into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  obtain permits or expand our available disposal capacity 
we cannot currently determine the amount of these expenditures because they will depend on the number  nature  condition and permitted status of any acquired landfill disposal facilities 
we believe that our credit facility and the funds we expect to generate from operations will provide adequate cash to fund our working capital and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 
from time to time we evaluate our existing operations and their strategic importance to waste connections 
if we determine that a given operating unit does not have future strategic importance  we may sell or otherwise dispose of those operations 
although we believe our operations would not be impaired by such dispositions  we could incur losses on them 
inflation to date  inflation has not significantly affected our operations 
consistent with industry practice  many of our contracts allow us to pass through certain costs to our customers  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
therefore  we believe that we should be able to increase prices to offset many cost increases that result from inflation 
however  competitive pressures may require us to absorb at least part of these cost increases  particularly during periods of high inflation 
seasonality based on historic trends experienced by the businesses we have acquired  we expect our operating results to vary seasonally  with revenues typically lowest in the first quarter  higher in the second and third quarters and lower in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarters 
we expect the fluctuation in our revenues between our highest and lowest seasonally performing quarters to be in the range of approximately to 
this seasonality reflects the lower volume of solid waste generated during the late fall  winter and early spring months because of decreased construction and demolition activities during the winter months in the us in addition  some of our operating costs may be higher in the winter months 
adverse winter weather conditions slow waste collection activities  resulting in higher labor and operational costs 
greater precipitation in the winter increases the weight of collected waste  resulting in higher disposal costs  which are calculated on a per ton basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and certain commodity prices 
we use hedge agreements to manage a portion of our risks related to interest rates 
while we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to our hedge agreements  in all cases such counterparties are highly rated financial institutions and we do not anticipate non performance 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we monitor our hedge positions by regularly evaluating the positions at market and by performing sensitivity analyses 
in december  we entered into an interest rate swap with fleet boston financial corporation 
under the swap agreement  which was effective through december  the interest rate on a million libor based loan under the credit facility was effectively fixed with an interest rate of plus applicable margin 
this rate remained at if libor was less than 
if libor exceeded  the interest rate under the swap agreement would increase one basis point for every libor basis point above 
in may  we entered into another interest rate swap with union bank of california 
under the swap agreement  which was effective through december  the interest rate on a separate million libor based loan under the credit facility was effectively fixed with an interest rate of plus applicable margin 
in december  we restructured both of those interest rate swap agreements  extending their maturity through december and removing their embedded option features 
as of december   the fleet boston swap had a notional amount of million at a fixed rate of plus applicable margin and the union bank of california swap had a notional amount of million at a fixed rate of plus applicable margin 
in march  million of the notional amount under the union bank of california swap was terminated because we used the proceeds from our convertible subordinated notes offering to repay million of the libor loan  the cash flows of which this swap was designated as hedging 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive hedge positions and all other debt 
such an analysis is inherently limited in that it reflects a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect we would recognize from the assumed market rate movements 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to the million remaining floating rate balance owed under our credit facility  million of our notes  million of floating rate debt under various notes payable to third parties and floating rate municipal bond obligations of approximately million 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt as of december  would decrease our annual pre tax income by approximately million 
all of our remaining debt instruments are at fixed rates  or effectively fixed under the interest rate swap agreements described above  therefore  changes in market interest rates under these instruments would not significantly impact our cash flows or results of operations 
we market a variety of recyclable materials  including cardboard  office paper  plastic containers  glass bottles and ferrous and aluminum metals 
we own and operate recycling processing facilities and sell other collected recyclable materials to third parties for processing before resale 
we often share the profits from our resale of recycled materials with other parties to our recycling contracts 
for example  certain of our municipal recycling contracts in washington  negotiated before we acquired those businesses  specify benchmark resale prices for recycled commodities 
if the prices we actually receive for the processed recycled commodities collected under the contract exceed the prices specified in the contract  we share the excess with the municipality  after recovering any previous shortfalls resulting from actual market prices falling below the prices specified in the contract 
to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk with respect to recycled materials  we have adopted a pricing strategy of charging collection and processing fees for recycling volume collected from third parties 
although there can be no assurance of market recoveries in the event of a decline  because of the provisions within certain of our contracts that pass commodity risk along to the customers  we believe  given historical trends and fluctuations in the recycling commodities market  that a decrease in average recycled commodity prices from the prices that were in effect at december  would not materially affect our cash flows or pre tax income
