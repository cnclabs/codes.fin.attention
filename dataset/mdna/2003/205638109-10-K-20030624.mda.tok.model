item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this discussion contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws which are identified by the use of the words believes  expects  anticipates  will  contemplates  would and similar expressions that contemplate future events 
numerous important factors  risks and uncertainties affect our operating results  including  without limitation  those discussed below and contained elsewhere in this report 
these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from the results implied by these or any other forward looking statements made by us  or on our behalf 
there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations 
while we believe that our forward looking statements are reasonable  you should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
except as required by applicable law  we do not undertake any obligation to publicly release any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report 
our quarterly financial results vary and may be adversely affected by certain relatively fixed costs 
our product revenues vary from quarter to quarter 
net income may be disproportionately affected by a fluctuation in revenues because only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenues 
historical seasonality in license revenue cannot be relied on as an indicator of future performance due to the current economic conditions affecting the it industry 
our success depends in part on our ability to develop product enhancements and new products which keep pace with continuing changes in technology and customer preferences 
approximately to of our revenue is derived from foreign sources 
this exposes us to exchange rate risks on foreign currencies and to other international risks such as the need to comply with foreign and us export laws  and the uncertainty of certain foreign economies 
in  we filed a lawsuit against ibm alleging  among other things  copyright infringement  misappropriation of trade secrets  intentional interference with contractual relations and economic expectancy  false advertising and various violations of the lanham act  as well as various anti trust law violations 
we claim that ibm has misappropriated portions of our software tools  used our technology to develop competing products  used its monopoly power to engage in unlawful tying arrangements and subverted competition on the merits 
ibm has filed a counterclaim against us alleging violation of six of their patents 
pursuit of this litigation will be costly  time consuming and may divert management s time and attention 
our legal expenses have increased substantially and our general and administrative expenses could further increase as a result of these factors 
in addition  ibm may seek to influence our customers and potential customers to reduce or eliminate the amount of our products and services that they purchase  or our lawsuit against ibm may otherwise be viewed negatively by our customers and potential customers and cause them to refrain from buying our products and services 
any of the foregoing developments could adversely affect our position in the marketplace and our results of operations 
while we are expanding our focus on distributed software products  a majority of our revenue from software products is dependent on our customers continued use of ibm and ibm compatible mainframe products and on the acceptance of our pricing structure for software licenses and maintenance 
the pricing of our software licenses and maintenance is under constant pressure from customers and competitive vendors 
we regard our software as proprietary and attempt to protect it with copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure  copying and transferring title 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in addition to the ibm claims discussed above  there can be no assurance that other third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to current and future products or that any such assertion may not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
we depend on key employees and technical personnel 
the loss of certain key employees or our inability to attract and retain other qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operating margins may decline 
we do not compile margin analysis other than on a segment basis 
however  we are aware that operating expenses associated with our distributed systems products are higher than those associated with our traditional mainframe products 
since we believe the best opportunities for revenue growth are in the distributed systems market  products operating margins could experience more pressure 
in addition  operating margins in the professional services business are significantly impacted by small fluctuations in revenue since most costs are fixed during any short term period 
our results could be adversely affected by increased competition and pricing pressures 
we consider over firms to be directly competitive with one or more of our products 
these competitors include bmc software  inc  borland  computer associates international  inc  international business machines corporation ibm and mercury interactive corporation 
some of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  recruiting and training resources than we do 
the market for professional services is highly competitive  fragmented and characterized by low barriers to entry 
our principal competitors in professional services include accenture  computer sciences corporation  electronic data systems corporation  ibm global services  analysts international corporation  keane  inc and numerous other regional and local firms in the markets in which we have professional services offices 
several of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  recruiting and training resources than we do 
the slowdown in the world economy could continue for an extended period and could cause customers to further delay or forego decisions to license new products or upgrades to their existing environments or to reduce their requirements for professional services  and this could adversely affect our operating results 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operational data from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of total revenues and the percentage change in such items compared to the prior period percentage of total revenues period to period change fiscal year ended march  to to revenue software license fees maintenance fees professional services fees total revenues operating expenses cost of software license fees cost of professional services technology development and support sales and marketing administrative and general goodwill amortization restructuring cost total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense interest and investment income interest and other expense total other income income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss reclassified to conform to the presentation 
not meaningful 
effective april   in accordance with fasb  the goodwill balance is no longer being amortized on a monthly basis 
instead  it will be tested at least annually for impairment 
we evaluated the carrying amount of goodwill at march  and determined there was no impairment in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a discussion of net income and earnings per share excluding amortization of goodwill 
effective april   we reorganized our operations to better allow the products and professional services organizations to focus on meeting customer needs 
we have reclassified certain expense items to better reflect our new operating structure and are no longer allocating costs associated with the facilities  finance and human resource departments to the various operating groups 
instead  these costs are now included in administrative and general expenses 
all technology costs  including costs associated with internal systems  are included in the technology development and support expense line 
this reclassification did not change total operating expenses 
in accordance with eitf no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  we have also reclassified travel expense reimbursements paid by customers as revenue rather than as a reduction to the related expense 
this reclassification has resulted in a slight change to professional services fees and cost of professional services without changing income from operations 
we operate in two business segments in the technology industry products and professional services 
we evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on segment contribution before corporate expenses 
references to years are to fiscal years ended march software products revenue our products are designed to support four key activities within the application development process development and integration  quality assurance  production readiness and performance management of the application to optimize performance in production 
products revenue consists of software license fees and maintenance fees and comprised  and of total revenue during  and  respectively 
os product revenue mainframe revenue decreased million or during and decreased million or during revenue from distributed software products decreased million or during and decreased million or during the overall declines in product revenue from to and from to were primarily attributable to decreases in license fees and maintenance fees associated with an overall decrease in technology spending and a decrease in customer demand for large enterprise license agreements elas which are multi year  and often multi payment contracts 
license revenue decreased million or during to million from million during and decreased million or from million during multi year contracts greater than million represented approximately  and of license revenue in  and  respectively 
the decrease in license revenue for and was due to market and competitive pressure on pricing attributed to the continued softness in the economy as a whole and the it industry in particular 
maintenance fees decreased million or to million during from million during and decreased million or from million in the decreases in maintenance fees were primarily attributable to lower license fees during both and resulting in minimal increases to the maintenance base and to market pressure on pricing 
we license our software to our clients using two types of software licenses  perpetual and term 
generally  perpetual software licenses allow our customers a perpetual right to run our software on hardware up to a licensed aggregate mips millions of instructions per second capacity 
term licenses allow our customers a right to run our software for a limited period of time on hardware up to a licensed aggregate mips capacity 
also  our customers purchase maintenance services that provide technical support and advice  including problem resolution services and assistance in product installation  error corrections and any product enhancements released during the maintenance period 
furthermore  based on client needs  we allow our clients the option to license additional software and purchase multiple years of maintenance in a single transaction multi year transactions 
in support of these multi year transactions  we allow extended payment terms to qualifying customers 
to recognize revenue for these multi year transactions the contract price is allocated between maintenance revenue and license revenue 
all license revenue associated with perpetual license agreements is recognized when the customer commits unconditionally to the transaction  the software products and quantities are fixed  the software has been shipped to the customer and there are no known problems with respect to payment 
license revenue associated with term transactions or with transactions that include an option to exchange or select products in the future is deferred and recognized over the term of the agreement 
when the license portion is paid over a number of years  the license portion of the payment stream is discounted to its net present value 
interest income is recognized over the payment term 
the maintenance revenue associated with all sales is deferred and is recognized over the applicable maintenance period 
products revenue by geographic location is presented in the table below in thousands year ended march  united states    europe and africa    other international operations    total products revenue    reclassified to conform to the presentation 
products contribution and expenses financial information for the products segment is as follows in thousands year ended march  revenue    expenses    products contribution    reclassified to conform to the presentation 
the products segment generated contribution margins of  and during  and  respectively 
products expenses include cost of software license fees  technology development and support costs  and sales and marketing expenses 
the decrease in contribution margin during was primarily a result of the decrease in software license revenue offset  in part  by a decrease in products expenses 
the increase in the contribution margin from to was a result of cost reductions offset  in part  by a decrease in license and maintenance revenue 
cost of license fees includes amortization of capitalized software  the cost of preparing and disseminating products to customers and the cost of author royalties 
the decrease in these costs in was due primarily to decreased amortization of purchased software 
the decrease in these costs in was due primarily to decreased author royalties  decreased printing and distribution costs  and decreased salary and benefits associated with lower employee headcount 
as a percentage of software license fees  cost of software license fees were  and in  and  respectively 
technology development and support includes  primarily  the costs of programming personnel associated with product development and support less the amount of software development costs capitalized during the period 
personnel costs associated with developing and maintaining internal systems and hardware software costs required to support technology initiatives are also included here 
the decrease in these costs in was primarily attributable to decreased bonus expense  decreased depreciation of computer equipment  decreased amortization of purchased software  and reduced travel and communication costs 
the decrease in technology costs from to was primarily related to reduced salaries and benefits and reduced travel expenditures offset  in part  by increased amortization of purchased software 
as a percentage of product revenue  costs of technology development and support were  and in  and  respectively 
capitalization of internally developed software products begins when technological feasibility of the product is established 
before the capitalization of internally developed software products  total technology development and support costs for decreased million  or  to million from million in in  total technology development and support costs decreased million  or  to million from million in the major development projects that achieved technological feasibility during included new interactive and debugging products  new fault management products  new file and data management products  new automated testing products  new systems management products  new application development products  new licensing product  new application performance management products  and new windows development tools 
though we continue to place significant emphasis on direct sales through our own sales force  we also market our products through indirect channels 
sales and marketing costs consist primarily of personnel related costs associated with products direct sales and sales support  marketing for all company offerings  and personnel related costs associated with new sales initiatives 
the decrease in sales and marketing costs in was primarily attributable to decreased salaries and benefits  decreased travel expenses  and decreased commissions 
the decrease in sales and marketing costs from to was primarily attributable to decreased salaries and benefits  decreased distributor commissions associated with decreased software license revenue  decreased travel expenses  and decreased advertising expenditures 
as a percentage of license fees  sales and marketing costs were  and in  and  respectively 
professional services revenue we offer a broad range of information technology professional services  including business systems analysis  design and programming  software conversion and system planning and consulting 
revenue from professional services decreased million or during and decreased million or during these decreases in revenue were due  primarily  to a reduction in customer demand for professional services  the january assignment of our prime contract with a client to a company in which we have a minority equity investment  and to a lesser extent  the transfer of our engineering business to an unrelated third party in december professional services revenue was further negatively impacted by the closing of certain underperforming branch offices associated with the restructuring discussed below 
professional services revenue by geographic location is presented in the table below in thousands year ended march  united states    europe and africa    other international operations    total professional services revenue    reclassified to conform to the presentation 
professional services contribution and expenses financial information for our professional services segment is as follows in thousands year ended march  revenue    expenses    professional services contribution    reclassified to conform to the presentation 
the professional services segment generated contribution margins of  and during  and  respectively 
the increase in professional services margin in is primarily a result of the branch closings and other changes discussed in the revenue section above 
the decrease in professional services margin in was primarily due to lower utilization  lower billing rates  and reduced customer demand for our services associated with the decline of the economy as a whole and the it sector specifically 
cost of professional services consists primarily of personnel related costs of providing services  including billable staff  subcontractors and sales personnel 
the decrease in these costs from to is due  primarily  to reductions in staff associated with the restructuring discussed below  resulting in lower salaries and benefits  and decreased use of subcontractors for special services 
the decrease in these costs from to is due  primarily  to reductions in staff  resulting in lower salaries and benefits  reduced travel expenditure and decreased use of subcontractors for special services 
the professional services billable staff decreased  people to  people as of march  from  people at march  this compares to a decrease of  professional billable staff  to  at march  from  people at march  corporate and other expenses administrative and general expenses consist of all other costs associated with the operations and administration of the company 
these costs include the corporate executive  finance  human resources  legal and corporate communications departments 
in addition  administrative and general costs include all facility related costs  such as rent  maintenance  utilities  etc  associated with our local sales and professional services offices 
administrative and general expenses decreased during and decreased during the decrease in administrative and general expenses in was primarily attributable to decreased building rent  decreased telephone costs  and decreased salaries and benefits resulting from the restructuring discussed below offset  in part  by increased legal costs 
legal expenses associated with the ibm litigation increased significantly during the fourth quarter of external legal fees for all litigation and other matters were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these costs are expected to fluctuate in relation to legal activity 
the decrease in administrative and general expenses during was primarily attributable to decreased charges against investments in joint ventures 
interest and investment income for was million compared to million in and million in the decrease from to was due to lower interest earnings on deferred customer receivables offset  in part  by an increase in interest on investments due to higher investment balances 
the decrease from to was due to lower interest earnings on investments due to reduced interest rates  offset  in part  by increased interest related to customers deferred installments 
interest and other expense includes amortization of deferred interest associated with future lease obligations related to facilities no longer used by the company as well as amortization of the initial financing fees and fees associated with the unutilized balance of the prior credit facility discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
interest and other expense for was million as compared to million in and million in the decrease in interest and other expense for is due to the decrease in amortization of initial financing fees and fees associated with the unutilized balance of the credit facility offset  in part  by the increase in amortized interest associated with lease obligations 
the decrease in interest expense from to was primarily attributable to the july payoff of debts previously outstanding under the prior credit facility 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes are provided for the differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
the income tax provision was million in  which represents an effective tax rate of 
this compares to an income tax benefit of million in and an income tax provision of million in  which represents an effective tax rate of 
our effective tax rate for differed significantly from the us federal income tax rate of primarily as a result of nondeductible goodwill amortization and impairment charges 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional analysis of income taxes 
restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of  the company adopted a restructuring plan to reorganize its operating divisions  primarily the professional services segment 
these changes were designed to increase profitability in the future by better aligning cost structures with current market conditions 
the restructuring plan included a reduction of professional services staff at certain locations  the closing of entire professional services offices and a reduction of sales support personnel  lab technicians and related administrative and financial staff 
approximately  employees worldwide were terminated as a result of the reorganization 
payments continue to be made to certain terminated employees in accordance with their separation agreements 
the following table summarizes the accrual for the restructuring and charges against the accrual during fiscal and in thousands employee facilities costs legal  consulting total termination primarily lease and outplacement restructuring benefits abandonments costs other charge restructuring charge     incurred during year ended march   accrual at march      incurred during year ended march     reclassification   accrual at march    lease obligations will end in march of during the year ended march   we determined the accruals associated with employee terminations  legal and outplacement were in excess of actual costs incurred 
these excess accruals have been reclassified to the accrual for facilities costs  since we have not been as successful in subleasing abandoned leased space as originally anticipated 
approximately of the accrual related to facilities costs is included in long term accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet at march  goodwill amortization and impairment charges in fiscal  in conjunction with the development of the restructuring plan  we evaluated the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the professional services business  and recorded an impairment charge related to our prior services acquisitions 
certain professional services offices acquired as part of those acquisitions have not achieved critical mass or a sustained level of profitability and were closed in april as part of the restructuring plan 
we utilized discounted cash flow analyses to value the remaining business  and recognized goodwill impairment based upon current estimated fair market values 
management s discussion of critical accounting policies note of the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our assumptions and estimates were based on the facts and circumstances known at march   future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
these accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be the most important to an understanding of our financial statements  because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we earn revenue from licensing software products  providing maintenance and support for those products and rendering professional services 
our revenue recognition policies are based on us gaap including statements of position and and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin accordingly  we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
software license fees our software license agreements provide our customers with a right to use our software perpetually perpetual licenses or during a defined term term licenses 
perpetual license fee revenue is recognized using the residual method  under which the fair value  based on compuware specific objective evidence csoe  of all undelivered elements of the agreement eg  maintenance and professional services is deferred 
csoe is based on rates charged for maintenance and professional services when sold separately 
the remaining portion of the fee  the residual  net of discretionary discounts  is recognized as license fee revenue upon shipment of the products  provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is deemed probable 
for term licenses and for agreements in which the fair value of the undelivered elements cannot be determined using csoe eg  transactions that include an option to exchange or select products in the future  we recognize the license fee revenue on a ratable basis over the term of the license agreement 
we offer flexibility to customers purchasing products and related maintenance 
terms vary ranging from the standard perpetual license sale to large multi year  multi product contracts 
we allow installment payment terms on multi year contracts  with installments collectible over the term of the contract 
for these contracts  the license fee portion of the receivable is discounted to its net present value 
the discount is recognized as interest income over the term of the receivables 
generally  revenues from license and maintenance transactions that include installment payment terms are recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment 
this is because we have an established business practice of offering installment payment terms to customers and have a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions 
however  because a significant portion of our license fee revenue is earned in connection with installment sales  changes in future economic conditions or technological developments could adversely affect our ability to immediately record license fees for these types of transaction and or limit our ability to collect these receivables 
based on our interpretation of us gaap including statements of position and and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin we believe our revenue has been properly reported 
new interpretations or pronouncements related to software revenue recognition policies could result in changes to our method of revenue recognition in the future 
maintenance fees our maintenance agreements provide for technical support and advice  including problem resolution services and assistance in product installation  error corrections and any product enhancements released during the maintenance period 
maintenance is included with all mainframe software license agreements for at least one year  and for most distributed product agreements for three months 
maintenance is renewable thereafter for an annual fee 
maintenance fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on a ratable basis over the maintenance period 
deferred revenue deferred revenue consists primarily of maintenance fees related to the remaining term of maintenance agreements in effect at those dates 
deferred license fees are also included in deferred revenue for those contracts that are being recognized on a ratable basis 
professional services fees revenues from professional services are recognized in the period the services are performed  provided that collection of the related receivable is deemed probable 
professional services fees are generally based on hourly or daily rates  however  for services rendered under fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
allowance for doubtful accounts the collectibility of accounts receivable is regularly evaluated and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate for our accounts receivable balances 
in evaluating the allowance  we consider historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and the aging of outstanding receivables 
larger accounts are reviewed on a detail basis  giving consideration to collection experience and any information on the financial viability of the customer 
the allowance is reviewed and adjusted each quarter based on the best information available at the time 
capitalized software the cost of purchased and internally developed software is capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost or expected net realizable value 
software is subject to rapid technological obsolescence and estimates of future revenues to be derived from the software could be significantly affected by future developments 
the amortization period for capitalized software is generally five years  but adverse developments could result in a shorter life or a write off based on reduced estimates of net realizable value 
impairment of goodwill we are required to assess the impairment of goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value 
the assessment of goodwill impairment is performed in two steps 
first  the carrying value of each reporting unit products and services is compared to the fair value of the reporting unit including the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value of the reporting unit  we move to the second step of the impairment test 
the second step of the impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the impairment loss shall be recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess 
we measure fair value using an estimate of the related business s discounted cash flow 
the discounted cash flow approach uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  and a terminal growth rate 
these estimates and assumptions  and unknown future events or circumstances eg economic conditions or technological developments could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
other other accounting policies  although not generally subject to the same level of estimation as those discussed above  are nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
many assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses require some degree of estimation or judgment in determining the appropriate accounting 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   cash and investments totaled approximately million 
during and  we generated million and million  respectively  in operating cash flow 
a significant portion of operating cash flow is generated from the collection of the current portion of prior years installment receivables as reflected in the decrease in total accounts receivable 
during these periods  we had capital expenditures that included property and equipment  capitalized research and software development  and purchased software of million and million  respectively 
as of march   we had no long term debt 
the credit facility agreement which would have expired in august was terminated effective november  in may  we entered into a million revolving credit agreement with a bank 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this revolving credit agreement 
there is currently no outstanding balance under the new credit agreement 
we believe available cash resources together with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future 
although there were no acquisitions during  we continue to evaluate business acquisition opportunities that fit our strategic plans 
we are building a new corporate headquarters building with a current estimated cost of million for the building and an estimated million for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
future annual depreciation expense will be approximately million 
this will be partially offset by the savings realized by the consolidation of offices 
capital expenditures to date total million 
remaining cash outlays are expected to be completed in calendar currently  we intend to fund the building using cash on hand and cash flow from operations 
on may   the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan of up to million 
we intend to purchase our common stock on the open market through negotiated or block transactions  periodically  based upon market and business conditions 
as of june   no repurchases have been made under this plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that we take the necessary steps to appropriately reduce the potential impact of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures on our financial position and operating performance 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or forward foreign exchange contracts for investment  speculative or trading purposes 
immediate changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates discussed in the following paragraphs are hypothetical rate scenarios used to calibrate risk and do not currently represent management s view of future market developments 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and installment receivables 
derivative financial instruments are not a part of our investment strategy 
investments are placed with high quality issuers to preserve invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
in addition  marketable debt securities and long term debt investments are classified as held to maturity which does not expose the consolidated statement of operations or balance sheet to fluctuations in interest rates 
the table below provides information about our investment portfolio 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in thousands  except interest rates year ended march  fair value at total march  cash equivalents    average interest rate average interest rate tax equivalent investments      average interest rate average interest rate tax equivalent we offer financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our multi year software sales 
installment accounts are generally receivable over a three to five year period 
as of march   non current receivables amount to million and are due approximately million  million  million  million and million in each of the years ended march  through  respectively 
the fair value of non current accounts receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rate at which the company would finance a similar transaction 
at march   the fair value of such receivables is approximately million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated  negative impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  a change in interest rates will have no impact on cash flows or net income associated with non current accounts receivable 
foreign currency risk we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge amounts due to or from select subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income  offsetting foreign exchange gains or losses on the foreign balances being hedged 
if the underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in income in the same period 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as a hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material net gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign currency denominated balance would be offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract 
we operate in certain countries in latin america and asia pacific where there are limited forward currency exchange markets and thus we have unhedged transaction exposures in these currencies 
the table below provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts at march  the table presents the value of the contracts in us dollars at the contract maturity date and the fair value of the contracts at march  in thousands  except contract rates contract maturity forward fair date in date in contract position in value at rate us dollars march  forward sales canadian dollar march april japanese yen march april norwegian krone march april singapore dollar march april   swiss franc march april forward purchases australian dollar march april   danish krone march april euro dollar march april   swedish krona march april   approximately to of our revenue is derived from foreign sources 
this exposes us to exchange rate risks on foreign currencies related to the fair value of foreign assets and liabilities  net income and cash flows
