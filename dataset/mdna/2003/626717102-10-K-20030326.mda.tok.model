item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company reported net income in of million  per diluted share  compared to net income in of million  per share 
in the company earned million  per diluted share 
all and earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock split effective december  in december the company sold its interest in ship shoal block in the gulf of mexico for an after tax gain of million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which the company adopted on january   the results of operations for ship shoal block have been reflected as discontinued operations in all years presented 
therefore  the aforementioned gain on disposal of million in  and routine operating results of the field  have been included net of income tax expense as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for the three years ended december  income from continuing operations was million in  per share  million in  per share  and million in  per share 

table of contents the three year period ended december  included certain nonrecurring items which can obscure underlying trends of operating results and affect comparability between years 
although results excluding nonrecurring items is considered a non gaap measure  the company s management believes this information is useful in assessing murphy oil s performance 
nonrecurring items reduced income from continuing operations in by million  but increased this amount by million in and million in excluding these nonrecurring items  income from continuing operations amounted to million in  million in  and million in in the company recorded a net charge of million  
per share  as the cumulative effect of an accounting change for a one time non cash adjustment to record crude oil revenues at the time the oil is sold rather than as it is produced 
vs 
income from continuing operations in was million  per share  compared to million  per share  in the decline in results of million was mainly due to a million reduction in refining and marketing results  caused by both weaker refining margins in compared to in the us and us and a million reduction in income from nonrecurring items in the lower income from nonrecurring items was primarily caused by a million gain in from sale of canadian pipeline and trucking operations 
earnings from the company s exploration and production activities were million lower in than in as record levels of oil and natural gas production and higher average oil prices were more than offset by lower natural gas sales prices  higher charges for property impairments and higher production and depreciation expenses 
sales and other operating revenues were million higher in than in due to record production and sales of crude oil and natural gas and higher sales volumes for refined products in north america and the united kingdom 
gain on sale of assets declined by million primarily due to the sale of canadian pipeline and trucking assets in interest and other income was million lower in due to less interest earned on invested cash 
crude oil  natural gas and product purchases increased by million in due to more purchases of finished products for retail marketing operations and a higher average purchase price for these products than in operating expenses rose by million mainly due to record oil and natural gas production  higher maintenance costs for oil and gas producing fields and million of costs to repair uninsured damage from tropical storms in the gulf of mexico 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million in due to higher oil and natural gas production and more retail marketing stations 
interest expense was million more in due to higher average long term borrowings than in  including the sale of year notes with a stated rate of in capitalized interest increased by million due to ongoing projects to develop deepwater gulf of mexico fields  expand syncrude  and build a hydrocracker and expand crude oil throughput capacity at the meraux  louisiana refinery 
income tax expense fell by million essentially in line with lower pretax income from continuing operations 
vs 
income from continuing operations in was a company record million  per share  an increase of million from the million  per share  earned in record earnings in from the company s refining and marketing operations and greater benefits from nonrecurring items were only partially offset by lower income from exploration and production activities 
improved refining and marketing results of million were attributable to stronger unit margins in the us refining business during the first half of and a million nonrecurring profit on sale of canadian pipeline and trucking operations in may exploration and production results declined by million in mainly caused by an reduction in realized oil prices and higher exploration expenses 
these were partially offset by higher oil and natural gas production and lower charges for property impairments 
sales and other operating revenues in increased by million compared to due to higher oil  natural gas and refined product sales volumes 
gain on sale of assets was up by million due to the sale in may of the canadian pipeline and trucking operations 
interest and other income was million lower in due to less interest earned on invested cash balances and lower interest associated with settlement of prior year tax issues 
crude oil  natural gas and product purchases were million higher due to more purchases of crude oil and refined products  with this effort partially mitigated by a lower average price than in operating expenses increased by million due to higher oil and natural gas production and more retail gasoline stations 
the increase of million in exploration expenses is explained on page selling and general expenses increased by million primarily due to higher salaries and benefits and legal and professional fees in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense rose by million due to a combination of higher oil and gas production and more retail marketing stations

the effects of nonrecurring items on quarterly results of and are presented on page f of this form k report 
exploration and production earnings from exploration and production operations were million in  million in and million in the decline in was caused by a lower average natural gas sales price in north america  higher costs associated with property impairments and higher production and depreciation expenses 
the unfavorable effects of these items were partially offset by record production of both crude oil and natural gas and a higher average sales price for crude oil and condensate 
oil production from continuing operations increased by in to  barrels per day and natural gas production from continuing operations 
table of contents rose by to million cubic feet per day 
higher property impairment expense in was mostly related to the write off of remaining costs for destin dome blocks and  offshore florida 
based on an agreement with the us government  the company may not seek approval for development of this significant natural gas discovery in destin dome until at least the decline in was primarily attributable to an decline in the company s average oil sales price compared to additionally  exploration expenses increased over  a significant portion of which were in foreign jurisdictions where the company has no realized income tax benefits 
production of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids from continuing operations increased from  barrels per day in to  in  a increase

a summary of oil and gas revenues from continuing operations  including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  is presented in the following table 
millions of dollars united states crude oil natural gas canada crude oil natural gas synthetic oil united kingdom crude oil natural gas ecuador crude oil total oil and gas revenues the company s crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids production from continuing operations averaged  barrels per day in   in and  in oil production in the united states declined to  barrels per day in  following an decline in the reduction in both years was primarily due to declines from existing fields in the gulf of mexico 
oil production in canada increased in to a record volume of  barrels per day 
the terra nova field  offshore newfoundland  commenced production in january and averaged  barrels per day for the year 
the company s share of net production at its synthetic oil operation improved barrels per day  or  in due to a combination of higher gross production and a lower net profit royalty caused by higher capital spending related to an ongoing expansion project 
before royalties  the company s synthetic oil production was  barrels per day in   in and  in production of light oil decreased barrels per day  or  and heavy oil production decreased to  barrels per day in with both decreases primarily due to declines at existing western canada fields 
production at hibernia rose in to  barrels per day due to better operating efficiency 
uk production was down by  barrels per day  or  primarily due to declines from the company s t block and ninian fields in the north sea 
the company produced  barrels of oil per day in ecuador  lower than in  primarily due to further pipeline constraints on the existing oil pipeline 
an additional pipeline is scheduled to commence operation in the second half of during  oil production in the united states declined compared to and averaged  barrels per day 
the reduction was due to declines from existing fields in the gulf of mexico 
oil production in canada increased in to  barrels per day 
the company s share of net production at its synthetic oil operation improved  barrels per day  or  in due to both higher gross production and a lower net profit royalty caused by increased capital spending and a lower oil price 
production of light oil increased  barrels per day  or  and heavy oil production increased to  barrels per day in with both increases primarily due to the company s acquisition of beau canada in november production at hibernia rose in to  barrels per day due to 
table of contents better operating efficiency  primarily associated with improved handling of gas production 
uk production was down by barrels per day  or  due to declines from the company s existing fields in the north sea 
oil production in ecuador was lower than and totaled  barrels per day 
this reduction was caused by more pipeline constraints  which forced the operation to limit daily production 
worldwide sales of natural gas from continuing operations were a record million cubic feet per day in  up from million in natural gas sales were million cubic feet per day in sales of natural gas in the united states were million cubic feet per day in  million in and million in the reductions in and were due to lower deliverability from maturing fields in the gulf of mexico 
natural gas sales in canada in were at record levels for the seventh consecutive year as sales increased to million cubic feet per day 
canadian natural gas sales had increased more than in the increase in was primarily due to higher production from the ladyfern field  while the increase was due to the acquisition of beau canada in late and from new discoveries  including ladyfern  in western canada 
natural gas sales in the united kingdom were million cubic feet per day in  down compared to uk natural gas sales in increased compared to levels and totaled million cubic feet per day 
the lower production in was due to declines at the amethyst field in the north sea  while the added volumes in were attributable to higher production at both the amethyst and mungo monan fields 
the average sales price for light crude oil in was comparable to  however  heavy oil prices were significantly stronger in comparison to light oil prices during the year 
in the united states  the company s average monthly sales price for crude oil and condensate declined compared to and averaged per barrel for the year 
in canada  the sales price for light oil rose to per barrel 
heavy oil prices in canada averaged per barrel  up from the sales price for crude oil from the hibernia field rose to per barrel 
the average sales price for oil from the new terra nova field was per barrel 
synthetic oil prices in were per barrel  up from a year ago 
sales prices in the uk were about flat with at per barrel and sales prices in ecuador were up to per barrel 
worldwide crude oil sales prices declined during compared to in the united states  the company s average sales price for crude oil and condensate was per barrel for the year  down compared to in canada  sales prices for light oil fell to per barrel 
canadian heavy oil prices were down from and averaged per barrel 
the sales price for hibernia crude oil decreased to per barrel 
synthetic oil prices in averaged per barrel  down from a year ago 
sales prices in the uk were per barrel  a decline of  and sales prices in ecuador were down to per barrel 
the company s north american natural gas sales prices were weaker during compared to due generally to a warmer than normal winter 
natural gas sales prices in north america decreased from and averaged per mcf in compared to in the prior year 
us natural gas sales prices decreased in and averaged per mcf compared to in the prior year 
canadian natural gas production was sold in at an average price of per mcf  lower than in the sales price for natural gas sold in the united kingdom increased to per mcf 
north american natural gas sales price averaged per mcf for the year compared to in us sales prices averaged per mcf compared to a year ago 
however  the sales price for natural gas sold in canada declined to per mcf 
prices in the united kingdom increased to per mcf from in based on volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each per barrel and 
per mcf fluctuation in prices would have affected annual exploration and production earnings by million and million  respectively 
the effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the company s refining and marketing segments could be affected differently 
production expenses were million in  million in and million in these amounts are shown by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
costs per equivalent barrel during the last three years excluding discontinued operations were as follows 

table of contents dollars per equivalent barrel united states canada excluding synthetic oil synthetic oil united kingdom ecuador worldwide excluding synthetic oil the increase in the cost per equivalent barrel in the united states in both and was attributable to a combination of lower production and higher well servicing costs 
lower average costs in for canada  excluding synthetic oil  was due to higher natural gas production volumes and new production from the terra nova field  offshore newfoundland 
the decrease in canada during  excluding synthetic oil  was primarily due to higher production of light oil  heavy oil and natural gas 
the lower average cost per barrel for canadian synthetic oil in was due to a combination of lower maintenance costs and higher net production  while the increased cost in was due to higher maintenance costs 
the increase in average costs in the uk in was due to both higher costs to maintain mature properties  primarily at the ninian field  and lower overall production 
the increase in the united kingdom during was also the result of higher costs for mature properties 
higher costs per unit in ecuador in and were both due to lower oil production compared to the previous year 
exploration expenses for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table  and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages f and f on this form k report 
certain of the expenses are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities 
millions of dollars exploration and production dry hole costs geological and geophysical cost other costs undeveloped lease amortization total exploration expenses the increase in dry hole costs in was caused by higher costs for unsuccessful exploration drilling wells in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico and malaysia  which were offset in part by lower costs in for wells off the east coast of canada 
dry hole costs were higher in than in as more unsuccessful drilling costs off the east coast of canada were partially offset by lower costs in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
geological and geophysical costs were down in due to less spending for d seismic on deepwater concessions in malaysia 
other exploration expenses were lower in primarily due to more recoveries from the company s partner in malaysia 
undeveloped leasehold amortization increased in compared to primarily because of lease acquisitions in western canada 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense related to exploration and production operations totaled million in  million in and million in higher costs in were caused by record oil and natural gas production  including start up of the terra nova field in january  and more production from the ladyfern field in western canada 
the increase in was also due to higher oil and natural gas production volumes during the year 
the effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations was lower by approximately of pretax earnings in compared to primarily due to higher benefits in the latter year from settlement of prior year tax matters 
approximately of the company s us proved oil reserves and of the us proved natural gas reserves are undeveloped 
at december   about of the total us undeveloped reserves relate to deepwater gulf of mexico fields  including medusa  front runner and habanero  which are currently being developed by the company 
medusa is expected to come on stream at mid year habanero should start up in the third quarter and 
table of contents front runner is currently projected to produce first oil in on a worldwide basis  the company has spent approximately million in  million in and million in to develop its undeveloped proved reserves 
the company expects to spend about million in  million in and million in to move undeveloped proved reserves to the developed category 
the us securities and exchange commission sec is currently in the process of obtaining information from murphy and other oil and gas companies operating in the gulf of mexico to assess how the industry is determining proved reserves related to new field discoveries 
sec regulations allow oil companies to recognize proved reserves if economic producibility is supported by either an actual production test or conclusive formation test 
in the absence of a production test  compelling technical data must exist to recognize proved reserves related to the initial discovery of the oil or natural gas field 
production tests in deepwater environments are extremely expensive and the oil industry has increasingly depended on advanced technical testing to support economic producibility 
murphy has recorded proved reserves related to the initial discovery of four offshore fields based on conclusive formation tests rather than actual production tests 
at the end of  proved reserves for these four fields totaled million barrels of oil equivalent  or approximately of the company s worldwide proved reserves  including synthetic oil 
three of the fields are currently being developed  including the medusa  front runner and habanero fields  with expected first production for these fields ranging from mid to the first half of murphy believes the proved reserves are properly classified 
murphy has furnished the information requested by the sec and is unable to predict the outcome of the sec s staff review of the industry s practices 
this issue is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial results 
if the issue is not favorably resolved  the company may be required to revise the manner in which it reports its proved reserves  which could affect its finding costs per barrel and reserve replacement ratios 
refining and marketing the company s refining and marketing operations lost million in earnings from this business were a record million in  including nonrecurring gains  while earnings in totaled million 
the unfavorable result in was due to two reasons extremely weak refining margins throughout most of the year in both the united states and united kingdom and a million gain in on sale of the company s former canadian pipeline and trucking operations 
crude oil feedstock prices at the company s us and us refineries were and higher  respectively  in than in and the increase in wholesale and retail sales prices for refined products in did not match the increased costs of crude oil in the markets served by the company 
north american operations  which now includes refining activities in the us and marketing activities in the us and canada and formerly included pipeline and trucking operations in canada prior to the sale of this business in  lost million in compared to profits of million in and million in the year included the aforementioned million gain on sale of pipeline and trucking operations in canada 
excluding this gain  the results were much improved over due to stronger refining and marketing margins and a higher percentage of sales through the company s retail stations at wal mart sites 
prior to the sale of the canadian operations in  this business generated a profit of million in and million in operations in the uk lost 
million in  but earned million and million in and  respectively 
the declines in and earnings compared to the prior year in the uk were caused by generally weaker refining margins than in the year before 
unit margins sales realizations less costs of crude oil  other feedstocks  refining operating expenses and depreciation and transportation to point of sale averaged 
per barrel in north america in  in and in north american product sales volumes increased to a record  barrels per day in  following a increase in sales volumes through the company s retail gasoline network at wal mart stores continued to grow steadily throughout  but lower sales volumes into the wholesale market  caused by lower finished products produced by the company s refineries  mostly offset this increase 
higher product sales volumes in was attributable to a combination of higher crude oil throughputs compared to the previous year at the company s us refineries  plus continued expansion of the company s retail gasoline network at wal mart stores 
unit margins in the united kingdom averaged per barrel in  in and in sales of petroleum products were up in to  barrels per day  while volumes were higher than  with both years increases caused by higher volumes sold in the cargo market 
both us and us operations were experiencing losses during january due to unit margins being significantly weaker during this period compared to the average 

table of contents based on sales volumes for and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each 
per barrel 
per gallon fluctuation in the unit margins would have affected annual refining and marketing profits by million 
the effect of these unit margin fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the company s exploration and production segments could be affected differently 
corporate the costs of corporate activities  which include interest income and expense and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions  were million in  million in and million in the higher net cost in compared to was due to a combination of more net interest expense associated with higher borrowings and lower interest income earned 
net costs were higher in than in mainly because the earlier year included more income tax benefits and associated interest income from settlement of prior year tax matters 
capital expenditures as shown in the selected financial data on page of this form k report  capital expenditures  including discretionary exploration expenditures  were million in compared to million in and million in these amounts included million  million and million of exploration costs that were expensed 
capital expenditures for exploration and production activities totaled million in  of the company s total capital expenditures for the year 
exploration and production capital expenditures in included million for acquisition of undeveloped leases  million for exploration activities  and million for development projects 
development expenditures included million for development of deepwater discoveries in the gulf of mexico  million for the terra nova and hibernia oil fields  offshore newfoundland  million for expansion of synthetic oil operations at the syncrude project in canada  and million for heavy oil and natural gas projects in western canada

the increase in long term debt in was attributable to new borrowings associated with the company s capital expenditure program  including deepwater gulf of mexico development projects  continued expansion of the syncrude plant and an expansion project at the company s meraux  louisiana refinery 
long term debt totaled million at the end of compared to million at december  stockholders equity was billion at the end of compared to billion a year ago and billion at the end of a summary of transactions in stockholders equity accounts is presented on page f of this form k report

the expansion projects at the meraux refinery include construction of a hydrocracker unit that will allow the refinery to produce low sulfur products  an expansion of the crude oil processing capacity from  barrels per day to  barrels per day  and construction of an additional sulfur recovery complex 
see further discussion regarding the meraux projects on page of this form k report 
the primary sources of the company s liquidity are internally generated funds  access to outside financing and working capital 
the company typically relies on internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures  but maintains lines of credit with banks and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements 
the company anticipates that long term debt will increase during because of significant capital expenditure commitments  as described in the preceding paragraph  and an expectation that oil and natural gas prices for much of will remain below trading ranges experienced in at december   the company had access to short term and long term revolving credit facilities in the amount of million 
in addition  the company has a shelf registration on file with the us securities and exchange commission that permits the offer and sale of up to million in debt and equity securities 
current financing arrangements are set forth more fully in note f to the consolidated financial statements 
at february  the company s long term debt rating by standard and poor s was a and by moody s was baal 
the company s ratio of earnings to fixed charges was to in  to in and to in environmental murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations 
the most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting the company s operations are the clean air act  as amended the federal water pollution control act safe drinking water act regulations of the united states department of the interior governing offshore oil and gas operations these acts and their associated regulations set limits on emissions and  in the case of discharges to water  establish water quality limits 
they also  in most cases  require permits in association with new or modified operations 
many states also have similar statutes and regulations governing air and water  which in some cases impose additional and 
table of contents more stringent requirements 
murphy is also subject to certain acts and regulations primarily governing remediation of wastes or oil spills 
the applicable acts are the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  commonly referred to as superfund  and comparable state statutes 
cercla primarily addresses historic contamination and imposes joint and several liability for cleanup of contaminated sites on owners and operators of the sites 
as discussed below  murphy is involved in a limited number of superfund sites 
cercla also requires reporting of releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous 
the resource conservation and recovery act of  as amended  and comparable state statutes  govern the management and disposal of wastes  with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment  storage or disposal of hazardous wastes at the owner s property 
the oil pollution act of  as amended  under which owners and operators of tankers  owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines  and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the united states 
pursuant to the authority of the clean air act caa  the environmental protection agency epa has issued several standards applicable to the formulation of motor fuels  which are designed to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants when the fuel enters commerce or is used 
pursuant to state laws corresponding to the caa  several states have passed similar or more stringent regulations governing the formulation of motor fuels 
the company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims  allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in the company s operations 
the company operates or has previously operated certain sites and facilities  including three refineries  terminals  and approximately service stations  for which known or potential obligations for environmental remediation exist 
in addition the company operates or has operated numerous oil and gas fields that may require some form of remediation  this cost is generally provided for within the company s liability for accrued dismantlement costs 
under the company s accounting policies  an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
if there is a range of reasonably estimated costs  the most likely amount will be recorded  or if no amount is most likely  the minimum of the range is used 
recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly 
actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized 
the company s liability for remedial obligations includes certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites 
if regulatory authorities require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes  future expenditures could exceed the accrued liability by up to an estimated million 
the company has received notices from the us environmental protection agency epa that it is currently considered a potentially responsible party prp at two superfund sites 
the potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial 
at one site the company has agreed to pay  to obtain a release from further obligations 
the company s insurance carrier has agreed to reimburse the  based on currently available information  the company has reason to believe that it is also a de minimus party as to ultimate responsibility at the other superfund site 
the company has not recorded a liability for remedial costs on superfund sites 
the company could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating prps or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at the one remaining site or other superfund sites 
the company does not believe that the ultimate costs to clean up the two superfund sites will have a material adverse effect on its net income or cash flows in a future period 
there is the possibility that environmental expenditures could be required at currently unidentified sites  and new or revised regulations could require additional expenditures at known sites 
however  based on information currently available to the company  the amount of future remediation costs incurred at known or currently unidentified sites is not expected to have a material adverse effect on future earnings or cash flows 
certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by the company from other sources  primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states 
since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur  the company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries at december  
table of contents the company s refineries also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances 
the types of waste and substances disposed of generally fall into the following categories spent catalysts usually hydrotreating catalysts  spent used filter media  tank bottoms and api separator sludge  contaminated soils  laboratory and maintenance spent solvents  and various industrial debris 
the costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and amounted to million in in addition to these expenses  murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
such capital expenditures were approximately million in and are projected to be million in other matters impact of inflation general inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the company operates  however  the company s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation 
crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand  with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future 
natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand  which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas 
because crude oil and natural gas sales prices were strong during late and early  prices for oil field goods and services could be adversely affected in the future 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services

significant accounting policies in preparing the company s financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
application of certain of the company s accounting policies requires significant estimates 
these accounting policies are described below 
proved oil and natural gas reserves proved reserves are defined by the us securities and exchange commission sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although the company s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates utilized by the company 
the company cannot predict the type of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
successful efforts accounting the company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income 
successful exploration drilling costs and all development capital expenditures are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the company s engineers 
the company also uses proved developed reserves to recognize expense for future estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs 
costs of exploration wells in progress at year end were not significant 
impairment of long lived assets the company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment and goodwill in the consolidated balance sheets to make sure that they are fairly presented 
the company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
goodwill must be evaluated for impairment at least annually 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable adjustments to reserves  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
all of these same factors must be considered when testing a property s carrying value for impairment 
the company can not predict the amount of impairment charges that may be recorded in the future 
income taxes the company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period  b tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle  and c future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the company 
the company has deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences in ecuador and malaysia 
the company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization 
a valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets related to ecuador and malaysia due to management s belief that these assets are not likely to be realized 
the company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns 
although the company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities  gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters 

table of contents legal  environmental and other contingent matters a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and other contingent matters 
in addition  the company often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters  and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the company 
contractual obligations and guarantees the company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements  operating leases  throughput contract  hydrogen supply agreement and capital commitments 
total payments due after under such contractual obligations are shown below 
amounts due millions of dollars total after long term debt operating leases throughput contract hydrogen purchases capital commitments total in the normal course of its business  the company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the company fails to perform under those contracts 
the amount of commitments that expire in future periods is shown below 
commitment expiration per period millions of dollars total after financial guarantees letters of credit total outlook prices for the company s primary products are often quite volatile 
during late and early  crude oil prices increased significantly primarily due to the near term potential for a conflict between iraq and a us led coalition of armed forces coupled with a nationwide oil worker strike in venezuela that virtually halted oil exports from this opec nation 
because of the generally recognized war premium built into oil prices in early  earnings and cash flows from the company s refining and marketing operations remained very weak 
natural gas prices in late and early were stronger than the average for  mainly due to a combination of cold weather in the early winter period and lower gas storage levels compared to the same time a year earlier 
if a conflict in iraq occurs  worldwide crude oil prices could change significantly depending on the war s effect on middle eastern oil production 
in such a volatile environment  constant reassessment of spending plans is required 
the company s capital expenditure budget for was prepared during the fall of and provides for expenditures of million 
of this amount  million or  is allocated for exploration and production 
geographically  of the exploration and production budget is allocated to the united states  including million for development of deepwater projects in the gulf of mexico  another is allocated to canada  including million for natural gas development  million for heavy oil development  million for continued development of the hibernia and terra nova fields  and million for further expansion of synthetic oil operations  is allocated to exploration and development in malaysia  and the remaining is planned for other areas  including ecuador and the united kingdom 
budgeted refining and marketing capital expenditures for are million  including million in north america and million in the united kingdom 
planned spending in north america include funds to complete the clean fuels and crude throughput expansion projects at the meraux refinery and to build over additional gasoline stations at wal mart sites 
capital and other expenditures are under constant review and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect changes in estimated cash flow during 
table of contents based on the company s projected capital expenditures in and continued refining and marketing margins early in the year  a portion of capital expenditures is anticipated to be funded through new long term borrowings during the year 
murphy s budget anticipates an increase in long term debt of approximately million during the year 
although the company is actively managing capital expenditures in light of operating cash flows  it is possible that long term debt could exceed the budgeted year end levels  especially if cash flows are adversely affected in the upcoming months by a weakening of oil and natural gas sales prices and continued weak refining and marketing margins such as those experienced in late and early in order to reduce volatility of oil and natural gas prices  the company has entered into a series of financial contracts that cover approximately of the company s anticipated oil and natural gas production 
the swap and collar contracts are accounted for as qualified hedges of sales prices and are more fully described on page of this report 
murphy s oil and natural gas production profile will continue to grow in two new deepwater gulf of mexico fields  medusa and habanero  will start up in also  the west patricia field in block sk  offshore sarawak  malaysia is expected to produce first oil in the second quarter of a new heavy oil pipeline in ecuador that is owned by others should be online in late  this should allow the company s daily production to more than double in this country by year end these new fields will more than offset normal production declines at other fields 
total production for should average  to  barrels of oil equivalent per day 
in early  the company signed a letter of intent to sell its interests in the ninian and columba fields in the uk north sea at a price of million 
this sale is expected to close in the second quarter murphy oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees 
during  the company reduced the expected investment return for assets held in its us retirement plans from to 
the company has decided to reduce its expected return to in due to a reduction in bond yields during  the company has also reduced the plans discount rates from in to in the funded status of the company s retirement plans was adversely affected over the last two years by changes in assumptions used to calculate plan liabilities and a negative actual return on plan assets 
the smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tend to buffer the current year s pension expense from wide swings in liabilities and asset returns 
the effect of negative asset returns and liability changes will adversely impact the company s pension expense in the company s annual retirement plan expense is estimated to increase by about million for compared to the company is required to fund payments of 
million into one union plan in unless asset values recover during the next few years  the company s pension expense will continue to be adversely affected by negative asset returns experienced in recent years 
in addition  the company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years
