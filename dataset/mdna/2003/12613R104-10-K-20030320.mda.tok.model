we believe that existing funds will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs to cover operating losses and for working capital fluctuations and for capital expenditures for the next months 
management intends to consider using cash to optimize our capital structure  which could include the repurchase  from time to time  of a portion of our outstanding debt securities or equity securities

any purchases of common stock in the open market will be conducted in accordance with rule b depending upon a variety of circumstances  the amount involved may be material 
we do not anticipate the need for additional funding in the foreseeable future

although we have not presently identified alternate or additional sources of long term capital  if our cash needs were to change  or if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our convertible subordinated notes by when they are due  we will need to raise additional capital through debt or equity offerings in the public or private markets 
our ability to raise such additional capital will depend on market conditions at that time

on february   spg filed its election to seek a retrial on the issue of corrective advertising in lieu of the ten dollar remittur 
the re trial has been taken off calendar pending a ruling from the court on whether the re trial should be dismissed 
under indiana law  the amount of punitive damages is capped at the greater of three times compensatory damages or  accordingly  it is not possible to determine the amount of punitive damages  if any  that may be payable until the issue of damages for corrective advertising has been resolved 
it is not possible to predict the amount of damages attributable to corrective advertising that could be awarded in a re trial  however  if the determination is adverse to us  the amounts could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
on december   mysimon filed a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence it believes spg should have produced prior to the august trial 
the parties have submitted briefs on this issue and are awaiting the judge s decision

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  investments  goodwill and intangible assets  lease abandonment  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues once the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of our obligation to our customer has occurred the price to be charged to the buyer is fixed or determinable collectibility of the fees to be charged is reasonably assured we have several revenue streams 
for each revenue stream  evidence of the arrangement  delivery and pricing may be different 
for all revenue streams  we determine that collectibility is reasonably assured through a standardized credit review to determine each customer s credit worthiness 
we recognize revenues from the sale of our interactive messaging and banner advertisements on our online network in the period in which the advertisements are delivered 
the arrangements are evidenced either by insertion order or contract that stipulate the types of advertising to be delivered and pricing 
our customers are billed based on a discounted list price with no amounts subject to refund 
when recognizing revenues  the discounts granted are applied to each type of advertisement purchased based on the relative fair value of each element 
we refer to the fees charged to merchants based on the number of users who click on an advertisement or text link to visit websites of our merchant partners as leads 
for leads  the arrangement is evidenced by a contract that stipulates the lead fee 
the fee becomes fixed and determinable upon delivery of the lead 
these revenues are recognized in the period in which the leads are delivered to the merchant  and are therefore not subject to refund 
in certain arrangements  we sell interactive messaging  banner advertising  and leads programs to customers as part of a bundled arrangement 
for these arrangements  we allocate revenue to each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each deliverable 
revenue is recognized in these arrangements as we deliver on our obligation 
advertising revenues from our print and custom print publications are recognized in the month that the related publications are sent to subscribers or become available at newsstands 
newsstand revenue from our print publications is recognized when the publications are delivered to the newsstand at which time a reserve is recorded against the value of the publications delivered based on the number of magazines that we expect to be returned 
to ensure these reserves are adequate  we review the sell through history of the publications on a monthly basis 
revenues for subscriptions to our internet sites  print publications  product database and procurement services are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the subscription 
upon execution of a contract  billing and commencement of the services  we record deferred revenue for the fee charged 
this deferred revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the arrangement 
the amounts under contract are not refundable after the customer has used the service 
we trade advertising on our internet sites in exchange for advertisements on the internet sites of other companies  referred to as barter revenue 
these revenues are recognized in the period in which the advertisements are delivered based on the fair market value of the services delivered 
we determine the fair market value of the service delivered based upon amounts charged for similar services in non barter deals within the previous six month period 
collectibility of receivables we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our allowances on periodic assessment of our customer s liquidity and financial condition through credit rating agencies reports  financial statement reviews and historical collection trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and thereby result in an inability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
goodwill and intangibles impairment in july  the fasb issued sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations subsequent to june  and specifies criteria for recognizing intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
the implementation of sfas has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
effective january  under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but instead are to be tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with definite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
although the provisions of sfas were not effective in their entirety until january   the goodwill acquired in business combinations which occurred after june  fell under the condition of sfas requiring no amortization of goodwill arising from transactions completed after june  therefore  goodwill arising from any such transactions have not been amortized 
as part of the transition provisions of sfas  we were required to review for impairment all previously recognized intangible assets that have been determined to have indefinite useful lives 
for the purposes of the sfas review  we have identified our reporting units as follows us media excluding computer shopper  computer shopper  channel services  asia and europe 
we completed this transition impairment testing during the second quarter of in no instance did the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceed its fair value as of january   and therefore  we determined that there was no impairment resulting from these transitions tests 
we performed the transition impairment tests by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit s net assets  including goodwill  to the fair value of each reporting unit having goodwill 
we have performed our annual evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets impairment as of august  the fair value of our reporting units was determined using a combination of the income and the market valuation approaches 
other intangible assets were valued using a combination of the income and cost approaches 
in the application of the income  market and cost valuation approaches  we were required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables 
actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates  including as a result of changes in the economy  the business in which we operate  and or our own relative performance 
the results of this annual impairment test indicated the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets for the us media reporting unit exceeded their implied fair values and an impairment charge of million for goodwill and of million for intangible assets of that reporting unit was recorded in the third quarter of goodwill and intangible assets of a reporting unit are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of its goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable 
impairment of reporting unit goodwill is evaluated based on a comparison of the reporting unit s carrying value to the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
conditions that indicate that impairment of goodwill should be evaluated include a sustained decrease in our market value or an adverse change in business climate 
on an ongoing basis  we will review goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis with a valuation date of august having been established as the date on which this annual review will take place 
lease abandonment in  we completed an evaluation of our real estate requirements taking into account the workforce reductions that had occurred  the completion of our new facility in san francisco  and redundant facilities elsewhere within the u 
s and internationally 
this evaluation resulted in the consolidation or abandonment of several leased facilities 
due to the decline in the commercial real estate markets in these locations  it was expected that the abandoned leased facilities would be vacant for several quarters  and once they were subleased  it would be at rates below current contractual requirements 
we recorded a charge related to the abandonment  based on the difference between the expected cash outflows and the expected cash inflows related to these vacated properties 
we periodically review such factors as further declines in the commercial real estate markets  our ability to terminate leases  or requirement to abandon additional properties  and based on these reviews  we will adjust our leasehold abandonment reserve  as necessary 
the amounts we will ultimately realize could be materially different from the amounts assumed in arriving at our estimate of the costs of the lease abandonment 
contingencies we evaluate whether a liability must be recorded for contingencies based on whether a liability is probable and estimable 
our most significant contingencies are related to our ongoing mysimon litigation as described in item legal proceedings and our lease guarantee for office space in new york city as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
if the financial condition of any of the sublessees or the primary lessee were to deteriorate and thereby result in an inability to make their lease payments  we would be required to make additional lease payments under the guarantee 
in regards to the ongoing mysimon litigation  it is not possible to predict the amount of damages attributable to corrective advertising that could be awarded in a re trial  however  if the determination is adverse to us  the amounts could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement rescinds sfas  reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt wherein the fasb determined that gains and losses from debt extinguishments were to be recorded as extraordinary items 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after may   with earlier adoption encouraged 
during the second quarter of  cnet adopted sfas and as such is no longer presenting gain or loss associated with debt extinguishment as an extraordinary item 
see note to the financial statements for the year ended december  in item in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement supercedes emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
under sfas  the fasb has concluded that an entity s commitment to a plan does not necessarily create a present obligation to others that meets the definition of a liability 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our operation results or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued a consensus  which clarified certain issues within eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the consensus addresses how to allocate the revenue in an arrangement involving multiple deliverables into separate units of accounting consistent with the identified separate earnings processes of each deliverable for revenue recognition purposes 
the issue also addresses how each element in a bundled sales arrangement should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
the consensus is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect the implementation of this consensus to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of sfas  and and a rescission of fin the interpretation expands the disclosure requirements for most guarantees 
fin also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have expanded our disclosure relating to our lease guarantee accordingly 
we have expanded our disclosure relating to its lease guarantee accordingly 
we have currently evaluating other aspects of fin to determine its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirement of sfas to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation  regardless of which accounting method is used to account for stock based compensation 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  cnet has adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements 
fin addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
fin expands disclosure if an enterprise consolidates a variable interest entity  and the interpretation requires disclosure for those companies that hold significant variable interests in a variable interest entity but are not required to consolidate that interest 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities obtained after that date 
fin applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which a company holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  disclosure required by fin must be included in all financial statements issued after january  we are currently analyzing fin to determine its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
cautionary statement regarding factors that may affect our business  financial condition and future results our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are any statements about our future that are not statements of historical fact 
examples of forward looking statements include projections of earnings  revenues or other financial items  statements of the plans and objectives of management for future operations  statements concerning proposed new products or services  statements regarding future economic conditions or performance  and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
in some cases  you can identify these statements by the use of words such as may  will  expects  should  believes  predicts  plans  anticipates  estimates  potential  continue or the negative of these terms  or any other words of similar meaning 
these statements are only predictions 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this report and in any of our other public statements may turn out to be wrong 
they can be effected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties  some of which are outlined below under risk factors 
many risk factors mentioned in the discussion in this report will be important in determining future results 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed 
actual events or results may differ materially from the outcomes we predict 
these forward looking statements are made only as of the date of this report  and we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our q and k reports to the sec 
also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks  uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses 
these are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect us 
this discussion is provided as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of risk factors our annual revenues have decreased in compared to the past two fiscal years 
there can be no assurances that our revenues will grow or that they will not continue to decrease 
our revenues have decreased in compared to the past two fiscal years 
there can be no assurance that our revenues will grow in the future or that they will not decrease further 
some of the factors that might contribute to decreased revenue or that might impede our revenue growth in the future include continued or worsening weakness in corporate and consumer spending for technology  resulting in a decrease in technology marketing  which is the primary source of our revenues the loss of advertisers and other marketing customers for various reasons loss of advertising and other marketing opportunities to competitors  especially as other media companies increase their offerings of information and shopping services in the fields of technology  computing and the internet inability to attract customers to our newer businesses failure of users to adopt our newer paid offerings such as gamespot complete and upload paid services worsening of general economic conditions  as well as economic conditions specific to advertising  the internet and internet media disruption of our operations due to technical difficulties  system downtime  internet brownouts or denial of service or other similar attacks disruption to our operations  employees  partners  customers and facilities caused by international or domestic terrorist attacks or armed conflict any decrease in our revenues or any failure to meet our revenue guidance could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have generated significant losses since inception and cannot assure you that we will report positive net income in the future 
if our revenues do not increase  we may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to achieve net income 
we have generated an operating loss in six of the past seven years and have generated a net loss in five of the past seven years 
for the year ended december   we recognized a net loss of million and have an accumulated deficit of billion at december  we expect to incur a net loss in fiscal year and may incur additional losses in the future 
one of the reasons that we have generated losses in the past two years is that we have been unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for revenue shortfalls 
depending on the nature and timing of capital expenditures and other costs  the expansion of our operations and the introduction of new sites and services  we may continue to be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for revenue shortfalls 
any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to planned expenditures could materially reduce our operating results and could adversely affect our financial condition 
competition is intense 
our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our prospects and financial results 
the market for internet content and services is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
it is not difficult to enter this market and current and new competitors can launch new internet sites at relatively low cost 
we derive our revenue primarily from marketing  for which we compete with various media including newspapers  radio  magazines and various internet sites that offer consumers information similar to that which we provide 
existing online  print  television and radio media companies have expanded their content in the field of technology  computing and consumer electronics 
in addition  the number of companies providing online comparison shopping  one of the primary components of our revenues  has increased 
we cannot assure you that we will compete successfully with current or future competitors 
moreover  increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and profits 
if we do not compete successfully for new users and advertisers  our financial results may be materially and adversely affected 
if we engage in further workforce reductions  we will incur severance and similar costs that could cause our operating results to be lower than forecast in the quarter in which those activities occur 
in  we undertook to simplify and streamline our businesses through workforce reductions and business closures that resulted in integration  realignment and severance costs of approximately million 
if we reduce our workforce or business operations further or take other steps to simplify our business and reduce our operating costs  we could experience additional restructuring and severance costs in amounts that could be material 
these costs could cause our operating results for the quarter in which the actions occur to be lower than our forecasted results 
we continue to have liability under abandoned real estate leases 
in  we performed an evaluation of our domestic and international real estate requirements 
this evaluation resulted in the consolidation or abandonment of several leased facilities 
in connection with these abandoned leases  we had established an accrual for lease abandonment 
the balance for this accrual was million at december  an additional million was added to the accrual in when certain assumptions regarding the timing of subleasing were modified and as further consolidation of the us facilities took place 
cash expenditure reductions to this accrual have been million 
at december   a balance of million remained in this accrual 
if we are unable to either negotiate reduced payment arrangements or find suitable sublessees  we could experience liabilities under those leases in excess of our remaining accrual 
the total undiscounted liability under those leases assuming that the spaces cannot be sublet is approximately million 
our content and services may not achieve continued acceptance  which could adversely affect our profitability 
our future success depends upon our ability to deliver original and compelling content and services that attract and retain users 
the successful development and production of content and services is subject to numerous uncertainties  including the ability to anticipate and successfully respond to rapidly changing consumer tastes and preferences fund new program development attract and retain qualified editors  producers  writers  and technical personnel successfully anticipate the increased acceptance of methods other than personal computers to access the internet we cannot assure you that our content and services will be attractive to a sufficient number of users to generate revenues consistent with our estimates or sufficient to sustain operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will develop any new content or services in a timely or cost effective manner 
if we are unable to develop content and services that allow us to attract  retain and expand a loyal user base that is attractive to advertisers and sellers of technology products  we will be unable to generate revenue 
our paid services may not continue to achieve acceptance in the marketplace  which could adversely affect our prospects and financial results 
we have started to charge users to access certain content and services that have previously been free 
gamespot complete is one recent example where we charge subscribers a fee to access portions of the gamespot internet site 
another example is upload paid services  in which developers of software must pay a fee to list their products on our download 
com site 
we cannot offer any assurances that users will continue to pay for content services that have previously been free 
in addition  we may not be able to grow this business successfully if we cannot create new products and services that our users will be willing to pay us a fee to receive 
our inability to maintain or grow our paid offerings may adversely affect our financial condition 
we depend on arrangements with third parties for internet traffic to our sites and our failure to develop and maintain relationships with third parties could adversely affect our financial condition 
we rely on the cooperation of owners and operators of other internet sites with whom we have syndication and other arrangements to generate traffic for our internet sites 
our ability to maintain these relationships will continue to be critical to the success of our internet operations 
if we are unable to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with such third parties on acceptable commercial terms  or if our competitors are better able to capitalize on these relationships  our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we depend on advertising as a principal source of our revenue 
our financial results will be adversely affected if we fail to sustain advertising revenues 
our revenues are derived in large part from the sale of advertising and other fees  such as lead fees  from sellers of technology products on the internet 
we expect that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from these services 
most of our advertising contracts are subject to termination by the customer at any time on thirty days prior written notice 
we may have difficulty in obtaining performance from advertisers who have longer term contracts should they fail to honor their contracts 
a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from lead fees generated from our commerce internet sites 
if we are unable to attract qualified users for which merchants are willing to pay us lead fees  our financial condition may be adversely affected 
we earn fees when users visit the sites of our merchant partners to view products that are listed on our commerce internet sites 
there are currently many other businesses that offer similar services 
it is very easy for new businesses to begin operations in this space 
in addition  users may prefer to contact merchants directly rather than return to our commerce internet sites to make future purchases 
if we are unable to continue to attract users to our shopping services or to maintain the fees we charge merchants for sending users to their sites  then our financial condition may be adversely affected 
most of our agreements with merchants under which lead fees are earned are terminable by either party on ten to thirty days notice 
we depend on  and receive  a significant percentage of our revenue from a relatively small number of large advertisers 
one customer accounted for of our revenue in a relatively small number of advertisers contribute a significant percentage of our revenue 
our top one hundred advertisers contributed approximately of our us revenue in these advertising clients may not continue to use our services to the same extent  or at all  in the future 
gateway  inc accounted for of our revenue in  and there can be no assurances that we will either maintain this relationship with gateway or successfully develop replacement relationships with other advertisers in the event that gateway does not remain a customer 
a significant reduction in advertising by one or more of our largest advertisers could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and condition 
our advertising and other operating revenues may be subject to fluctuations  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
we believe that advertising sales on the internet  as well as in traditional media fluctuate significantly with economic cycles and during any calendar year  with spending being weighted towards the end of the year 
advertising expenditures represent the largest single component of our revenue 
fluctuations in advertising expenditures generally  or with respect to internet based advertising specifically  could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects and financial condition 
we may also experience fluctuations during the calendar year in connection with our lead based shopping services  which are weighted towards the end of the year and which may reflect trends in the retail industry 
inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 
our success depends to a large extent on the continued services of our senior management team 
our success is also dependent on our ability to identify  attract  retain and motivate other highly skilled officers  key employees and personnel in a very competitive job environment 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers and do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or other employees 
our ability to achieve our long term operating margin targets depends on our successful deployment of common data  information  ad delivery and commerce platforms 
in order to achieve improvements in our long term operating margins  we have undertaken a significant capital project to unify the data  information  ad delivery and commerce platforms throughout our internet network 
the cost of successfully completing this project may exceed our expectation 
in addition  the new platforms may not perform as expected  which could prevent us from reaching our long term operating margin targets 
we may have difficulties with our acquisitions and investments  which could adversely affect our growth and financial condition 
from time to time  we may consider new business opportunities and ventures  including acquisitions  in a broad range of areas 
any decision by us to pursue a significant business expansion or new business opportunity would be accompanied by risks  including  among others the investment of a substantial amount of capital  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to implement our existing business strategy the issuance of additional equity interests  which would be dilutive to current stockholders the additional  substantial burdens on our management personnel and financial and operational systems the difficulty of assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the combined companies the potential disruption of our ongoing business the possible inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel additional expenses associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets additional operating losses and expenses associated with the activities and expansion of acquired businesses the possible impairment of relationships with existing employees and advertising customers the potential undisclosed liabilities associated with acquired businesses we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any transaction intended to expand our business or that this type of transaction will be profitable 
there are a number of risks associated with international operations that could adversely affect our business 
we have wholly owned operations in england  france  germany  switzerland  singapore  japan and australia 
in addition  we have an international presence through joint ventures in china and korea 
we also have license arrangements in various other countries throughout the world 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets  such as the following weak economic conditions in foreign markets  especially in the technology sector uncertainty of product acceptance by different cultures unforeseen changes in regulatory requirements difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations currency exchange rate fluctuations difficulties in finding appropriate foreign licensees or joint venture partners potential adverse tax consequences there is a risk that such factors will have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully operate internationally and on our profits and liquidity 
changes in regulations could adversely affect the way that we operate 
it is possible that new laws and regulations in the us and elsewhere will be adopted covering issues affecting our business  including privacy copyrights  trademarks and domain names obscene or indecent communications pricing  characteristics and quality of internet products and services the ability of children to access our services taxation of internet usage and transactions increased government regulation  or the application of existing laws to online activities  could decrease the growth of the internet reduce our revenues increase our operating expenses expose us to significant liabilities any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our profits and liquidity 
we cannot be sure what effect any future material noncompliance by us with these laws and regulations or any material changes in these laws and regulations could have on our business 
we may be subject to system disruptions  which could adversely affect our revenues 
our ability to attract and maintain relationships with users  advertisers  merchants and strategic partners will depend on the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our internet channels and network infrastructure 
our internet advertising revenues relate directly to the number of advertisements and other marketing opportunities delivered to our users 
system interruptions or delays that result in the unavailability of internet channels or slower response times for users would reduce the number of advertisements and sales leads delivered to such users and reduce the attractiveness of our internet channels to users  strategic partners and advertisers or reduce the number of impressions delivered and thereby reduce revenue 
on two occasions in  we were obligated to suspend operation of significant portions of our sites as a result of moving our data centers 
we will continue to suffer future interruptions from time to time whether due to natural disasters  telecommunications failures  other system failures  maintenance  viruses  hacking or other events 
system interruptions or slower response times could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
our networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized persons accessing our systems  which could disrupt our operations and result in the theft of our proprietary information 
a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our internet operations 
we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches in security 
for example  so called spiders have and can be used in efforts to copy our databases  including our database of technology products and prices 
concerns over the security of internet transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet  particularly as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
our activities and the activities of third party contractors involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as computer software or credit card numbers 
accordingly  security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
we cannot assure you that contractual provisions attempting to limit our liability in these areas will be successful or enforceable  or that other parties will accept such contractual provisions as part of our agreements 
our business involves risks of liability claims for internet and print content or technology  which could result in significant costs 
as a publisher and a distributor of content through the internet and print publications  we may face potential liability for defamation negligence copyright  patent or trademark infringement other claims based on the nature and content of the materials published or distributed these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against online services and publishers of print publications 
in addition  we could be exposed to liability in connection with material indexed or offered on our internet sites or for information collected from and about our users 
for example  our download 
com directory includes listings for file sharing software that may be subject to challenge under copyright laws 
although we do not believe that our listing of any such software should expose us to liability  it is possible that such a claim may be successfully brought 
there has been a recent increase in the granting and attempted enforcement of business process patents that cover practices that may be widely employed in the internet industry 
if we are found to violate any such patent  and we are unable to enter into a license agreement on reasonable terms  our ability to offer services could be materially and adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that third parties or users will not bring claims against us relating to proprietary rights or use of personal information 
we do not have insurance for patent infringement 
our insurance may not cover potential claims of defamation  negligence and similar claims  and it may or may not apply to a particular claim or be adequate to reimburse us for all liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our financial condition may be impacted by certain contingencies 
as further described in item legal proceedings  we are a party to a trademark infringement suit filed against mysimon  inc  a subsidiary of cnet 
there is a possibility that we may be liable for damages as a result of this lawsuit  however  the extent of potential damages is unknown 
while we believe that our losses will be covered by insurance  our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted by a loss or an adverse settlement 
in addition  in conjunction with the zdnet acquisition  we assumed guarantee of the obligations of ziff davis media inc under a new york city office lease for a total of  square feet 
in connection with that guarantee  we also have a letter of credit for million outstanding as a security deposit 
this lease expires in the average cost per square foot is approximately thirty dollars over the remaining term of the lease 
we currently occupy  square feet of the office space covered under this lease 
ziff davis media inc currently occupies  square feet of this space 
there are two additional sublessees  the bank of new york and softbank  who collectively occupy a total of  square feet 
as of december   the total minimum lease payments remaining until the end of the lease term were million  excluding the amounts attributable to our sublease 
if the financial condition of any of the sublessees or the primary lessee were to deteriorate and thereby result in an inability to make their lease payments  we would be required to make additional lease payments under the guarantee  which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our financial condition 
at december  we had approximately million outstanding of convertible subordinated notes due we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt as described below make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  acquisitions or general corporate purposes limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business reduce funds available for use in our operations impair our ability to incur additional debt because of financial and other restrictive covenants make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or an increase in interest rates if we experience a decline in revenues due to any of the factors described in this risk factors section or otherwise  we could have difficulty paying interest and principal amounts due on our indebtedness 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments  or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness  we would be in default  which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause defaults under our other indebtedness 
any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
if we do not achieve and sustain positive net income  we could have difficulty repaying or refinancing our outstanding debt 
the price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuation 
the trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations  which are a result of a number of events and factors  including quarterly variations in operating results announcements of innovations requiring significant expenditures new products  strategic developments or business combinations by us or our competitors changes in our financial estimates or that of securities analysts changes in recommendations of securities analysts the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us news reports  including those relating to trends in the internet other events or factors in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
these fluctuations may make it more difficult to use stock as currency to make acquisitions that might otherwise be advantageous  or to use stock options as a means to attract and retain employees 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings compared to our or analysts or investors expectations could cause  and has in the past caused an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  we may not learn of such shortfalls or delays until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and greater decline in the trading price of our common stock 
we have a substantial number of shares of common stock that may be sold  which could affect the trading price of our common stock 
we have a substantial number of shares of common stock subject to stock options  and our notes may be converted into shares of our common stock 
in addition  as of december   we have over million shares of authorized but unissued shares of our common stock that are available for future sale 
as of december   we also had  options available to grant under our employee stock option plans 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of shares of our common stock  or the availability of shares of our common stock for future sale  will have on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  softbank  which owns approximately of our outstanding common stock  has a right  pursuant to registration rights granted under the stockholder agreement  to require us to register for public sale our common stock owned by softbank 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issued in connection with acquisitions  upon the exercise of stock options or warrants or the conversion of debt securities  or the perception that such sales could occur  may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay  prevent or make more difficult a merger  tender offer  proxy contest or change of control 
our stockholders might view any transaction of this type as being in their best interest since the transaction could result in a higher stock price than the current market price for our common stock 
among other things  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock with the terms of each series to be fixed by our board of directors divide our board of directors into three classes so that only approximately one third of the total number of directors is elected each year permit directors to be removed only for cause specify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations in addition  with some exceptions  the delaware general corporation law restricts or delays mergers and other business combinations between us and any stockholder that acquires or more of our voting stock 
ownership of our common stock will be concentrated in a small group of stockholders whose interests may differ from those of other stockholders 
forty three percent of our outstanding common stock is held by seven stockholders 
shelby w 
bonnie  our chairman and chief executive officer  holds of our outstanding common stock 
the concentration of ownership of our common stock may delay  prevent or deter a change in control  could deprive other stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of cnet or its assets and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
also  these stockholders can exert significant control over actions requiring the approval of a majority of the voting stock  including amendments to our charter 
commercial and other transactions between us  on the one hand  and the directors  officers and major stockholders of cnet and their affiliates  on the other  create potential for  or could result in  conflicting interests 
changes to accounting rules regarding goodwill could make our reported results less predictable 
in july  the financial accounting standards board changed accounting rules regarding the accounting for goodwill 
changes to these rules may have a significant impact on our reported financial results 
the new fasb standards relating to accounting for goodwill could make our acquisition related charges less predictable in any given reporting period 
statement of accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  establishes a new standard for accounting for goodwill acquired in a business combination 
it continues to require recognition of goodwill as an asset but does not permit amortization of goodwill as was required by accounting principles board opinion no 
 intangible assets 
under the new statement  goodwill is separately tested for impairment using a fair value based approach when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
the change from an amortization approach to an impairment approach will apply to previously recorded goodwill  as well as goodwill arising from acquisitions completed after the application of the new standard 
upon adoption of sfas  our goodwill amortization charges ceased 
as part of the transition provisions of sfas  we were required to review for impairment all previously recognized intangible assets that have been determined to have indefinite useful lives 
in no instance did the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceed its fair value as of january   and therefore  we determined that there was no impairment resulting from these transitions tests 
we performed our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment test as of august  the fair value of our reporting units was determined using a combination of the income and the market valuation approaches 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life 
under the market approach  the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
the results of this annual impairment test indicated the carrying value of goodwill for the us media reporting unit exceeded their implied fair values  and an impairment charge of million for goodwill was recorded in in the application of these valuation approaches  we were required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables 
actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates  including as a result of changes in the economy  the business in which we operate  and or own relative performance 
it is possible that we will incur less frequent  but larger  impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded as well as any goodwill arising out of future acquisitions 
accordingly  our future earnings may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a period to period basis 
potential changes to accounting rules regarding stock based compensation could adversely impact our reported results 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  which is an amendment of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas amends sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
this pronouncement  as well as  the fasb s commitment to bring about convergence of accounting standards with the international accounting standards board  which is currently proposing new standards on stock based payments  could indicate a movement by the fasb to make current voluntary reporting mandatory 
since we currently report stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method  should the fasb require companies to expense stock based compensation based on fair value measurements rather than allow voluntary reporting  this potential change could increase our future losses or reduce our future earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers that  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
investment risk we have invested in equity instruments of privately held  information technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method  as we do not have the ability to exert significant influence over the investee or their operations 
for these non quoted investments  our policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
we identify and record impairment losses on investments when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
foreign currency risk certain forecasted transactions and assets are exposed to foreign currency risk 
because we have operations overseas  the revenues and expenses associated with those operations are exposed to foreign currency risk 
any weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which those operations are conducted results in a decrease in our recorded revenues and an increase in our expenses 
we monitor our foreign currency exposures regularly to assess our risk and to determine if we should hedge our currency positions
