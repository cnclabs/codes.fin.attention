item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic protein based products for the treatment of human disease 
we have been involved in the discovery and development of therapeutic protein based products for over years  including years as a wholly owned 
table of contents subsidiary of novo nordisk  a danish pharmaceutical company 
during this time  we contributed to the discovery or development of five products currently marketed by other companies 
in august  we were acquired by and became a wholly owned subsidiary of novo nordisk 
from the date of our acquisition through december   we earned the majority of our revenues by conducting research and development activities for novo nordisk 
we were paid at a rate of of our research and development costs incurred in connection with all projects performed on behalf of novo nordisk pursuant to a funding agreement 
we had net income of million in and million in in anticipation of our separation from novo nordisk pursuant to a planned restructuring by novo nordisk  the funding agreement was terminated effective january  also effective january   novo nordisk contributed to us the rights inside the united states to certain intellectual property  including patents on products on which we currently generate royalty revenues 
concurrently  we purchased the rights outside the united states to this intellectual property from novo nordisk  paying them million in october in addition  in september  we assigned to novo nordisk patents and other rights relating to factor vii  including novoseven  and insulin analogues  including novorapid  for a one time payment of million  which was recorded as a capital contribution 
as a result of this transaction  effective september we no longer receive royalties on sales of factor vii and insulin analogues 
in november  novo nordisk effected the restructuring 
as part of the restructuring  we became an independent company in a transaction that included a million private placement of our series b preferred stock and the reduction of novo nordisk s ownership to approximately of our outstanding capital stock and less than of our outstanding voting stock 
at the same time  we granted novo nordisk an option to license certain rights to potential therapeutic proteins pursuant to an option agreement  including rights to a defined number of proteins outside of north america over a period of four years in return for option fees of million per year 
novo nordisk may elect to extend the option agreement for an additional two years in return for continuing option fees of million per year 
for each exercise of an option by novo nordisk  we will receive a license fee  the amount of which depends on the development stage of the protein licensed 
we are entitled to additional amounts upon the achievement of predefined milestones 
in addition  we will earn royalties on sales of any resulting products 
to date  novo nordisk has exercised options to license three proteins pursuant to this agreement 
in february  we completed our initial public offering 
upon the completion of the initial public offering  each share of series a and b preferred stock held by novo nordisk and other investors converted into shares of non voting and voting common stock  respectively 
in june  all shares of non voting common stock were converted into the same number of shares of voting common stock 
as of december   novo nordisk s ownership percentage was 
after termination of the funding agreement with novo nordisk  we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the accumulated deficit resulted from the net losses and certain capital transactions with novo nordisk 
we expect our net losses to increase in the future as we continue to expand our product development activities  including clinical trials  and build additional infrastructure 
our current revenue sources are limited  and we do not generate any direct revenues from product sales 
we earn royalties on sales of products by several licensees  including novo nordisk 
for the year ended december   revenues from royalties were million 
in the near term  we expect our revenues to consist primarily of product royalties  the option fees from novo nordisk and revenues generated under existing collaborative agreements with novo nordisk and serono sa as of december  we had deferred revenues aggregating million  of which million are expected to be recognized in additionally  we may generate revenues from the establishment of new collaborative research and development arrangements and license agreements 
ultimately  we intend to derive revenues from commercial product sales 
because a 
table of contents substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on the establishment of new agreements and the achievement of development related milestones  our results of operations could vary substantially from year to year 
we recognized revenues from our funding agreement with novo nordisk when costs were incurred on novo nordisk related projects 
we recognize revenues from royalties when amounts are due and considered collectible 
we recognize revenues from license fees  option fees and up front payments in connection with other rights or services that represent continuing obligations systematically over the period that the fees or payments are earned 
we recognize revenues from milestone payments representing completion of separate and substantive earnings processes when the milestone is achieved and amounts are due and payable 
these amounts are dependent on the completion of development related milestones  which may not be achieved 
our operating expenses consist of research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses and noncash stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses have been our most significant expenses to date and consist primarily of salaries and benefit expenses  costs of consumables  facility costs and contracted services 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefit expenses  professional fees and other corporate costs 
we expect our research and development and general and administrative expenses to increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our product development activities 
we expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in will be incurred in support of our internal product development programs for rfactor xiii  rhthrombin  taci ig and il it is not unusual for the clinical development of these types of products to take five years or more to complete  and to cost well over million per product candidate 
the time and cost of completing the clinical development of these product candidates will depend on a number of factors  including the disease or medical condition to be treated  clinical trial design and endpoints  availability of patients to participate in trials and the relative efficacy of the product versus treatments already approved 
due to these many uncertainties  we are unable to estimate the length of time or the costs that will be required to complete the development of these product candidates 
under our amended and restated stock incentive plan  stock options were granted in with exercise prices equal to the estimated fair value of the common stock at the date of grant 
in and early  prior to the completion of our initial public offering  stock options were granted to employees and directors at exercise prices below the estimated fair value of the common stock on the date of grant 
as a result  we recorded total deferred stock based compensation of million through december  deferred stock based compensation is being amortized to expense over the vesting periods of the underlying options  generally four years  using the straight line method 
we amortized noncash stock based compensation expense of million in  million in  and expect to amortize million in  million in and million in the amount of noncash stock based compensation expense expected to be recorded in future periods may decrease if unvested options for which deferred stock based compensation has been recorded are subsequently cancelled 
although we have no intention of doing so  the amount could increase if future options are granted with exercise prices below the estimated fair value of the common stock on the date of the grant 
other income expense consists primarily of interest income and interest expense 
interest income is generated primarily from investment of our cash reserves 
in addition  we earned million in interest from novo nordisk on a royalty payment received in march interest expense relates generally to periodic short term borrowings from novo nordisk  all of which occurred and were repaid in full prior to our separation from novo nordisk in november as a result of the sale leaseback transaction completed in october  we recorded a deferred gain of million  which will be recognized as other income on a straight line basis over the year initial lease term 
benefit provision for income taxes consists of income taxes computed at federal statutory rates less applicable credits 
subsequent to november   we have provided full valuation allowances for net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million  research and development tax credit carryforwards of million  a rehabilitation tax credit carryforward of 
table of contents million  and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million 
these credits will expire during the period from through on october   we entered into a tax sharing agreement related to our separation from novo nordisk 
this agreement requires that all research and development credit carryforwards generated prior to november  that we use to generate a tax benefit in future periods be reimbursed to novo nordisk  provided that the total reimbursement will not exceed million 
due to the uncertainty regarding the ultimate utilization of these tax benefits  a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire amount of the related net deferred tax assets 
as a result of our separation from novo nordisk in november  and the subsequent evolving nature of our business  we believe that certain period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased by million  from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to a one time license fee payment of million received in december  which resulted from the granting of a license to our ig fusion protein patents 
as a result of the agreement  the patent infringement lawsuit filed by us in march against immunex corporation now owned by amgen was terminated by all parties 
the revenue increase was also due to increased revenues from licensing arrangements and milestone payments based on the achievement of development related milestones 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in product royalties in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  exclusive of noncash stock based compensation expense of million in and million in  increased by million  from million in to million in a significant portion of the increase was due to increased expenses for contract manufacturing to support the development of two of our lead internal product candidates  rfactor xiii and rhthrombin 
additionally  an increase in personnel  primarily in areas supporting product development  resulted in an increase in salaries and related costs 
we anticipate that research and development expenses  particularly with respect to clinical trials  will increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to advance our internal development programs 
annual rent expense of million resulting from the sale leaseback transaction  of which the majority will be classified as research and development expense  will also contribute to future increases 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  exclusive of noncash stock based compensation expense of million in and million in  increased by million from million in to million in the increase reflects added administrative personnel  resulting in an increase in salaries and related costs  an increase in legal costs associated with the recently settled lawsuit with amgen  and increased expenses related to our operation as a public company 
additionally  our decision to postpone construction of a dedicated pilot manufacturing facility resulted in the write off of design and engineering costs totaling million in noncash stock based compensation expense 
noncash stock based compensation expense increased by million from million in to million in the increase resulted from the granting of options during the second half of and the beginning of with estimated fair values exceeding the exercise prices of the options 
other income expense 
other income expense increased by million from million in to million in the increase resulted from recognition of million of gain on the sale leaseback transaction 
although our average cash invested in was greater than in the comparable period in  the average interest rate earned on our investments in was lower than the average interest rate in 
table of contents benefit provision for income taxes 
the income tax benefit in of million represents the final payment according to the tax sharing agreement we entered into with novo nordisk prior to our separation 
no additional income tax benefit was recognized in either or due to the uncertainty of realization 
years ended december  and revenues 
revenues decreased by million  from million in to million in this decrease was attributable to a one time royalty payment of million from novo nordisk received in march  which was recorded as revenue in the first quarter of when the amount was determined and collectibility was probable 
additionally  million of novoseven royalties were earned in prior to the assignment of our related rights to novo nordisk 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the amount of option fee revenues earned under our agreement with novo nordisk 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  exclusive of noncash stock based compensation expense of million in  decreased by million  from million in to million in this decrease was due primarily to reduced expenses related to discovery research collaborations and database subscriptions 
we also introduced cost awareness programs related to consumables  resulting in decreases in spending 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with patenting activities and the addition of employees devoted to research and development 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  exclusive of noncash stock based compensation expense of million in  decreased by million from million in to million in this decrease was due primarily to changes in the value of outstanding novo nordisk stock appreciation rights previously granted to administrative personnel  which resulted in a decrease in compensation expense of million 
as of december   all of these rights had been exercised and none remained outstanding 
the decrease was also due to the termination of fees associated with administrative services provided by novo nordisk and a reduction in state and city taxes 
noncash stock based compensation expense 
noncash stock based compensation expense was million in  none was recorded in the expense resulted from the granting of stock options in with estimated fair values exceeding the exercise prices of the options 
other income expense 
other income expense increased by million from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to an increase in interest income from million in to million in the increase in interest income resulted from higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in  reflecting the net proceeds of million from the private equity financing completed in november the increase in other income was also due to a decrease in interest expense of million 
we incurred this interest on various loans from novo nordisk  which were fully repaid by the end of benefit provision for income taxes 
the income tax provision in was million  which reflects a valuation allowance for our cumulative net deferred tax assets partially offset by the benefit from our net operating loss for the period from january  through november   the date of separation from novo nordisk 
the income tax benefit in of million represents the final payment according to the tax sharing agreement we entered into with novo nordisk prior to our separation 
no additional income tax benefit was recognized in due to the uncertainty of realization 
liquidity and capital resources over the three years ended december   our operations were funded by proceeds of million from the assignment to novo nordisk of patents and other rights relating to novoseven and novorapid  
table of contents net proceeds of million from our november private equity financing  net proceeds of million from our initial public offering in february  net proceeds of million from the sale and leaseback transaction completed in october  revenues earned from royalties  option fees  license fees and milestone payments  and investment income 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  which increased from million as of december  our cash reserves are held in a variety of investment grade  fixed income securities  including corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market instruments 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in net cash used in operating activities in was higher than our net loss of million due to an income tax payment of million to novo nordisk partially offset by non cash reconciling items related to a deferred tax valuation allowance  depreciation and amortization expense  and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash used in operating activities for each of the years and was less than our net loss due to non cash items  such as depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense  and revenues received but deferred to future periods 
we expect to continue the trend of using cash to fund our operating activities in the future 
this use of cash is expected to increase over time as we expand our research and development activities and move product candidates into and through clinical trials 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in net cash used in investing activities in consisted primarily of capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities in included million for purchases of short term investments  net of proceeds from sales and maturities  and million for capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities in included million for purchases of short term investments  net of proceeds from sales and maturities  and million for capital expenditures  partially offset by the receipt of million of net proceeds from the completion of the sale leaseback transaction  which is described below 
in october  pursuant to an earlier commitment  we purchased the final parcel of land originally intended for the construction of a pilot manufacturing facility 
earlier in we decided to defer the construction of this facility to an undetermined date in the future 
the acquired land is being held for future expansion 
cash provided by financing activities was million in   in and million in financing activities in included the receipt of net proceeds of million from the private equity financing completed in november and the receipt of million for the assignment to novo nordisk of patents and other rights relating to factor vii and insulin analogues  offset by a payment of million to novo nordisk to purchase rights to certain intellectual property 
financing activities in included the net proceeds of million from the completion of our initial public offering and million of net proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
on october   we completed a sale and leaseback transaction involving our headquarter buildings located in seattle  washington 
the three buildings were sold for a total purchase price of million 
simultaneously  we agreed to lease the buildings from the purchaser for a period of years  subject to four five year renewal options 
net proceeds from this transaction amounted to million and a gain on the sale of million will be deferred and will be recognized ratably over the initial lease term 
the initial rental payment of million per year will increase by each year during the initial term 
we will recognize rent expense of million per year  which is the average annual rent over the initial lease term 
we have retained an option to expand one of the leased buildings 
planning is underway to pursue this option in if this expansion project is pursued  we expect the project to cost approximately million  including all related equipment costs 
the purchaser has agreed to finance a substantial portion of these costs 
to date  we have made no material financial commitments related to the facility expansion 

table of contents we expect to incur substantial costs as we continue to expand our research and development programs  particularly as we move product candidates into clinical trials 
we expect these expenditures to increase over the next several years 
our plans include the internal development of selected product candidates and the co development of product candidates with collaborators where we would assume a percentage of the overall product development costs 
we believe that our existing cash resources  including the net proceeds of million from the sale leaseback transaction completed in october  will provide sufficient funding to support our operations for at least the next three years 
if we are successful in completing additional collaborative development transactions  which would generate both revenues and cost reductions  we believe that our cash resources will fund our programs for at least four years 
if  at any time  our prospects for financing these programs decline  we may decide to reduce our ongoing investment in our development programs 
we could reduce our investment by discontinuing our funding under existing co development arrangements  establishing new co development arrangements for other product candidates to provide additional funding sources or out licensing product candidates that we might otherwise develop internally 
additionally  we could consider delaying or discontinuing development of product candidates to reduce the level of our related expenditures 
our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on several factors  many of which may not be in our control  including the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims  the results of research and development programs  cash flows under existing and potential future arrangements with licensees  collaborators and other parties  and the costs associated with the expansion of our facilities 
over the next several years we will need to seek additional funding through public or private financings  including equity financings  and through other arrangements  including collaborative arrangements 
poor financial results  unanticipated expenses or unanticipated opportunities that require financial commitments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect 
however  financing may be unavailable when we need it or may not be available on acceptable terms 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders would be reduced  and these securities could have rights superior to those of our common stock 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them  we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate expenditures for some of our development programs or expansion plans  or grant rights to third parties to develop and market product candidates that we would prefer to develop and market internally  with license terms that are not favorable to us 
contractual obligations we are contractually obligated to make payments as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years after years amounts in thousands operating leases operating lease terms range from one to fifteen years with certain renewal provisions at our option 

table of contents critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition to date  our revenue has been generated primarily from three different sources option fees  product royalties and license and milestone fees 
option fees novo nordisk has been granted an option to obtain an exclusive license to an unlimited number of proteins discovered after august that modulate insulin producing beta cells and for up to the greater of eight or of our protein candidates other than those related to beta cells over a period of four years beginning november  in return  we are entitled to receive four annual payments of million  the first of which was received in november novo nordisk may elect to extend the agreement for a period of two additional years  with the right to license up to four more protein candidates in return for continuing to pay us the million annual payments 
upon exercise of an option by novo nordisk  we will receive an up front license fee  the amount of which is dependent on the stage of the product candidate licensed 
additionally  novo nordisk will be obligated to make payments upon the achievement of predefined development milestones and to pay royalties on sales of resulting products 
each of the million option payments is being recognized ratably over the twelve months following receipt 
product royalties we earn royalties on several products marketed and sold by novo nordisk and other companies 
royalty reports are received within to days after the end of each quarter 
we record estimates at the end of each quarter based on historical sales information 
adjustments are made in the following quarter reflecting the difference between our estimate and actual reported royalties 
license and milestone fees we enter into various licensing agreements that generate up front payments with subsequent milestone payments earned based on the completion of development milestones 
we exercise our best judgment in determining the period over which we have continuing commitments to perform under the agreements 
revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over this period  which has ranged in duration from six months to ten years 
for certain license agreements  which require no performance on our part  license fee revenue has been recognized immediately upon execution of the agreement

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and short term and restricted investments in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including united states government and agency securities  high grade united states corporate bonds  asset backed securities  commercial paper and money market funds 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we do not have any foreign currency exposure  nor do we hold derivative financial instruments
