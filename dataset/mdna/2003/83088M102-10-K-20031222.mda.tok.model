overview skyworks solutions  inc skyworks or the company is a leading wireless semiconductor company focused exclusively on radio frequency rf and complete cellular system solutions for mobile communications applications 
we offer front end modules  rf subsystems and cellular systems to leading wireless handset and infrastructure customers 
on june   pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization  dated as of december   as amended as of april   by and among alpha industries  inc alpha  conexant systems  inc 
conexant and washington sub  inc washington  a wholly owned subsidiary of conexant to which conexant spun off its wireless communications business  including its gallium arsenide wafer fabrication facility located in newbury park  california  but excluding certain assets and liabilities  washington merged with and into alpha with alpha as the surviving entity the merger 
following the merger  alpha changed its corporate name to skyworks solutions  inc immediately following completion of the merger  the company purchased conexant s semiconductor assembly  module manufacturing and test facility located in mexicali  mexico  and certain related operations mexicali operations for million 
for financial accounting purposes  the sale of the mexicali operations by conexant to skyworks solutions was treated as if conexant had contributed the mexicali operations to washington as part of the spin off  and the million purchase price was treated as a return of capital to conexant 
for purposes of these financial statements  the washington business and the mexicali operations are collectively referred to as washington mexicali 
references to the company refer to washington mexicali for all periods prior to june   and to the combined company following the merger 
the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby washington was treated as the acquirer and alpha as the acquiree  primarily because conexant shareholders owned a majority  approximately percent  of the company upon completion of the merger 
under a reverse acquisition  the purchase price of alpha was based upon the fair market value of alpha common stock for a reasonable period of time before and after the announcement date of the merger and the fair value of alpha stock options 
the purchase price of alpha was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by washington  as the acquiring company for accounting purposes  based upon their estimated fair market value at the acquisition date 
because the historical financial statements of the company after the merger do not include the historical financial results of alpha for periods prior to june   the financial statements may not be indicative of future results of operations and are not indicative of the historical results that would have resulted if the merger had occurred at the beginning of a historical financial period 
we entered into agreements with conexant providing for the supply to us of transition services by conexant and for the supply of gallium arsenide wafer fabrication and assembly and test services to conexant  initially at substantially the same volumes as historically obtained by conexant from washington mexicali 
we also entered into agreements with conexant and jazz semiconductor  inc  a newport beach  california foundry joint venture between conexant and the carlyle group jazz semiconductor  providing for the supply to us of silicon based wafer fabrication  wafer probe and certain other services by jazz semiconductor 
historically  washington mexicali obtained a portion of its silicon based semiconductors from the newport beach wafer fabrication facility that is now jazz semiconductor 
we also provide semiconductor assembly and test services to conexant at our mexicali facility 
the wireless communications semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
our operating results have been  and our operating results may continue to be  negatively affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors  such as changes in demand for end user equipment  the timing of the receipt  reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis  availability and cost of products from suppliers  new product and technology introductions by competitors  changes in the mix of products produced and sold  intellectual property disputes  the timing and extent of product development costs and general economic conditions 
in the past  average selling prices of established products have generally declined over time and this trend is expected to continue in the future 
basis of presentation the financial statements prior to the merger were prepared using conexant s historical basis in the assets and liabilities and the historical operating results of washington mexicali during each respective period 
we believe the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable 
however  the financial information included herein and in our consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of the combined assets  liabilities  operating results and cash flows of the company in the future and is not indicative of what they would have been had washington mexicali been a separate stand alone entity and independent of conexant during the historical periods presented 
our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to september fiscal consisted of weeks and ended on october  and fiscal years and each consisted of weeks and ended on september  and september   respectively 
for convenience  the consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on the last day of the calendar month 
accordingly  references to september   and contained in this discussion refer to our actual fiscal year end 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
inventories we assess the recoverability of inventories through an on going review of inventory levels relative to sales backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycles 
when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand generally in excess of six months  we write down the value of those excess inventories 
we sell our products to communications equipment original equipment manufacturers oems that have designed our products into equipment such as cellular handsets 
these design wins are gained through a lengthy sales cycle  which includes providing technical support to the oem customer 
in the event of the loss of business from existing oem customers  we may be unable to secure new customers for our existing products without first achieving new design wins 
consequently  when the quantities of inventory on hand exceed forecasted demand from existing oem customers into whose products our products have been designed  we generally will be unable to sell our excess inventories to others  and the net realizable value of such inventories is generally estimated to be zero 
the amount of the write down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value generally zero 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets carrying values for long lived assets and definitive lived intangible assets  excluding goodwill  are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant in connection with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which was adopted on october  impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is determined using discounted cash flows 
carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed annually for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which was adopted on october  the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value 
in determining fair value  sfas no 
allows for the use of several valuation methodologies  although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner similar to purchase price allocation 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
deferred income taxes we have provided a valuation allowance related to our substantial united states deferred tax assets 
if sufficient evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions becomes apparent  we may be required to reduce our valuation allowance  which may result in income tax benefits in our statement of operations 
the future realization of certain tax deferred assets will be applied to reduce the carrying value of goodwill 
the portion of the valuation allowance for these deferred tax assets for which subsequently recognized tax benefits may be applied to reduce goodwill related to the purchase consideration of the merger is approximately million 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly 
in fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million related to the impairment of our mexicali assets 
a valuation allowance has not been established because we believe that the related deferred tax asset will be recovered during the carryforward period 
revenue recognition revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title  in accordance with the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer 
revenue recognition is deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete 
certain product sales are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for price protection and or a right of return on unsold products 
we reduce revenue to the extent of our estimate for distributor claims of price protection and or right of return on unsold product 
a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 
results of operations general net revenues increased million  or  in fiscal when compared to fiscal primarily as the result of increasing demand for our wireless product portfolio and the exclusion of alpha s revenues for periods prior to the merger 
since the merger  we have also expanded our customer base and geographical market presence resulting in higher revenues in fiscal gross margin improved in fiscal when compared to fiscal reflecting increased revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities 
in fiscal  we recorded special charges of million  principally related to the impairment of assets related to our infrastructure products and certain restructuring charges 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  october  and performed a transitional impairment test for goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value 
in determining fair value  sfas no 
allows for the use of several valuation methodologies  although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
as part of the first step  we determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of performing the fair value based test of goodwill 
this reporting unit is consistent with our single operating segment  which management determined is appropriate under the provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we completed step one and determined that our goodwill and unamortized intangible assets were impaired 
step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner similar to purchase price allocation 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
we completed step two and determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill was million greater than its implied fair value 
this transitional impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal in addition  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal and determined that as of july   our goodwill was not further impaired 
years ended september   and the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years below net revenues

revenues derived from customers located in the europe middle east africa region were  and of net revenues for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
our revenues by geography do not necessarily correlate to end handset demand by region 
for example  if we sell a power amplifier module to a customer in south korea  we record the sale within the south korea account although that customer  in turn  may integrate that module into a product sold to a service provider its customer in africa  china  europe  the middle east  the americas or within south korea 
the foregoing percentages are based on sales representing washington mexicali sales for fiscal and fiscal up to the time of the merger  and sales of the combined company for the post merger period from june  through the end of the fiscal year and for fiscal net revenues increased in fiscal when compared to fiscal primarily reflecting increasing demand for our wireless product portfolio and the exclusion of alpha s revenues for periods prior to the merger 
more specifically  gsm direct conversion transceivers and complete cellular systems as well as cdma rf subsystems exhibited strong year over year growth 
additionally  we have launched a number of more highly integrated product offerings  added to our customer base and expanded our geographical market presence 
these increases in net revenues in fiscal when compared to fiscal were tempered by a decrease in average selling prices of our front end module products and an industry wide component and handset inventory correction 
in addition  lower cdma handset subsidies in korea also adversely affected net revenues in fiscal when compared to fiscal in certain global markets  wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers  ultimately decreasing the cost of the handset to the customer 
net revenues increased in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  principally reflecting increased sales of gsm products  including power amplifier modules and complete cellular systems 
we also experienced increased demand for our power amplifier modules for cdma and tdma applications from a number of our key customers 
gross margin years ended september  in thousands gross margin    of net revenues gross margin represents net revenues less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with product manufacturing  royalty and other intellectual property costs and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to products sold 
cost of goods sold for the periods prior to the merger also includes allocations from conexant of manufacturing cost variances  process engineering and other manufacturing costs  which are not included in our unit costs but are expensed as incurred 
the improvement in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects increased revenues  improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities and a decrease in depreciation expense that resulted from the write down of our mexicali facility assets in the third quarter of fiscal although recent revenue growth has increased the level of utilization of our manufacturing facilities  these facilities continue to operate below optimal capacity and underutilization continues to adversely affect our unit cost of goods sold and gross margin 
gross margin in fiscal was also favorably affected by million when we reevaluated our obligation under a wafer fabrication supply agreement with conexant and jazz semiconductor and reduced our liability and cost of sales in the first quarter of fiscal pursuant to the terms of wafer supply agreements with conexant and jazz semiconductor  we are committed to obtain certain minimum wafer volumes from jazz semiconductor 
as of september   we expect to meet all of these purchase obligations 
our costs will be affected by the extent of our use of outside foundries and the pricing we are able to obtain 
during periods of high industry demand for wafer fabrication capacity  we may have to pay higher prices to secure wafer fabrication capacity 
the improvement in gross margin in fiscal  compared to fiscal  reflects increased revenues  improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities and a decrease in depreciation expense that resulted from the write down of the newbury park wafer fabrication assets in the third quarter of fiscal and the mexicali facility assets in the third quarter of the effect of the write down of the newbury park wafer fabrication assets and the mexicali facility assets on fiscal gross margin was approximately million and million  respectively 
gross margin for fiscal was adversely impacted by additional warranty costs of million 
the additional warranty costs were the result of an agreement with a major customer for the reimbursement of costs the customer incurred in connection with the failure of a product when used in a certain adverse environment 
although we developed and sold the product to the customer pursuant to mutually agreed upon specifications  the product experienced unusual failures when used in an environment in which the product had not been previously tested 
the product has since been modified and no significant additional costs are expected to be incurred in connection with this issue 
in addition  we originally estimated our obligation under our wafer supply agreement with conexant and jazz semiconductor  inc would result in excess costs of approximately million when recorded as a liability and charged to cost of sales in the third quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reevaluated this obligation and reduced our liability and cost of sales by approximately million in the quarter 
gross margin for the year ended september  benefited by approximately million as a result of the sale of inventories having a historical cost of million that were written down to a zero cost basis during fiscal year  such sales resulted from sharply increased demand beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal that was not anticipated at the time of the write downs 
gross margin for fiscal was adversely affected by inventory write downs of approximately million  partially offset by approximately million of subsequent sales of inventories written down to a zero cost basis 
the inventories that were written down to a zero cost basis in fiscal were either sold or scrapped during fiscal  and during fiscal  and  we sold million  million and million  respectively  and scrapped million  million and million  respectively 
as of september   we no longer held inventories which were written down to a zero cost basis in fiscal the inventory write downs recorded in fiscal resulted from the sharply reduced end customer demand we experienced  primarily associated with our rf components  as a result of the rapidly changing demand environment for digital cellular handsets during that period 
as a result of these market conditions  we experienced a significant number of order cancellations and a decline in the volume of new orders  beginning in the fiscal first quarter and becoming more pronounced in the second quarter 
research and development years ended september  change change in thousands research and development  
 
of net revenues research and development expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs  costs for pre production evaluation and testing of new devices and design and test tool costs 
research and development expenses for the periods prior to the merger also include allocated costs for shared research and development services provided by conexant  principally in the areas of advanced semiconductor process development  design automation and advanced package development  for the benefit of several of conexant s businesses 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal represents our commitment to design new products and processes and address new opportunities to meet our customers demands 
we have expanded customer support engagements as well as development efforts targeting semiconductor solutions using the cdma  gsm  general packet radio services  or gprs  and third generation  or g  wireless standards in both the digital cellular handset and infrastructure markets 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal when compared to the previous year is also related to our research and development expenses representing those of the combined company after the merger whereas those expenses in are representative of only washington mexicali prior to june  the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects the opening of a new design center in le mans  france and higher headcount and personnel related costs 
subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal  we expanded customer support engagements as well as development efforts targeting semiconductor solutions using the cdma  gsm  gprs  and g wireless standards in both the digital cellular handset and infrastructure markets 
selling  general and administrative years ended september  change change in thousands selling  general and administrative  
 of net revenues selling  general and administrative expenses include personnel costs legal  accounting  treasury  human resources  information systems  customer service  etc  sales representative commissions  advertising and other marketing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include allocated general and administrative expenses from conexant for the periods prior to the merger for a variety of these shared functions 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal when compared to fiscal is primarily related to our selling  general and administrative expenses representing those of the combined company after the merger whereas those expenses for the same period in are representative of only washington mexicali prior to june  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects lower headcount and personnel related costs resulting from the expense reduction and restructuring actions initiated during fiscal and lower provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable 
amortization of intangible assets years ended september  change change in thousands amortization of intangible assets  
 of net revenues in  we recorded million of intangible assets related to the merger consisting of developed technology  customer relationships and a trademark 
these assets are principally being amortized on a straight line basis over a year period 
amortization expense for fiscal primarily represents the amortization of these intangible assets 
amortization expense for fiscal and primarily represents amortization of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in connection with washington mexicali s acquisition of philsar semiconductor  inc philsar in fiscal philsar was a developer of rf semiconductor solutions for personal wireless connectivity  including emerging standards such as bluetooth  and rf components for third generation digital cellular handsets 
we wrote off all goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisition of the philsar bluetooth business in the third quarter of fiscal the lower amortization expense in fiscal when compared to fiscal and fiscal  primarily resulted from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on october  had the company ceased amortizing goodwill on october   amortization expense would have been million and million less in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on october  and performed a transitional impairment test for goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value 
in determining fair value  sfas no 
allows for the use of several valuation methodologies  although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
as part of the first step  we determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of performing the fair value based test of goodwill 
this reporting unit is consistent with our single operating segment  which management determined is appropriate under the provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we completed step one and determined that our goodwill and unamortized intangible assets were impaired 
step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner similar to purchase price allocation 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
we completed step two and determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill was million greater than its implied fair value 
this transitional impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal in addition  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal and determined that as of july   our goodwill was not further impaired 
purchased in process research and development years ended september  change change in thousands purchased in process research and development n a  n a in connection with the merger in fiscal  million was allocated to purchased in process research and development ipr d and expensed immediately upon completion of the acquisition as a charge not deductible for tax purposes because the technological feasibility of certain products under development had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
the charges represent the estimated fair values of the portion of ipr d projects that had been completed by alpha at the time of the merger 
prior to the merger  alpha was in the process of developing new technologies in its semiconductor and ceramics segments 
the objective of the ipr d effort was to develop new semiconductor processes  ceramic materials and related products to satisfy customer requirements in the wireless and broadband markets 
the semiconductor segment was involved in several projects that have been aggregated into the following categories based on the respective technologies power amplifier power amplifiers are designed and manufactured for use in different types of wireless handsets 
the main performance attributes of these amplifiers are efficiency  power output  operating voltage and distortion 
current research and development is focused on expanding the offering to all types of wireless standards  improving performance by process and circuit improvements and offering a higher level of integration 
control products control products consist of switches and switch filters that are used in wireless applications for signal routing 
most applications are in the handset market enabling multi mode  multi band handsets 
current research and development is focused on performance improvement and cost reduction by reducing chip size and increasing functionality 
broadband the products in this grouping consist of radio frequency rf and millimeter wave semiconductors and components designed and manufactured specifically to address the needs of high speed  wireline and wireless network access 
current and long term research and development is focused on performance enhancement of speed and bandwidth as well as cost reduction and integration 
silicon diode these products use silicon processes to fabricate diodes for use in a variety of rf and wireless applications 
current research and development is focused on reducing the size of the device  improving performance and reducing cost 
ceramics the ceramics segment was involved in projects that relate to the design and manufacture of ceramic based components such as resonators and filters for the wireless infrastructure market 
current research and development is focused on performance enhancements through improved formulations and electronic designs 
the material risks associated with the successful completion of the in process technology were associated with our ability to successfully finish the creation of viable prototypes and successful design of the chips  masks and manufacturing processes required 
we expected to benefit from the in process projects as the individual products that contained the in process technology were put into production and sold to end users 
the release dates for each of the products within the product families were varied 
the fair value of the ipr d was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  the fair value reflected the present value of the projected cash flows that were expected to be generated by the products incorporating the ipr d  if successful 
the projected cash flows were discounted to approximate fair value 
the discount rate applicable to the cash flows of each project reflected the stage of completion and other risks inherent in each project 
the weighted average discount rate used in the valuation of ipr d was percent 
as of september   the company had either completed or abandoned each of these projects 
the completed ipr d projects commenced generating cash flows in fiscal due to the nature of these projects and the related technolgy  the revenue streams derived from these projects cannot be separately identified 
special charges years ended september  change change in thousands special charges   asset impairments during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million charge for the impairment of assets related to certain infrastructure products manufactured in our woburn  massachusetts and adamstown  maryland facilities 
the woburn facility primarily manufactures semiconductor products based on both silicon wafer technology and gallium arsenide technology 
our adamstown  maryland facility primarily manufactures ceramics components 
we experienced a significant decline in factory utilization resulting from a downturn in the market for products manufactured at these two facilities and a decision to discontinue certain products 
the impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management based on these factors and the related impact on our current and projected outlook 
we projected lower revenues and new order volume for these products and management believed these factors indicated that the carrying value of the related assets machinery  equipment and intangible assets may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed 
in performing the analysis for recoverability  management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from these products over a five year period 
since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets  it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value 
the fair value of the assets was determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of  which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the projected future cash flows 
management believes the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets 
the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets 
the anticipated pre tax cost savings related to these impairment charges is expected to be million over the next five years fiscal through fiscal and million over the subsequent fifteen years fiscal through 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million charge for the impairment of our haverhill  massachusetts property that is currently being held for sale 
in fiscal  we relocated our operations from this facility to our woburn  massachusetts facility 
we are actively marketing the property located in haverhill  massachusetts 
during fiscal  the company recorded a million charge for the impairment of the assembly and test machinery and equipment and related facility in mexicali  mexico 
the impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management as a result of a significant downturn in the market for test and assembly services for non wireless products and the related impact on our current and projected outlook 
we experienced a severe decline in factory utilization at our mexicali facility for non wireless products and projected decreasing revenues and new order volume 
management believed these factors indicated that the carrying value of the assembly and test machinery and equipment and related facility may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed 
in performing the analysis for recoverability  management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from the manufacturing activities at the mexicali facility over a ten year period 
the estimated future cash flows were based on a gradual phase out of services sold to conexant and modest volume increases consistent with management s view of the outlook for the business  partially offset by declining average selling prices 
the declines in average selling prices were consistent with historical trends and management s decision to reduce capital expenditures for future capacity expansion 
since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value approximately million based on historical cost of the related assets  it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized 
the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value 
the fair value of the assets was determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of  which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the projected future cash flows 
management believes the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets 
the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets 
during fiscal  we recorded a million charge for the write off of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisition of philsar in fiscal management determined that we would not support the technology associated with the philsar bluetooth business 
accordingly  this product line was discontinued and the employees associated with the product line were either severed or relocated to other operations 
as a result of the actions taken  management determined that the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the philsar acquisition were impaired 
during the third quarter of fiscal we recorded an million charge for the impairment of our manufacturing facility and related wafer fabrication machinery and equipment at our newbury park  california facility 
this impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management as a result of the dramatic downturn in the market for wireless communications products and the related impact on our then current and projected business outlook 
through the third quarter of fiscal  we experienced a severe decline in factory utilization at the newbury park wafer fabrication facility and decreasing revenues  backlog  and new order volume 
management believed these factors  together with its decision to significantly reduce future capital expenditures for advanced process technologies and capacity beyond the then current levels  indicated that the value of the newbury park facility may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed 
in performing the analysis for recoverability  management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from the manufacturing activities at the newbury park facility over a ten year period 
the estimated future cash flows were based on modest volume increases consistent with management s view of the outlook for the industry  partially offset by declining average selling prices 
the declines in average selling prices were consistent with historical trends and management s decision to focus on existing products based on the current technology 
since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value approximately million based on historical cost of the related assets  it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized 
the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value 
the fair value of the assets was determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of  which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the projected cash flows 
we believe the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets 
the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets 
restructuring charges during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  we recorded million and million  respectively  in restructuring charges to provide for workforce reductions and the consolidation of facilities 
the charges were based upon estimates of the cost of severance benefits for affected employees and lease cancellation  facility sales  and other costs related to the consolidation of facilities 
substantially all amounts accrued for these actions are expected to be paid within one year 
during fiscal  we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives to more closely align our cost structure with the then current business environment 
we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million for costs related to the workforce reduction and the consolidation of certain facilities 
substantially all amounts accrued for these actions have been paid 
during fiscal  washington mexicali reduced its workforce by approximately employees  including approximately employees in manufacturing operations 
restructuring charges of million were recorded for such actions and were based upon estimates of the cost of severance benefits for the affected employees 
we have paid all amounts accrued for these actions 
activity and liability balances related to the fiscal and fiscal restructuring actions are as follows in thousands fiscal workforce reductions fiscal facility closings and other fiscal workforce reductions fiscal facility closings and other total charged to costs and expenses  cash payments   restructuring balance  september  charged to costs and expenses    cash payments    restructuring balance  september   in addition  we assumed approximately million of restructuring reserves from alpha in connection with the merger

we may redeem the junior notes at any time after november  the redemption price of the junior notes during the period between november  through november  will be  per  principal amount of notes to be redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the redemption date  and the redemption price of the notes beginning on november  and thereafter will be  per  principal amount of notes to be redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the redemption date 
holders may require that we repurchase the junior notes upon a change in control of the company 
we pay interest in cash semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year 
in addition  our long term debt includes million of convertible senior subordinated notes at a fixed rate of percent due june   which were issued as part of our debt refinancing with conexant completed on november  these senior notes can be converted into our common stock at a conversion rate based on the applicable conversion price  which is subject to adjustment based on  among other things  the market price of our common stock 
based on this adjustable conversion price  we expect that the maximum number of shares that could be issued under the senior notes is approximately million shares  subject to adjustment for stock splits and other similar dilutive occurrences 
if the holder s of these senior notes converted the notes at a price that is less than the original conversion price as the result of a decrease in the market price of our stock  we would be required to record a charge to interest expense in the period of conversion 
at maturity including upon certain acceleration events  we will pay the principal amount of the senior notes by issuing a number of shares of common stock equal to the principal amount of the senior notes then due and payable divided by the applicable conversion price in effect on such date  together with cash in lieu of any fractional shares 
we may redeem the senior notes at any time after may  at  per  principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the holder s may require that we repurchase the senior notes upon a change in control of the company 
we pay interest in cash on the senior notes on the last business day of each march  june  september and december of each year 
interest on the senior notes is not deductible for tax purposes because of the conversion feature 
we entered into a receivables purchase agreement under which we have agreed to sell from time to time certain of our accounts receivable to skyworks usa  inc skyworks usa  a wholly owned  special purpose entity that is fully consolidated for accounting purposes 
concurrently  skyworks usa entered into an agreement with wachovia bank  national association providing for a million credit facility facility agreement secured by the purchased accounts receivable 
our short term debt consists primarily of funds borrowed under the facility agreement 
as a part of the consolidation  any interest incurred by skyworks usa related to monies it borrows under the facility agreement is recorded as interest expense in our results of operations 
interest related to the facility agreement is libor plus and was approximately at september  we perform collections and administrative functions on behalf of skyworks usa 
as of september   skyworks usa had borrowed million under this agreement 
in addition  our short term debt includes the remaining portion of a ten year  loan from the state of maryland under the community development block grant program due december at an interest rate of percent

consequently  no united states income tax benefit has been recognized relating to the us operating losses 
as of september   we have established a valuation allowance against all of our net us deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets have been recognized for foreign operations when management believes they will be recovered during the carry forward period 
the provision benefit for income taxes for fiscal  and consists of foreign income taxes incurred by foreign operations 
we do not expect to recognize any income tax benefits relating to future operating losses generated in the united states until management determines that such benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
in  the provision for foreign income taxes was offset by a tax benefit of approximately million related to the impairment of our mexicali assets 
no provision has been made for united states  state  or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently reinvested 
it is not practical to determine the united states federal income tax liability  if any  which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on october   and performed a transitional impairment test for goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value 
in determining fair value  sfas no 
allows for the use of several valuation methodologies  although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
as part of the first step  we determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of performing the fair value based test of goodwill 
this reporting unit is consistent with our single operating segment  which management determined is appropriate under the provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we completed step one and determined that our goodwill and unamortized intangible assets were impaired 
step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
we completed step two and determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill was million greater than its implied fair value 
this transitional impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal in addition  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal and determined that as of july   our goodwill was not further impaired 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands years ended september  cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period   net cash provided by used in operating activities   net cash provided by used in investing activities   net cash provided by used in financing activities   cash and cash equivalents at end of period   cash and cash equivalents at september   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
working capital at september  was approximately million compared to million at september  and million at september  inventory turns were approximately for fiscal cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal  reflecting a net loss of million  offset by non cash charges primarily asset impairments  depreciation and amortization of million and a net decrease in working capital items of approximately million  including million of merger related expense payments 
as of september   substantially all amounts accrued for merger related expenses have been paid 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on october  and recorded a million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  representing the difference between the implied fair value and carrying value of our goodwill 
operating results in fiscal improved when compared to fiscal  primarily as the result of increased revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal primarily consisted of capital expenditures of million 
the capital expenditures for fiscal represent our continued investment in production and test facilities in addition to our commitment to invest in the capital needed to design new products and processes and address new opportunities to meet our customers demands 
we believe a focused program of capital expenditures will be required to sustain our current manufacturing capabilities 
we may also consider acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal also included million of purchases of short term investments 
our short term investments are classified as held to maturity and consist primarily of commercial paper with original maturities of more than days and less than twelve months 
on august  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec with respect to the issuance of up to million aggregate principal amount of securities  including debt securities  common or preferred shares  warrants or any combination thereof 
this registration statement  which the sec declared effective on august   provides us with greater flexibility and access to capital 
on september  we issued million shares of common stock under our shelf registration statement 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal included approximately million of net proceeds from this offering 
we may from time to time issue securities under the remaining balance of the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal also included the net impact of our private placement of million of percent convertible subordinated notes due and related debt refinancing with conexant on november  these subordinated notes can be converted into shares of common stock per  principal balance  which is the equivalent of a conversion price of approximately per share 
the net proceeds from the note offering were principally used to prepay million of the million debt to conexant relating to the purchase of the mexicali operations and prepay the million principal amount outstanding as of november  under a separate loan facility with conexant 
in connection with our prepayment of million of the million debt owed to conexant relating to the purchase of the mexicali operations  the remaining million principal balance was exchanged for new percent convertible senior subordinated notes with a maturity date of june  these senior subordinated notes can be converted into our common stock at a conversion rate based on the applicable conversion price  which is subject to adjustment based on  among other things  the market price of our common stock 
based on this adjustable conversion price  we expect that the maximum number of shares that could be issued under the senior subordinated notes is approximately million shares  subject to adjustment for stock splits and other similar dilutive occurrences 
in addition to the retirement of million in principal amount of indebtedness owing to conexant  we also retained approximately million of net proceeds of the private placement to support our working capital needs 
in addition  as of september   skyworks usa had borrowed million under our million facility agreement secured by the purchased accounts receivable with wachovia bank  national association 
cash used in operating activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
operating cash flows for fiscal and reflect net losses of million and million  respectively  offset by non cash charges depreciation and amortization  asset impairments and an in process research and development charge of million and million  respectively  and a net increase in working capital of approximately million and a net decrease of million  respectively 
during we consolidated facilities  reduced our work force and continued to implement cost saving initiatives 
in addition  increased revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities contributed to improved operating results in fiscal when compared to fiscal cash provided by investing activities for fiscal consisted of capital expenditures of million and dividends to conexant of million offset by cash received of million as a result of the merger and million from the sale of short term investments acquired in the merger 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal consisted of capital expenditures of million 
the capital expenditures for fiscal reflect a significant reduction from annual capital expenditures in fiscal  a key component of the cost reduction initiatives implemented in fiscal cash provided by financing activities consisted of net transfers from conexant  pre merger  of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal also consisted of million of proceeds from borrowings against the revolving credit facility with conexant 
historically  conexant managed cash on a centralized basis 
cash receipts associated with washington mexicali s business were generally collected by conexant  and conexant generally made disbursements on behalf of washington mexicali 
following is a summary of our contractual payment obligations for consolidated debt  purchase agreements and operating leases at september  see 
notes and 
of the consolidated financial statements  in thousands obligation total years years thereafter debt    purchase obligations   operating leases     under supply agreements entered into with conexant and jazz semiconductor  we receive wafer fabrication  wafer probe and certain other services from jazz semiconductor 
pursuant to these supply agreements  we are committed to obtain certain minimum wafer volumes from jazz semiconductor 
our expected minimum purchase obligations under these supply agreements are anticipated to be approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
based on our fiscal results of operations and current trends  and after giving effect to the net proceeds we received in our private placement of percent convertible subordinated notes due  our debt refinancing with conexant  our common stock public offering and our facility agreement  we expect our existing sources of liquidity  together with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our research and development  capital expenditures  debt obligations  purchase obligations  working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months

certain business risks we operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry  which is subject to significant downturns 
from time to time changes in general economic conditions  together with other factors  cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry 
periods of industry downturn  as we experienced beginning in calendar year  have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
these characteristics  and in particular their impact on the level of demand for digital cellular handsets  may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations 
during the late s and extending into  the wireless communications semiconductor industry enjoyed unprecedented growth  benefiting from the rapid expansion of wireless communication services worldwide and increased demand for digital cellular handsets 
however  beginning in calendar year  we were adversely impacted by a global economic slowdown and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the end user products that incorporate our products and system solutions  particularly cellular handsets 
the impact of weakened end customer demand was compounded by higher than normal levels of inventories among our original equipment manufacturer  or oem  subcontractor and distributor customers 
should the reduced end customer demand continue  this could result in underutilization of our manufacturing capacity  changes in revenue mix and other impacts that would continue to materially and adversely affect our operating results 
because of the cyclical nature of the wireless communications semiconductor industry  we cannot assure you of the timing  duration or magnitude of any recovery in our industry or that a recovery will occur 
we cannot assure you that the wireless communications semiconductor industry will not experience renewed  and possibly more severe and prolonged  downturns in the future  or that our operating results or financial condition will not be adversely affected by them 
we have experienced these cyclical fluctuations in our business and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the future 
we have recently incurred substantial operating losses and may experience future losses 
our operating results have been adversely affected by a global economic slowdown  concerns about inflation  decreased consumer confidence  reduced capital spending  adverse business conditions  and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and related industries 
these factors have lead to an to a slowdown in customer orders  an increase in the number of cancellations and reschedulings of backlog  higher overhead costs as a percentage of our reduced net revenue  and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the end user products that incorporate wireless communications semiconductor products and system solutions 
as a result  we continued to incur operating losses during fiscal and may experience operating losses in the future 
should the reduced end customer demand continue for any reason  this could result in underutilization of our manufacturing capacity  reduced revenues or changes in our revenue mix  and other factors that could continue to materially and adversely affect our operating results in the near term 
due to these economic factors  we cannot assure you as to whether or when we will become profitable or whether we will be able to sustain such profitability  if achieved 
additionally  the conflict in iraq as well as other contemporary international conflicts  acts of terrorism and civil and military unrest have augmented the economic slowdown 
these continuing and potentially escalating conflicts can be expected to place further pressure on economic conditions in the united states and worldwide 
these conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
if such conditions continue or worsen  our business  financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 
the wireless semiconductor markets are characterized by intense competition 
the wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we compete in particular are intensely competitive 
we compete with us and international semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share 
we currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue 
this competition has resulted in  and is expected to continue to result in  declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share 
furthermore  additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics  the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes 
we believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include  among others time to market  timely new product innovation  product quality  reliability and performance  product price  features available in products  compliance with industry standards  strategic relationships with customers  and access to and protection of intellectual property 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these factors 
many of our competitors enjoy the benefit of long presence in key markets  name recognition  high levels of customer satisfaction  ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property  and strong financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical or other resources 
as a result  certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers  resellers or other third parties 
these relationships may affect customers purchasing decisions 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner 
the wireless communications semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product evolution  price erosion  evolving technical standards  short product life cycles  increasing demand for higher levels of integration and increased miniaturization  and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
in particular  the markets into which we sell demand cutting edge technologies and new and innovative products 
our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis 
the development and commercialization of semiconductor devices  modules and system solutions is highly complex 
successful product development and introduction depends on numerous factors  including the ability to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards  the ability to obtain capacity sufficient to meet customer demand  the ability to define new products that meet customer and market requirements  the ability to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis  the ability to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors  overall market acceptance of our products  and the ability to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the substantial investment in research and development needed to develop and bring to market new and enhanced products in a timely manner 
we will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost effective manner  that our products will satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties to which our products interface 
in addition  prices of products may decline  sometimes significantly  over time 
we believe that to remain competitive we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce the cost of our products to remain competitive 
the markets into which we sell our products are characterized by rapid technological change 
the demand for our products can change quickly and in ways we may not anticipate 
our markets generally exhibit the following characteristics rapid technological developments and product evolution  rapid changes in customer requirements  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  demand for higher levels of integration  decreased size and decreased power consumption  short product life cycles with declining prices over the life cycle of the product  and evolving industry standards 
these changes in our markets may contribute to the obsolescence of our products 
our products could become obsolete or less competitive sooner than anticipated because of a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the above noted factors 
the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products is critical to our success 
as the source of our technological and product innovations  our key technical personnel represent a significant asset 
our success depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel 
the competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry  and we therefore cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products 
we may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance  given  among other things  the use of equity based compensation by us and our competitors 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business 
if oems and odms of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment  we will have difficulty selling those products 
moreover  a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer our products will not be sold directly to the end user but will be components or subsystems of other products 
as a result  we will rely on oems and odms of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment 
without these design wins  we would have difficulty selling our products 
if a manufacturer designs another supplier s product into one of its product platforms  it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost  time  effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer 
also  achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer 
even after a design win  the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products  for example  if its own products are not commercially successful  or for any other reason 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales 
lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in significant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products 
after our product is has been developed  tested  and manufactured  our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate  test and evaluate our products and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment incorporates the products 
this lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans  which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer 
as a result of this lengthy sales cycle  we may incur significant research and development expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses  before we generate the related revenues for these products 
furthermore  we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans 
uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could adversely affect our business 
our sales will typically be made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long term supply arrangements with our customers 
our customers may cancel orders before shipment 
additionally  we will sell a portion of our products through distributors  some of whom will have rights to return unsold products 
we may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products  which is difficult to predict 
this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers  or both  as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties 
in addition  our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason 
the cancellation or deferral of product orders  the return of previously sold products  or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes  could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory  which could result in inventory write downs and  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
a significant portion of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers 
if we lost one or more of these major customers  or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders of our products  our business would be materially and adversely affected 
sales to samsung electronics co 
and to motorola  inc represented approximately and  respectively  of net revenues for fiscal our future operating results will depend on the success of these customers and other customers and our success in selling products to them 
average product life cycles in the semiconductor industry tend to be very short 
in the semiconductor industry  product life cycles tend to be short relative to the sales and development cycles 
therefore  the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue  and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory 
if we were to incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory that we are not able to recover  and we are not able to compensate for those expenses  our operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory  our operating results would be harmed 
our leverage and our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
on september   after giving effect to unused availability under our receivable financing credit facility with wachovia bank  national association  we would have had total indebtedness of approximately million  which would have represented approximately of our total capitalization 
as long as our percent convertible subordinated notes remain outstanding  we will have debt service obligations on such notes of approximately  per year in interest payments 
in addition  we will have debt service obligations on our percent convertible senior subordinated notes due june   originally issued to conexant  of approximately  per year 
if we issue other debt securities in the future  our debt service obligations will increase 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and must instead use our existing cash or investments  we may have to reduce or curtail other activities of our business 
we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations  if any  and from our existing cash and investments 
if necessary  among other alternatives  we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and we may obtain other long term debt  lines of credit and other financing 
our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 
despite our current debt levels  we are able to incur substantially more debt  which would increase the risks described above 
we face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it 
we will need to obtain sources of financing in the future 
after giving effect to the net proceeds of our million offering on or about september   our million private placement of percent convertible subordinated notes due  our million debt refinancing with conexant and our receivables financing credit facility with wachovia bank  national association  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  together with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our research and development  capital expenditure  working capital and other financing requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future 
conditions existing in the us capital markets when we seek financing as well as the then current condition of the company will affect our ability to raise capital  as well as the terms of any financing 
we may not be able to raise enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all 
failure to obtain capital when required would have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources 
we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions will be available in the future 
our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized 
our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption  including for causes beyond our control 
the fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps 
it requires production in a highly controlled  clean environment 
minor impurities  contamination of the clean room environment  errors in any step of the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  defects in equipment or materials  human error  or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to malfunction 
because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields  these factors present could have a material adverse affect on our business 
in addition  we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped  which may require us to replace such products 
additionally  our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors 
these disruptions may include electrical power outages  fire  earthquake  flooding  war  acts of terrorism  or other natural or man made disasters 
disruptions of our manufacturing operations could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor 
in the event of such delays  we cannot assure you that the required alternative capacity  particularly wafer production capacity  would be available on a timely basis or at all 
even if alternative wafer production or assembly and test capacity is available  we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms  which could result in higher costs and or a loss of customers 
we may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand  either at our own facilities or through external manufacturing or similar arrangements with others 
due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process  in the event of a disruption at the newbury park  california or woburn  massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities  alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from third party sources 
these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability 
minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss  and in some cases  cause production to be suspended 
manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing  and typically increase as we bring the product to full production 
our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and  as a result  material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability 
the difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products 
our manufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles  which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without  in many cases  reaching the longer term  high volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs 
we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture  assembly and test of our products 
we rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities  called foundries  to provide silicon based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity 
we also utilize subcontractors to package  assemble and test our products 
there are significant risks associated with reliance on third party foundries  including the lack of ensured wafer supply  potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices  limited control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  production costs and quality assurance  and the inaccessibility of  or delays in obtaining access to  key process technologies 
although we have long term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity  the third party foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers 
if we choose to use a new foundry  it will typically take an extended period of time to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping products from the new foundry 
the foundries may experience financial difficulties  be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities  particularly since some of them are located in earthquake zones 
if any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs  we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available 
we may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products  which could impair our ability to meet our customers needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components 
our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and the components used in our manufacturing processes 
we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world 
while we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials  we are currently dependent on a sole source supplier for epitaxial wafers used in the gallium arsenide semiconductor manufacturing processes at our manufacturing facilities 
we cannot assure you that we will not lose a significant or sole supplier or that a supplier will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules 
if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications or delivery schedules  our ability to satisfy customer obligations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis 
in connection with our ongoing review  we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers 
we may also enter into other sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs 
if we were to enter into an additional sole supplier arrangement for any of our raw materials or components  the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated 
under supply agreements entered into with conexant and jazz semiconductor  inc we receive wafer fabrication  wafer probe and certain other services from jazz semiconductor 
pursuant to these supply agreements  we are committed to obtaining certain minimum wafer volumes from jazz semiconductor 
our expected minimum purchase obligations under these supply agreements are anticipated to be approximately million and million  respectively  in fiscal and remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration 
in order to remain competitive  we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries 
this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products  design new products to more stringent standards  and to redesign some existing products 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes  which resulted in sub optimal manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future 
in some instances  we depend on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our foundry relationships 
if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
however  we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  or at all 
we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally 
historically  a substantial majority of the company s net revenues from customers other than conexant were derived from customers located outside the united states  primarily countries located in the asia pacific region and europe 
in addition  we have design centers and suppliers located outside the united states  and third party packaging  assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the asia pacific region 
finally  we have our own packaging  assembly and test facility in mexicali  mexico 
our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad 
these include  but are not limited to  risks regarding currency exchange rate fluctuations  local economic and political conditions  including social  economic and political instability  disruptions of capital and trading markets  restrictive governmental actions such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures  including export duties  quotas  customs duties  import or export controls and tariffs  changes in legal or regulatory requirements  natural disasters  acts of terrorism  widespread illness and war  limitations on the repatriation of funds  difficulty in obtaining distribution and support  cultural differences in the conduct of business  the laws and policies of the united states and other countries affecting trade  foreign investment and loans  and import or export licensing requirements  tax laws  the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction  and limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction 
additionally  we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers 
increases in handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors  which could impact the demand for our products 
limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in south korea  japan  china and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues 
our operating results may be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns 
our revenues  earnings and other operating results have fluctuated in the past and our revenues  earnings and other operating results may fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations are due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  among others changes in end user demand for the products principally digital cellular handsets manufactured and sold by our customers  the effects of competitive pricing pressures  including decreases in average selling prices of our products  production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields  availability and cost of products from our suppliers  the gain or loss of significant customers  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis  new product and technology introductions by competitors  changes in the mix of products produced and sold  market acceptance of our products and our customers  intellectual property disputes  the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast  and these  as well as other factors  could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results 
if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors  it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock 
global economic conditions that impact the wireless communications industry could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 
global economic weakness can have wide ranging effects on markets that we serve  particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and network operators 
the wireless communications industry appears to be recovering from an industry wide recession 
we cannot predict whether a recovery will continue  the rate of any such recovery  or what effects negative events  such as war  may have on the economy or the wireless communications industry 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruptions to the global economy and to the wireless communications industry and create further uncertainties 
further  an economic recovery may not benefit us in the near term 
if it does not  our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired 
our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives 
among our product portfolio  we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and components  principally power amplifiers and switches 
the production of gallium arsenide integrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits 
the cost differential is due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes 
therefore  to remain competitive we must offer gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their silicon based counterparts 
if we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost differential  our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
we expect the costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing their silicon counterparts 
silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologies for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and markets that require performance attributes of gallium arsenide solutions 
we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights  or demands that we license third party technology  which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
from time to time  third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it 
at the present time  we are in discussions with qualcomm incorporated regarding claims each of us have filed and served against the other asserting violations of certain of our respective intellectual property rights 
the purpose of these discussions is to arrive at a business resolution that avoids protracted litigation for both parties 
we believe their claims are without merit and if we are not successful resolving this matter outside of litigation  we are prepared to vigorously defend against their claims and fully prosecute our claims against them 
any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another  including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our customers  regardless of their merit or resolution  could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
regardless of the merits of any specific claim  we cannot assure you that we would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation 
if litigation were to result in an adverse ruling  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  import  use  sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes  discontinue the use of infringing technology  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  and license technology from the third party claiming infringement  which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
we cannot assure you that our operating results or financial condition will not be adversely affected if we were required to do any one or more of the foregoing items 
many of our products incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties 
we sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration 
our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain in a competitive posture 
if licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions  and we cannot otherwise integrate such technology  our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete  and we could lose market share 
in such instances  we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products 
if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights  it may harm our ability to compete 
we rely on patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property laws  as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies  information  data  devices  algorithms and processes 
in addition  we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers  suppliers or other third parties into our designs  and we have obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of such third party intellectual property 
in the future  it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
this could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations 
we cannot assure you that the steps we take to prevent misappropriation  infringement  dilution or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers  suppliers or other third parties will be successful  any existing or future patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets or other intellectual property rights or ours will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or any of the measures described above would provide meaningful protection 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
if any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology  it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products  potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to effect suitable investments  alliances and acquisitions  and to integrate companies we acquire  and on our continued success integrating the wireless business of conexant with the company 
although we intend to invest significant resources in internal research and development activities  the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own 
on an ongoing basis  we intend to review investment  alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings  augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment  alliance or acquisition transactions in the future 
moreover  if we consummate such transactions  they could result in issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders  large one time write offs  the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities  the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company  amortization expenses related to intangible assets  and the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
moreover  integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult  expensive  time consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful 
additionally  in periods following an acquisition  we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets for impairment 
when such assets are found to be impaired  they will be written down to estimated fair value  with a charge against earnings 
for instance  we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal in the amount of million as a result of the goodwill obtained in connection with the merger 
we may be responsible for payment of a substantial amount of us federal income and other taxes upon certain events 
in connection with conexant s spin off of its wireless business prior to the merger  conexant sought and received a ruling from the internal revenue service to the effect that certain transactions related to and including the spin off qualified as a reorganization and as tax free for us federal income tax purposes 
while the tax ruling generally is binding on the internal revenue service  the continuing validity of the ruling is subject to certain factual representations and assumptions 
in connection with the merger we entered into a tax allocation agreement with conexant that generally provides  among other things  that we will be responsible for certain taxes imposed on various persons including conexant as a result of either the failure of certain spin off transactions to qualify as a reorganization for us federal income tax purposes  or the failure of certain spin off transactions to qualify as tax free to conexant for certain us federal income tax purposes  if such failure is attributable to certain actions or transactions by or in respect of skyworks including our subsidiaries or our stockholders  such as the acquisition of stock of skyworks by a third party at a time and in a manner that would cause such failure 
in addition  the tax allocation agreement provides that we will be responsible for various other tax obligations and for compliance with various representations  statements  and conditions made in the course of obtaining the tax ruling referenced above and in connection with the tax allocation agreement 
our obligations under the tax allocation agreement have been limited by a letter agreement dated november  entered into in connection with our debt refinancing with conexant 
nevertheless  if we do not carefully monitor our compliance with the requirements imposed as a result of the spin off and related transactions and our responsibilities under the tax allocation agreement  we might inadvertently trigger an obligation to indemnify certain persons including conexant pursuant to the tax allocation agreement or other obligations under such agreement 
in addition  our indemnity obligations could discourage or prevent a third party from making a proposal to acquire skyworks 
if we were required to pay any of the taxes described above  the payment could be very substantial and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
in addition  it is expected that the interest payments we are required to make on our million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due june  originally issued to conexant will not be deductible for tax purposes 
our inability to offset our interest expense from these notes against other income may increase our tax liability currently and in future years 
further  the terms of these senior subordinated notes require us to pay the principal due at the maturity date or upon certain acceleration events in a number of shares of our common stock equal to the principal due at such time divided by the applicable conversion price on such date 
if the fair market value of our common stock on such date is less than the applicable conversion price  we may recognize cancellation of indebtedness income for tax purposes equal to the excess of the principal amount of these notes due at such time over the fair market value of the common stock issued by us to satisfy our obligations under these notes 
certain provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us 
we have certain anti takeover measures that may affect our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and the delaware general corporation law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws include provisions such as the division of our board of directors into three classes to be elected on a staggered basis  one class each year  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent  elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders  a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least percent of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal any provision of our by laws or the provision of our certificate of incorporation relating to amendments to our by laws  a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least percent of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors  the classified board or the right to act by written consent  a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least percent of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the board of directors and  in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of percent or more of our shares  a majority of the members of board of directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of percent or more of our shares  a fair price provision  and a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least percent of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision 
in addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws  section of the delaware general corporation law generally provides that a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder  unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met 
we may be liable for penalties under environmental laws  rules and regulations  which could adversely impact our business 
we have used  and will continue to use  a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental protection regulations in the united states 
while we have not experienced any material adverse effect on our operations as a result of such regulations  we cannot assure you that current or future regulations would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action regardless of fault 
consequently  it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters  including potential liabilities 
we cannot assure you that the amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities  to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future 
accordingly  you might not be able to sell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors  including our performance and prospects  the performance and prospects of our major customers  the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock  investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate  changes in earnings estimates or buy sell recommendations by analysts  general financial and other market conditions  and domestic and international economic conditions 
public stock markets have experienced  and are currently experiencing  extreme price and trading volume volatility  particularly in the technology sectors of the market 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  fluctuations in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum  hedge or day trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction  particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks  such as changes in currency and interest rates  that arise from normal business operation 
our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  short term debt and long term debt 
our main investment objective is the preservation of investment capital 
consequently  we invest with only high credit quality issuers and we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or investment purposes 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of september   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 
our short term debt primarily consists of borrowings under our receivables purchase agreement 
as of september   we had borrowed million under this agreement 
in addition  our short term debt includes the remaining portion of a ten year  loan from the state of maryland under the community development block grant program due december at an interest rate of percent 
interest related to our short term debt is at a fixed rate 
consequently  we do not have significant cash flow exposure on our short term debt 
we issued fixed rate debt  which is convertible into our common stock at a predetermined or market related conversion price 
convertible debt has characteristics that give rise to both interest rate risk and market risk because the fair value of the convertible security is affected by both the current interest rate environment and the price of the underlying common stock 
for the year ended september  our convertible debt  on an if converted basis  was not dilutive and  as a result  had no impact on our net income per share assuming dilution 
in future periods  the debt may be converted  or the if converted method may be dilutive and net income per share assuming dilution would be reduced 
our long term debt consists of million of percent unsecured convertible subordinated notes due november and million of percent unsecured convertible senior subordinated notes due june we do not believe that we have significant cash flow exposure on our long term debt 
based on our overall evaluation of our market risk exposures from all of our financial instruments at september  a near term change in market rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
