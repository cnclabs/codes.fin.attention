the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation

actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents we derive our revenues from advertising and non advertising sources 
advertising revenues are derived principally from advertising and sponsorship arrangements 
in our advertising contracts we typically guarantee a minimum number of impressions or pages to be delivered to users over a specified period of time for a fixed fee 
advertising revenues are recognized on the basis of the number of impressions delivered or ratably over the period in which the advertising is displayed  whichever amount is lower  when the collectibility is reasonably assured 
to the extent that minimum guaranteed impressions deliveries is not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed impressions deliveries are achieved 
sponsorship arrangements typically allow advertisers to sponsor a particular area on our network in exchange for a fixed payment over the contract period 
advertising revenues are recognized ratably over the period of sponsorship 
advertising revenues derived from the design  coordination and integration of advertising campaigns and sponsorship to be placed on our web sites are recognized ratably over the term of such programs 
revenue from barter transactions is recognized during the period in which the advertisements are displayed in our properties 
barter transactions are recorded at the lower of the fair value of the goods or services received or the fair value of the advertisement given  provided the fair value of the transaction is reliably measurable 
non advertising revenues are derived from proprietary software products and licenses  e commerce and other fee based services 
revenue from the sale of software products is recognized primarily on the delivery of software products to end users  resellers  distributors  retail merchants and original equipment manufacturers 
we deliver our software products in packaged form or under software licenses 
revenues from sales of software products in the packaged form are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  shipment is made and collectibility is reasonably assured 
software license agreements are non refundable and allow the oem partners to reproduce our software products for a specified period of time for a fixed fee or a specified number of copies for a predetermined unit price 
revenues from software license agreements are recognized upon delivery of a master copy when the fixed fee agreements become effective or based upon activity reports provided by the oem partners under the per copy arrangements 
provision is made for expected sales returns and allowances when revenue is recognized 
payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
we recognize revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop these statements generally require revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements 
our software product agreements do not involve multiple elements 
e commerce revenues are derived principally from slotting fees charged to merchants for selective positioning and promoting their goods or services within our online mall  sinamall  and from commissions calculated as a percentage of the online sales transaction value of the merchants 
slotting fee revenue is recognized ratably over the period the products are shown on our web site while the commission revenue is recognized on a net basis after both successful on line verification of customers credit cards and shipment of products 
product returns have not been significant and are assumed by vendors 
fee based services revenues mainly include wireless short messaging  subscription services and paid email services

we contract with third party mobile operators for certain services related to the wireless short messages and subscriptions transmitted to sina s users and records the fees charged by the third party mobile operators as cost of revenues 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  the recognition of revenues is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 

table of contents we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be recognized as expense in the period such determination was made

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our investment policy limits our investments of excess cash to government or quasi government securities and in high quality corporate securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
due to the fact that majority of our investments are in short term instruments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure in this area 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our revenues derived and expenses and liabilities incurred were in chinese renminbi  taiwan dollars and hong kong dollars 
thus  our revenues and operating results may be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations in the currencies of china  taiwan and hong kong 
see risk factors currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency exchange may adversely affect our business  including limiting our ability to convert chinese renminbi into foreign currencies and  if renminbi were to decline in value  reducing our revenue in us dollar terms 
we have not tried to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by using hedging transactions 
however  we may choose to do so in the future 
we may not be able to do this successfully 
accordingly  we may experience economic losses and negative impacts on earnings and equity as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the foreign subsidiaries and the underlying exposures described above 
as of december and june   the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
investment risk on september   we acquired an approximately interest in the equity of sun media sun media group  a satellite tv broadcaster and a cable tv program syndicator listed on the hong kong stock exchange

we invested in this company for business and strategic purposes and have classified this investment as a long term investment  which had been accounted for using the equity method until 
table of contents september  we ceased to maintain significant influence over sun media s operations after our equity interest fell below and our board representation was decreased 
accordingly  commencing with the quarter ended december   we began accounting for our investment in sun media as an investment in marketable equity securities under the provisions of sfas such investment is classified as available for sale and reported at fair market value with unrealized gains losses  if any  recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
during the quarter ended december   we began marking this investment to market value and thus recorded  in unrealized gains on our marketable equity securities as a component of comprehensive income
