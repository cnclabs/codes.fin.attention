accounting for intangibles and impairment on june   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and eliminates the pooling method of accounting 
sfas no 
did not have an impact on the company s business since the company has historically accounted for all business combinations using the purchase method of accounting 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite life  such as broadcast licenses  associated with acquisitions consummated prior to june   ceased being amortized after december  and those related to acquisitions after june  will never be amortized 
the broadcast licenses have an indefinite life because the company expects to renew them and renewals are routinely granted with little cost  provided that the licensee has complied with the applicable fcc rules and regulations 
over the last five years  all licenses that have been up for renewal have been renewed  and there has been no compelling challenge to the license renewal 
the technology used in broadcasting is not expected to be replaced by another technology in the foreseeable future 
therefore  the broadcast licenses and the related cash flows are expected to continue indefinitely 
these indefinite cash flows indicate that the broadcast licenses have an indefinite useful life 
therefore  the license would not be amortized until its useful life is deemed to no longer be indefinite 
the licenses are tested annually for impairment in accordance with paragraph of fas however  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment exists 
the company has evaluated its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with the guidelines of sfas no 
as it relates to assessing impairment and has concluded that it does not have an impairment loss related to these assets 
in addition  under sfas no 
 an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged 
intangible assets with measurable lives will be amortized over their respective useful lives 
the use of the purchase method of accounting requires management to make certain judgments in estimates related to the fair value of assets acquired 
the adoption of sfas no 
has resulted in a substantial reduction of intangible amortization expense in since the company s broadcast licenses and goodwill are no longer being amortized by the company 
on a historic basis  the company had amortization of intangible assets of   and  in  and  respectively 
had this accounting change been in effect in and  amortization of intangible assets would have been  and  respectively 
during  the company incurred amortization expense of  related to the valuation of amortizable identified intangibles  primarily artist contracts  resulting from the fonovisa acquisition on april  artist contracts are contracts acquired under the fonovisa acquisition and represent agreements between fonovisa and music artists to produce recording masters to be used primarily for future releases of albums
