industry general background the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer a round disk that is six  eight or twelve inches in diameter  about as thick as a credit card and gray in color 
the process of manufacturing wafers is in itself highly sophisticated  involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon 
the ingots are then sliced into wafers and polished to a mirror finish on one surface  upon which the circuits are made 
page the fabrication of an ic  or chip  is accomplished by depositing upon a silicon wafer a series of film layers that act as conductors  semiconductors or insulators 
the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns  remove portions of the film layers  and perform other functions such as heat treatment  measurement and inspection 
most advanced chip designs require over individual steps  many of which are performed multiple times 
most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure  typically consisting of transistors or capacitors  which perform the smart functions of the chip  and the upper structure  typically consisting of interconnect circuitry  which connects the components in the lower structure 
current trends companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes  as well as bringing them into production  are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market 
during past industry cycles  semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with one key new technology or market trend  such as a specific design rule shrink 
in today s market  the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in bringing a multitude of new technologies into production at the same time  including copper interconnects  new materials  sub micron design rules and mm wafers the next larger wafer size  from which more than twice as many ics can be produced as from mm wafers 
while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages  significant challenges and risks associated with each one have slowed their adoption into full volume production 
for example  as design rules decrease  yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects  while device performance characteristics namely speed or capacity become more sensitive to such parameters as line width and film thickness variation 
copper introduces new physical defects  which are harder to find within the interconnect structure  as well as electrical defects  which cannot be detected using conventional optical inspection systems 
new process materials like low k dielectrics  silicon on insulator soi and nm photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be made manufacturable 
larger mm wafers are more susceptible to damage than mm wafers since they can bend or bow twice as much  creating stress on the wafer that can result in yield loss 
film uniformity is also more difficult to maintain on these larger wafers 
moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face since technical challenges in bringing any one of these into production could also slow the adoption of the other technologies 
our key activities during fiscal year involved the development of new process control and yield management tools that enable chipmakers to accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into full volume production  while minimizing their associated risks 
with our portfolio of application focused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise  we are in a position to be the single source for comprehensive yield management solutions that enable our customers to achieve first to market success for their next generation products 
the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller linewidth geometries and more complex multi level circuitry has significantly increased the cost and performance requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices 
construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over billion  a substantial increase over the cost of previous generation facilities 
as a result  chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment 
because our process control and yield management equipment typically represents only a small  but growing  percentage of the total investment required to build a fabrication facility  our customers are better able to leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment roi 
page our process control and yield acceleration solutions accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing the production yields of high performance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing 
achieving higher yields faster  along with higher performance characteristics  increases the revenue a manufacturer can obtain from each semiconductor wafer 
our systems are used to analyze product and process quality at all critical points in the wafer  photomask and ic manufacturing process  and provide feedback to our customers so that fabrication problems can be identified  addressed and eliminated 
this ability to locate the source of defects and other process issues  as well as contain them  enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes  as well as increase their yields and device value thus maximizing their roi and lowering their manufacturing costs 
the following are some of the methods used to accelerate yields and optimize device performance  all of which require the capture and analysis of data gathered through many measurements engineering analysis this method of analysis is performed offline from the manufacturing process to identify  analyze and locate the source of defects or other manufacturing process issues 
engineering analysis equipment operates with very high sensitivity to enable comprehensive analysis of wafers 
because this method operates off the manufacturing line  high operational speeds are not required 
inline monitoring this method of analysis is used to review the status of ics during production 
information generated is used to determine whether the fabrication process steps are within required tolerances 
it is also used to make any necessary real time process adjustments before wafer lots move to subsequent process stations 
because information related to defects is needed quickly  inline monitoring requires both high throughput and high sensitivity 
pass fail tests this method of analysis may be used at several different points in the manufacturing process to evaluate whether products meet performance specifications 
the most significant opportunities for yield and device performance improvement generally occur when production is started at new factories and technology shifts in existing factories 
equipment that helps a manufacturer quickly increase new product yields and optimize device performance enables the manufacturer to offer these new products in high volumes early in the product lifecycle the time when they are likely to generate the greatest profits 
page we are a leader in the design  manufacture  marketing and service of process monitoring and yield management systems for the semiconductor wafer  ic and photomask industries 
our technical expertise and understanding of customer needs enable us to provide unique yield management solutions and one of the broadest lines of process monitoring and yield optimization systems available 
our systems are used to analyze product and process quality at critical points during semiconductor manufacturing  as well as provide feedback to our customers that can be used to identify  address  contain and eliminate fabrication problems 
products we market and sell products to virtually all major semiconductor  wafer  photomask and data storage manufacturers worldwide 
we combine our hardware consisting of patterned and unpatterned wafer inspection  optical overlay metrology  e beam review  reticle and photomask inspection  spectroscopic and e beam based cd metrology  and film and surface measurement tools with our advanced yield analysis and defect classification software to provide fab wide yield management solutions that are optimized for the manufacturing process cells used in ic production  including lithography  etch  deposition and chemical mechanical planarization cmp 
our offerings can be broadly categorized into five groups defect inspection  metrology  yield management software solutions  data storage  and customer service and support 
defect inspection our defect inspection tools are used to detect  count  classify and characterize particles  pattern defects and electrical failures both inline at various manufacturing process stages and offline engineering analysis 
we pioneered the market for automated defect inspection of semiconductor wafers and reticles more than two decades ago 
our portfolio includes all the tools necessary for our customers to detect  correlate and analyze physical and electrical defects  as well as determine and correct their cause 
high resolution imaging inspection our xxx wafer inspection series  first introduced in  set the standard for high sensitivity patterned wafer inspection through a unique combination of high speed image processing  an ultra broadband brightfield illumination source and our segmented auto threshold technology 
to date  more than one thousand xxx systems have been installed at customer facilities worldwide 
in  we unveiled the  an ultraviolet uv inspection system to feature ultra broadband brightfield illumination 
delivering an increase in throughput over the previous generation xxx platform  the enabled the resolution of circuit patterns and defects for micron and smaller processes 
in  we introduced an upgrade to the  the  which offers enhancements in sensitivity  throughput and ease of use 
in june  we introduced our latest generation high resolution imaging inspection system  the  which incorporates multiple bandwidth brightfield illumination and other enhancements to extend the performance of the xxx series to the nm micron technology node and below 
page high speed laser scattering inspection our ait wafer inspection family is designed for providing fast and accurate feedback on process tool performance  as well as advanced line monitoring for films  cmp  and non critical etch and photo modules 
the ait series uses patented double darkfield technology  which is a low angle illumination technique particularly effective for detecting defects on planar surfaces such as post cmp wafers 
first introduced in  the ait platform has been continually enhanced over the years with increasing levels of sensitivity and throughput to address the inspection needs for micron and smaller design rules 
in april  we introduced the aitfusion and aitfusionuv  our latest generation darkfield inspection systems 
the aitfusion uv was developed specifically to address the special inspection and excursion monitoring needs of sub nm processes on mm wafers 
the aitfusion uv s unique inline data processing capabilities speed the resolution of critical yield issues to lower the cost of inspection  thus accelerating chipmakers ramp to volume production yields 
electrical line monitoring scanning electron microscopes sems use an electron beam to image and measure surface features on a semiconductor wafer at a much higher resolution than images captured by optical microscopes 
as the industry drives below the micron node  the combination of smaller process windows  new materials and more complicated process integration at these smaller geometries has given rise to a new and challenging class of defects 
defects  which are small  sub surface  or within high aspect ratio structures  can lead to significant yield and reliability issues in production 
in addition  a majority of these new defects are electrical in nature and cannot be detected by optical inspection technologies 
accelerating yield learning for today s advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes  especially in the development and early ramp phases  is made more difficult by the task of isolating these yield killing defects from the thousands of non relevant defects induced by material anomalies a time consuming process 
in addition  due to the extremely tight process margins associated with today s advanced ic designs  these electrical defects can recur at random during volume production 
thus  e beam inspection is essential not only during ic development  where the highest levels of sensitivity are needed to root out the vast majority of these electrical defects  but also in production  where dedicated high speed e beam inspection systems are required at key process steps 
we pioneered this market with the introduction of the industry s first e beam inspection system more than a decade ago 
since that time  we have continued to leverage our expertise in e beam technology to bring new solutions to market that will enable our customers to identify electrical defect mechanisms faster  thereby accelerating their yield ramps  time to market and time to profit on their next generation chips 
page our loop methodology  introduced in  provides a fab wide framework of solutions that accelerates yield learning for new semiconductor processes in development through a merger of inspection  metrology and electrical test data 
edo  the first product in the loop family  combines non contact electrical test with inline physical defect inspection to produce a fast root cause analysis method available in the industry today 
using edo  chipmakers can reduce the length of their yield learning cycles 
in may  we introduced the latest addition to our esxx series  called es representing the culmination of more than years of experience in wafer inspection  the es is an e beam inspection tool specifically designed for high volume production line monitoring of electrical defects 
the successor to our widely adopted esxp tool  the es delivers better throughput  sensitivity and image resolution capability of its predecessor  while allowing users to classify defects in real time and trend by defect type 
the es is targeted to enable our customers to adopt and proliferate cost effective electrical defect monitoring strategies in their high volume production environments 
the es provides the sensitivity needed for advanced process development down to the nm node 
optical and e beam defect review our defect review capability includes optical confocal and e beam scanning technology 
in  we introduced the original crs optical review system  which enables high speed defect review and classification on both patterned and unpatterned mm and mm wafers 
in  we introduced the ev defect review system an advanced  automated sem designed to gather and analyze defect excursion information  as well as report the results with the improved sensitivity required at micron and smaller design rules 
the ev supplements optical review by providing topographical information  enabling more accurate defect classification than can be achieved by optical review systems alone 
unpatterned wafer inspection in  we introduced the surfscan sp for bare wafer qualification  process monitoring and equipment monitoring applications 
the sp tbi triple beam illumination was introduced in  and was designed with additional optical configurations needed to detect sub micron defects on metal films and rough surfaces  while still providing sensitivity below nm on polished silicon 
the sp tbi is also used for detecting defects on non uniform films  a critical requirement for cmp applications 
in  we introduced a surface nanotopography measurement capability for the sp that enhances lithography and cmp process monitoring for micron process development 
in  we unveiled the sp dls  the first mm tool to provide brightfield  darkfield and nanotopography defect information in a single scan 
it has the sensitivity to capture a wide variety of defects as small as nm at high throughput speeds 
page macro after develop inspection in  with the introduction of the macro defect inspection system we enabled our customers to automate after develop inspection adi for macro defects 
designed to replace inefficient manual macro adi  the is an automated inspection system able to detect and classify front end macro lithographic defects  which are microns and larger in size 
manual adi methods may capture a small fraction of photo related defects as a result of wafer complexity  background patterning noise and human fatigue 
in contrast  the captures most critical macro adi defects  while providing defect classification and yield information to reduce scrap and enable continuous process improvements 
macro defects  which can ruin the entire wafer  are costly to chipmakers in mm production  since more than twice the number of die are at risk with these larger wafers compared to mm wafers 
in  we introduced the macro adi series  which brought the benefits of the to mm production 
photo cell monitoring the introduction of thinner photoresists  new resist chemistries  tighter process windows and smaller design rules have all given rise to new and smaller defect types within the lithography cell a large area of investment within the fab 
defect management in the lithography cell is thus critical for qualifying new lithography processes  and establishing a benchmark for controlling defects and minimizing yield losses during production 
in  we introduced our pcm micro photo cell monitor solution to provide fabs with a methodology for identifying and eliminating lithography related micro defects before product lots are placed at risk 
combining our most advanced defect management hardware and software tools  a new proprietary reticle design  optimized test wafers and industry leading expertise  pcm provides high sensitivity and capture rate required for reducing lithography related micro defects 
it monitors the health of the lithography cell and enables chipmakers to make rapid and accurate go no go decisions about their product reticles  track systems and exposure tools 
backside wafer inspection in  we unveiled a new backside inspection module bsim option for the surfscan sp series that provides an automated  non destructive inspection solution for the backsides of patterned production wafers 
wafer backside defects can have a significant impact on wafer and process uniformity  both of which are critical issues in advanced mm processing 
our field trials indicate that these backside defects can arise at nearly every process step  and result in yield loss amounting to millions of dollars annually in lost revenue 
the surfscan sp with bsim enables automated  non destructive wafer backside inspection to be incorporated as a routine step into every process module  enabling recovery of these yield losses and helping chipmakers further realize the economic gains in moving to mm 
page reticle inspection error free reticles are the first step in ensuring high yields in the manufacturing process  since defects in reticles can be replicated on wafers 
reticles are high precision quartz plates that contain microscopic images of electronic circuits 
placed into steppers or scanners  these reticles are used to transfer circuit patterns onto wafers to fabricate ics 
the extension of optical lithography below the micron node has resulted in the mask error enhancement factor  where reticle defects once too small to print on the wafer become enhanced in the lithography process to create yield killing wafer defects 
we pioneered the market for automated reticle and photomask inspection over two decades ago  and continue to be a market leader in addressing our customers evolving inspection requirements 
in  we unveiled our terastar reticle inspection system for high resolution reticle inspection down to the nm node 
with its ability to inspect up to a terapixel one million by one million pixels per reticle  terastar provides improvements in throughput compared to previous generation systems 
tera algorithms enable the inspection of smaller linewidth geometries and complex resolution enhancement techniques  such as optical proximity correction opc assist features and phase shift masks psms 
its high throughput and sensitivity make terastar ideal for pre and post pelliclization inspection in photomask manufacturing operations  as well as incoming quality control and reticle re qualification in wafer fabs 
reticle cd errors is a major cause of yield loss in ic manufacturing at the micron node 
in  we introduced a new option on terastar  called teraflux  which detects minute but relevant cd errors on contact and via layer reticles prior to their first use in the wafer fab 
teraflux measures the energy that passes through the contact hole and compares it to another reference either die or database to look for unexpected energy variations 
this enables the terastar system to capture reticle cd defects  such as incorrectly sized contacts or semi transparencies both of which will adversely affect the amount of light passing through the contact holes during the lithography process 
by capturing these critical defects during reticle inspection and qualification  teraflux enables chipmakers to ramp their deep sub wavelength lithography processes into production  while minimizing the costs associated with scrapped wafers 
in june  we introduced terascan  the successor to terastar 
a deep ultraviolet duv reticle inspection tool developed for sub nm ic production  terascan offers high sensitivity to detect classical defects intrusions  extrusions and point defects as small as nm  and cd defects as small as nm 
terascan has the ability to inspect nearly any type of photomask used in ic production  regardless of reticle wavelength and resolution enhancement technology  for sub nm design rules 
page metrology our metrology or process window optimization products provide virtually all of the critical measurements fabs require to manage their advanced manufacturing processes 
with our unique combination of overlay  cd  film thickness and reflectivity measurements  ic manufacturers have the capabilities to maintain tight control of their lithography  etch  deposition and cmp processes 
optical overlay decreasing linewidths  larger die sizes and increasing numbers of layers in semiconductor devices all affect the tolerances for layer to layer matching  or overlay  and can result in overlay misregistration errors a crucial cause of yield loss 
metrology systems are needed to measure the alignment between different layers of the semiconductor device to ensure overlay parameters are kept within specification 
kla tencor s overlay metrology systems are more tolerant of process and substrate reflectivity variations than other optical systems  and provide the measurements that our customers need to fine tune their lithography systems to compensate for these errors and improve process yield 
in  we unveiled archer  which enables overlay measurements to within nm for sub micron and mm production 
to augment the performance of the archer  we introduced a new software tool in called archer analyzer that conducts fully automated  real time  on tool overlay metrology analysis 
seamlessly integrated with the archer  archer analyzer provides information  such as wafer lot dispositioning and stepper correction data  which helps chipmakers eliminate unnecessary wafer rework and quickly address variations in the performance of their lithography tools to minimize yield loss 
in february  we introduced archer aim  our most advanced optical overlay metrology solution to date 
archer aim leverages a grating style target technology to capture design rule overlay errors and improve the accuracy of stepper corrections 
archer targets are denser than traditional box in box targets  resulting in the collection of more process information for improved correlation to in device overlay performance 
they can also be segmented for each device layer to meet specific customer requirements 
these benefits  combined with archer aim s precision performance  enable the system to reduce the total measurement uncertainty associated with traditional overlay metrology solutions for sub nm design rules 
focus exposure line monitoring focus exposure control in lithography is a key challenge for cd control at the micron node and below 
unseen lithography focus exposure excursions can result in cd process variations that lead to lower yields  cause unnecessary and costly rework  and reduce scanner productivity 
monitoring focus and exposure variations inline is thus critical to maintaining tight cd control at these advanced design rules 
a new option on our archer overlay metrology platform  called mpx  enables lithographers to control stepper defocus and exposure variations on product wafers non destructively 
leveraging dual tone design targets and analysis software  mpx can simultaneously provide separate exposure and focus measurements on product wafers with a high degree of sensitivity and precision 
this enables mpx to provide fast and accurate feedback on the key parameters needed to maintain tight cd control in sub micron ic production  without requiring periodic offline monitoring of the exposure tool 
page process window monitoring over time  optimal focus and exposure settings for a given lithography cell and process can drift and change in a variety of ways  such as cd variations during the patterning process  which result in significant yield losses 
knowing not just the optimal process settings  but also the size of the process window and the sensitivity to process variation  is critical for stable and efficient pattern transfer 
our process window monitor pwm series of cd metrology systems enables chipmakers to monitor and match the process windows of every lithography cell and process in the fab in real time 
building upon the high precision  throughput and sensitivity of our cd sem and optical cd metrology tools  the new ecd pwm and spectracd pwm series of systems enable a variety of exposure tool based diagnostics to be off loaded to the metrology tools  increasing production capacity and overall equipment effectiveness of lithography cells 
in addition  enhanced focus exposure process window information can be provided by the pwm systems to supplement information obtained by our archer mpx technology to enable rapid excursion detection and root cause analysis 
e beam cd metrology every nanometer in cd variation in the ic manufacturing process affects device performance  which consequently impacts yield and bottom line profitability 
at the nm node  reducing process variation by a single nanometer can improve microprocessor speed by mhz 
the ecd unveiled in february features the precision and resolution to meet the cd metrology performance requirements for the nm technology node and beyond 
the ecd is based on a new platform  and all its design aspects have been precision suited for nm node metrology requirements  and extendible to the nm node 
ecd is well suited for applications involving nm lithography and very high aspect ratio structures 
our pqc pattern quality confirmation software enables the ecd to provide inline  real time monitoring of feature shape integrity during the patterning process enabling the detection of subtle variations in feature shape that can occur at and below the micron node and go undetected by traditional cd sem measurements 
our r reticle cd control system provides precise and high throughput measurements on advanced reticles used in the production of sub micron devices 
page spectroscopic cd metrology new materials that are used in advanced ic production  such as low k dielectrics and photoresists for nm lithography  are difficult to control during lithography and etch processes 
as a result  they require taking more comprehensive data on device features and linewidths to identify and correct process variations and remain within process windows 
our spectracd system provides non destructive simultaneous and extensive cd  feature shape and film thickness measurements for nm lithography applications and sub nm device production 
wafer geometry and nanotopography metrology as device geometries shrink  semiconductor yields become increasingly dependent upon the flatness and nanotopography of wafer substrates 
even the slightest variation in topography on the wafer s surface can impact lithography and front end cmp processes  affecting device performance and yields 
the growing adoption of soi wafers for high speed  low power applications is also driving the need for advanced metrology in soi wafer manufacturing  since any variation in topography can ultimately affect device yield 
in  we introduced nanopro np  the industry s first single tool solution for wafer geometry and nanotopography metrology 
nanopro np combines wafer shape  thickness  flatness and nanotopography metrology in a single scan  and can monitor soi and bare wafers inline throughout the wafer fabrication process from grinding and etching to rough and final polish 
it can be used to monitor all types of mm and mm wafers  including single side polished  double side polished  epitaxial and soi wafers  as well as rough  pre polished surfaces 
with nanopro np  wafer manufacturers obtain more comprehensive wafer characterization data needed for accelerating process improvement and development  as well as reducing production time 
film measurement our film measurement products measure a variety of optical and electrical properties of thin films 
these products are used to control a wide range of wafer fabrication steps  where both within wafer and wafer to wafer process uniformity are of paramount importance to semiconductor manufacturers enabling them to achieve high device performance characteristics at low cost 
in  we introduced the uv se  which brought a new technology to production  called spectroscopic ellipsometry se 
our third generation se thin film measurement tool  the aset f  addressed the film measurement needs that came from the continuing evolution of film development driven by shorter linewidths 
in  we introduced an enhanced version of the aset f  known as the aset fx 
it incorporates a single wavelength ellipsometry swe option to complement the industry leading se and dual beam spectrophotometry dbs technologies incorporated in the aset f for even greater accuracy  repeatability and system to system matching 
in  we unveiled spectrafx  our latest generation thin film metrology system  which delivers the precision  matching and stability required for advanced film measurement applications for nm device production  including nm lithography processes 
designed to fully support next generation and operator free mm fabs with automation and tool to tool matching capabilities  spectrafx enables foundries and other multi product high volume chip manufacturers to reduce the process development time for advanced materials and accelerate their adoption into volume production 
these materials include nm photoresists  complex copper dual damascene film stacks  and low k and high k dielectrics 
page in july  we introduced a new option for spectrafx called accufilm  which eliminates the effects of airborne molecular contamination amc on ultra thin film measurements 
a key roadblock to achieving control of advanced gate processes below the nm node  amc grows rapidly on film surfaces and degrades the accuracy and repeatability of gate dielectric metrology 
accufilm enables spectrafx to remove these contaminants from product wafers in a matter of seconds before taking film measurements at each measurement site without placing product at risk 
it is a valuable enhancement for measuring extremely thin gate dielectric films  which are essential for the production of high performance nm and nm devices 
under development in fiscal year and introduced early in fiscal year  kla tencor also offers the metrix  the industry s first inline  non contact metal films metrology system to provide independent measurements of both film composition and thickness on product wafers 
with film composition becoming as critical as film thickness in determining the functionality and reliability of advanced ics  metrix s ability to measure both parameters makes it an ideal tool for production line monitoring at the nm node and process development for the nm and below nodes 
contamination monitoring gate dielectric quality is critical to the speed and reliability of an ic 
below the micron node  dielectrics become so thin less than angstroms  or the equivalent of micron that electrical performance characteristics of the dielectric films become just as critical as physical characteristics in determining overall transistor performance 
our quantox product line provides non contact  inline electrical performance measurements of all the key parameters that determine the quality of advanced gate dielectric films  including contamination and oxide thickness  as well as electrical capacitance and leakage 
in  we introduced the latest addition to this product family  called quantox xp 
quantox xp provides information on both the physical and electrical properties of advanced gate dielectric materials in real time 
these materials include silicon oxynitride sion and high k dielectrics  which are required for sub micron ic production 
quantox xp data provides high correlation to device electrical test data  enabling chipmakers to predict transistor performance inline  rather than having to wait until end of line electrical test a process that normally can take days or weeks to complete 
page in situ cmp end point detection in copper deposition  metal film thickness and uniformity can vary significantly from wafer to wafer 
to compensate for these variances during cmp  chipmakers have traditionally had to either take copper wafers offline  which dramatically slows the production process  or instead use optical only in situ metrology methods  which provide limited information and unreliable end point data 
in  we unveiled precice  a production worthy in situ film thickness and end point control system for copper cmp that provides measurements in real time 
precice reduces the risk of process errors due to non uniform polishing  thereby speeding the ramp of new copper processes and maximizing copper yields 
surface metrology our stylus profilers measure the surface topography of films and etched surfaces  and are used in basic research and development as well as semiconductor production and quality control 
in  we introduced the hrp etch  the latest generation of our hrp high resolution profilers 
this system combines the dishing and erosion measurement capabilities of our long scan profilers with high aspect ratio etched feature measurement capability  which has historically been limited to atomic force microscopes 
this allows customers to monitor their critical etch processes  such as shallow trench isolation sti and dual damascene via trench 
we also provide stress measurement systems and capabilities  such as our new wafer bow and wafer stress option for our aset fx and spectrafx thin film metrology tools  which detects reliability related problems such as film cracking  voiding and lifting 
yield management software solutions our productivity and analysis software systems translate raw inspection and metrology data into patterns that reveal process problems and help semiconductor manufacturers develop long term yield improvement strategies 
yield data analysis and management in  we acquired taiwan based acme systems  inc  a provider of yield correlation software 
combining the newly acquired technology from acme with our own yield management expertise led to the development of our klarity ace yield analysis software  which helps our customers quickly identify the source of defects and process problems  as well as correct them 
with our acquisition of finle technologies in  we developed our klarity prodata lithography data analysis software  which  along with our prolith lithography and etch simulation software  helps manufacturers reduce their advanced lithography development time and cost 
page in  we introduced our impact xp automated defect classification adc software  which provides consistent and accurate classification of yield limiting defects to help our customers accelerate their ramp to higher process yields 
impact xp incorporates our smartgallery tool  which reduces the setup time associated with adc implementation in fabs 
this is a critical requirement  particularly for foundries and application specific integrated circuit asic manufacturers  who specialize in short runs of multiple products 
our real time classification rtc and inline adc iadc technologies  which provide classification and binning of defect types in real time during inspection  are critical features on all of our latest generation e beam and optical inspection tools 
in  we introduced our recipe management service  called irecipe  which allows factory engineers to quickly and easily access existing recipes and associated information that reside on a central database from any personal computer that is connected to the fab intranet 
by integrating irecipe into their fab network  chipmakers can reduce their inspection and metrology tool coo  as well as improve their overall fab efficiency
