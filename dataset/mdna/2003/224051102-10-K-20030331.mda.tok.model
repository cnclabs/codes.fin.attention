item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general cox radio  inc is a leading national radio broadcast company whose business is acquiring  developing and operating radio stations located throughout the united states 
cox enterprises indirectly owns approximately of the common stock of cox radio and has approximately of the voting power of cox radio 
the primary source of our revenues is the sale of local and national advertising to be broadcast on our radio stations 
historically  approximately and of our net revenues have been generated from local and national advertising  respectively 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  our stations also exchange advertising time for goods or services  which can be used by the stations in their business operations 
we generally confine the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which we would otherwise have paid cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to pre empt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 
our most significant station operating expenses are employees salaries and benefits  commissions  programming expenses and advertising and promotional expenditures 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our revenues and operating income are typically lowest in the first quarter 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotional expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of the advertising and promotion is realized in future periods 
critical accounting estimates use of estimates our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the radio broadcasting industry 
an accounting estimate would be a critical accounting estimate for purposes of the disclosure herein only if it meets two criteria 
first  the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made 
second  it must be the case that different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to intangible assets  bad debts  contingencies and litigation  income taxes and fair value of financial instruments as discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk below 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and results of operations for the reporting periods 
we believe the following are the critical accounting estimates that require the most significant judgments and assumptions and are particularly susceptible to a significant change in the preparation of our financial statements 
impairment of intangible assets on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and were required to assess our goodwill and fcc licenses for impairment within the first six months of  and on at least an annual basis thereafter 
our intangible assets consist primarily of fcc licenses  but also include goodwill and other intangible assets 
at december   we had approximately billion in intangible assets  which represents approximately of our total assets 
the fair value of the fcc licenses is dependent on the cash flows of our stations 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets  we utilize independent appraisals to determine the fair market value 
these appraisals principally 
table of contents use the discounted cash flow methodology 
this income approach consists of a quantitative model  which incorporates variables such as market advertising revenues  market revenue share projections  anticipated operating profit margins and various discount rates 
the variables used in the analysis reflect historical station and advertising market growth trends  as well as anticipated performance and market conditions 
multiples of operating cash flow are also considered 
in the future  if these estimates change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets  which could have a material impact on our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts a provision for doubtful accounts is charged to operations based on our evaluation of the probable losses in our accounts and notes receivable portfolio 
this evaluation considers the balance of aged receivables  the nature and volume of the portfolio  specific problem accounts and notes receivable  and economic conditions that may affect the debtor s ability to repay  and such other factors as  in our judgment  deserve recognition under existing economic conditions 
accounts and notes receivable are charged off to the allowance when  in our opinion  such receivables are deemed to be uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
contingencies and litigation on an on going basis  we evaluate our exposures related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
income tax estimates we evaluate our effective tax rates regularly and adjust rates when appropriate based on currently available information relative to statutory rates  apportionment factors and the applicable taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  among other factors 
certain of our deferred tax assets are comprised of loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax filing purposes for which recovery is dependent on the amount and timing of taxable income we ultimately generate in the future  as well as other factors 
based on our estimate of future taxable income  there are no potential limitations to the utilization of these deferred tax assets  and therefore  no valuation allowance has been recorded 
tax liabilities are recorded  based on our assessment of the risk of loss in accordance with sfas no 
 to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
we believe our estimate of our tax liabilities is a critical accounting estimate as it contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have currently accrued 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to a number of financial market risks in the ordinary course of business 
our primary financial market risk exposure pertains to changes in interest rates 
we have examined exposures to these risks and concluded that none of the exposures in these areas are material to cash flows or earnings 
we have engaged in several strategies to manage these market risks 
our indebtedness under our various financing arrangements creates interest rate risk 
in connection with each debt issuance and as a result of continual monitoring of interest rates  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements for purposes of managing borrowing costs 
pursuant to the interest rate swap agreements  we have exchanged our floating rate interest obligations on an aggregate of million in notional principal amount of debt for fixed interest rates 
at december   these agreements have an average annual fixed rate of and an average remaining maturity of years 
concurrently with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in january  we formally designated these agreements as cash flow hedges  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we are exposed to a credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by such counterparties  and no material loss would be expected in the event of the counterparties nonperformance 
the estimated fair value of these swap agreements  based on current market rates  approximated a net payable of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the fair value of the swap agreements at december  is included in other long term liabilities according to the respective maturity dates of the swaps 
the determination of the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt is subject to the effects of interest rate risk 
the estimated fair value of the fixed rate debt instruments at december  was million  compared to a carrying amount of million 
the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december  was million  compared to a carrying amount of million 
the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to increase the estimated fair value of the fixed rate debt instruments from million to million at december  and from million to million at december  the estimated fair values of debt instruments are based on discounted cash flow analyses using our borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements and dealer quotations 
our revolving credit facilities and cox enterprises borrowings bear interest based on current market rates and  thus  approximate fair value 
we are exposed to interest rate volatility with respect to the foregoing variable rate debt instruments 
with respect to financial instruments  we have estimated the fair values of such instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies that we believe to be appropriate 
considerable judgment  however  is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we would realize or pay in a current market transaction
