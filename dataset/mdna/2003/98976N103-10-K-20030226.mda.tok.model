critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements  and should be read in conjunction with its summary of significant accounting policies see note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition valuation of current assets and estimating market inventory obsolescence accounting for income taxes revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue on product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  prices are fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
the company considers the point of delivery of the product to be when the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer 
additionally  the company offers limited return rights on its product sales 
at the point of sale  the company also provides for an allowance for sales returns  which is established based on historical experience 
valuation of current assets and estimating market inventory obsolescence 
the company uses significant judgment and estimates in the preparation of its financial statements that affect the carrying values of its assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on estimates of future collectibility of its accounts receivable 
the company regularly analyzes its accounts receivable in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the adequacy of the allowance is determined during the current period based on historical collection experience  customer credit worthiness based on published information and other known factors 
the company maintains a valuation allowance for potentially uncollectable amounts due from its vendors which arise from product returns  standard vendor price protection programs and vendor rebate programs 
amounts received from vendors may vary from amounts recorded based on the difference between the current market price of a product returned and its acquisition price or the denial of price protection or vendor rebates due to noncompliance with specific attributes of the vendor programs 
the company regularly reviews its vendor receivables and provides a valuation allowance based on historical collections and the comparison of amounts recorded versus subsequently received 
the company records inventory at lower of fifo cost or market 
it estimates the amount of unmarketable inventory based on the difference between the cost of the inventory and the market value  which is based on assumptions of market demand  current market conditions  most recent actual sales prices and age and condition of products 
accounting for income taxes 
the company is required to estimate income taxes in the jurisdiction in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual tax exposure while assessing temporary differences resulting in differing treatment for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income and or other tax planning strategies 
the company exercised judgment as of december  and  and did not provide a valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset believing that it is more likely than not that future taxable income and tax planning will be sufficient to recover the deferred tax asset 
however  the guidelines provided by sfas are stringent and if the company is unable to provide positive evidence that the deferred tax asset is recoverable  it will be required to provide a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
if a valuation allowance is deemed to be required  an expense will be recorded within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations
