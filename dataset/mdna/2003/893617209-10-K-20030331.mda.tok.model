item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction tci invests in real estate through acquisitions  leases and partnerships and in mortgage loans on real estate  including first  wraparound and junior mortgage loans 
tci is the successor to a california business trust organized on september   which commenced operations on january  on november   tci acquired all of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of cmet  a real estate company  in a tax free exchange of shares  issuing shares of its common stock for each outstanding cmet share 
tci accounted for the merger as a purchase 
prior to january   tci elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
during the third quarter of  tci no longer met the requirement for tax treatment as a reit due to a concentration of ownership 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of tci s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgements 
tci s critical accounting policies relate to the evaluation of impairment of long lived assets and the evaluation of the collectibility of accounts and notes receivable 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property to be held and used or land held for development may be impaired  management performs a recoverability analysis based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the property in the future 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows the property is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
if management decides to sell rental properties or land held for development  management evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the assets 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from estimated net sales proceeds  the property is written down to estimated fair value less costs to sell and an impairment loss is recognized within income from continuing operations 
tci s estimates of cash flow and fair values of the properties are based on current market conditions and consider matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties  recent sales data for comparable properties and  where applicable  contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers 
tci s estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and tci s assessments of them change 
in the second and third quarter of  tci recognized million and  as impairment losses 
tci s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and notes receivable is established based on analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts 
management considers such information as the nature and age of the receivable  the payment history of the tenant or other debtor  the financial condition of the tenant or other debtor and tci s assessment of its ability to meet its lease or interest obligations 
tci s estimate of the required allowance  which is reviewed on a quarterly basis  is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions 
obligations and commitments tci has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regards to the payment of mortgages

the principal reasons for the change in cash are discussed in the paragraphs below 
tci s principal sources of cash have been and will continue to be from property operations  proceeds from property sales  the collection of mortgage notes receivable  borrowings and to a lesser extent  distributions from partnerships 
management anticipates that tci s cash at december   along with cash that will be generated in from property operations  will not be sufficient to meet all of tci s cash requirements 
management intends to selectively sell income producing real estate  refinance or extend real estate debt and seek additional borrowings against real estate to meet its cash requirements 
historically  management has been successful at extending its current maturity obligations

cash flow from property operations rents collected less payments for property operating expenses was million in  million in  and million in of the decrease in property cash flow from to  million and million was due to the sale of commercial properties and apartments  respectively in and    and  was due to the lower occupancies at tci s commercial  apartment and hotel properties  respectively   was due to increases in property taxes at tci s land properties   was due to the purchase of land parcels in and  and  was due to the completion of the hotel in poland

scheduled principal payments on notes payable of million are due in for those mortgages that mature in  management intends to either seek to extend the due dates one or more years  or refinance the debt on a long term basis 
management also intends to sell income producing properties to retire mortgage debt as it becomes due 
management believes it will continue to be successful in obtaining loan extensions or refinancings 
management reviews the carrying values of tci s properties and mortgage notes receivable at least annually and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
impairment is considered to exist if  in the case of a property  the future cash flow from the property undiscounted and without interest is less than the carrying amount of the property 
for notes receivable impairment is considered to exist if it is probable that all amounts due under the terms of the note will not be collected 
if impairment is found to exist  a provision for loss is recorded by a charge against earnings

environmental matters under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  tci may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs  as well as certain other potential costs  relating to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property where property level managers have arranged for the removal  disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials into the air  and third parties may seek recovery for personal injury associated with such materials 
management is not aware of any environmental liability relating to the above matters that would have a material adverse effect on tci s business  assets or results of operations 
inflation the effects of inflation on tci s operations are not quantifiable 
revenues from property operations tend to fluctuate proportionately with inflationary increases and decreases in housing costs 
fluctuations in the rate of inflation also affect sales values of properties and the ultimate gain to be realized from property sales 
to the extent that inflation affects interest rates  tci s earnings from short term investments  the cost of new financings as well as the cost of variable interest rate debt will be affected

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risk tci s future operations  cash flow and fair values of financial instruments are partially dependent upon the then existing market interest rates and market equity prices 
market risk is the changes in the market rates and prices  and the effect of the changes on future operations 
market risk is managed by matching a property s anticipated net operating income to an appropriate financing 
tci is exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced 
tci does not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  but rather issues these financial instruments to finance its portfolio of real estate assets 
tci s interest rate sensitivity position is managed by tci s finance department 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
tci s earnings are affected as changes in short term interest rates impact its cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt 
a large portion of tci s market risk is exposure to short term interest rates from variable rate borrowings 
the impact on tci s financial statements of refinancing fixed debt that matured during was not material 
as permitted  management intends to convert a significant portion of those borrowings from variable rates to fixed rates in if market interest rates for variable rate debt average basis points more in than they did during  tci s interest expense would increase  and income would decrease by million 
this amount is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on tci s borrowing cost 
this analysis did not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in tci s financial structure 
the following table contains only those exposures that existed at december  anticipation of exposures or risk on positions that could possibly arise was not considered 
tci s ultimate interest rate risk and its effect on operations will depend on future capital market exposures  which cannot be anticipated with a probable assurance level
