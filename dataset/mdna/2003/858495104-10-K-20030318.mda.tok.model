item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion provides an assessment of the results of our operations and liquidity and capital resources together with a brief description of certain of our accounting policies 
accordingly  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we  through our operating subsidiaries  are one of the world s leading manufacturers of musical instruments 
our strategy is to capitalize on our strong brand names  leading market positions  strong distribution networks  and quality products 
piano segment sales of our pianos are influenced by general economic conditions  demographic trends and general interest in music and the arts 
the operating results of our piano segment are primarily affected by steinway sons grand piano sales 
given the total number of these pianos that we sell in any year  sold in  a slight change in units sold can have a material impact on our business and operating results 
our results are also influenced by sales of boston and essex pianos  which together represented approximately of total piano units sold and approximately of total piano revenues in our boston and essex piano lines are manufactured in asia  each by a single manufacturer 
the ability of these manufacturers to produce and ship products to us could materially impact our business and operating results 
in  approximately of piano sales were in the united states  in europe and the remaining primarily in asia 
for the year ended december   our piano sales were million  representing of our total revenues 
piano outlook for we expect a challenging year for our piano segment due to uncertainties in the economies worldwide  especially in europe and asia 
gross margins are expected to remain relatively stable 
the celebration of the th anniversary of steinway sons in  while increasing marketing expenses  is expected to provide us with increased public recognition and generate additional sales prospects 
we currently have sufficient  but not excessive  manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated or increased demand 
band segment our student band instrument sales are influenced by trends in school enrollment and general attitudes toward music and the arts 
management estimates that of our domestic band sales are generated through educational programs 
our school instrument business is correlated to the number of school children in the united states  which has peaked and is expected to remain relatively stable over the next few years 
however  due to the current economic climate  many school budgets have recently been reduced 
this has often adversely impacted school music program funding  resulting in delays or eliminations of beginning band programs  which has negatively impacted our revenues 
in addition  limited resources have affected the sales of instruments typically purchased by schools  such as tubas  sousaphones  and certain percussion instruments 
in addition  our band instrument sales have also been adversely affected by high levels of available inventories from domestic suppliers and an abundance of competitively priced instruments being imported from offshore  low cost producers 
as a result  we are currently competing in a highly price sensitive domestic market with excess capacity 
musical instrument dealers  our primary customers  are also focusing on selling through current inventories before ordering new instruments 
with the increase in product availability  dealers are ordering on an as needed basis instead of making substantial investments in their own inventories 
we refined our pricing structure on certain instruments in order to remain competitive in the increasingly efficient band instrument market 
consistent with past patterns  beginner instruments accounted for of band and orchestral unit shipments and of instrument revenues in  with advanced and professional instruments representing the balance 
in  approximately of band sales were in the united states  in europe and the remaining primarily in asia 
for the year ended december   our band sales were million  representing of our total revenues 
band outlook for aggressive competition  low domestic industry capacity utilization  and uncertainty regarding the outcome of our labor contract negotiations will make another challenging year for our band segment 
we intend to focus on strengthening this segment in the upcoming year by increasing our manufacturing flexibility  taking greater advantage of our available distribution channels  and refining the balance between manufactured and imported products while maintaining the high quality standards for which our brands are known 
we believe that the implementation of these strategies is necessary for the long term growth of this segment of our business 
inflation and foreign currency impact although we cannot accurately predict the precise effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on sales or results of operations in recent years 
sales to customers outside the united states represent approximately of consolidated sales  with international piano sales accounting for approximately of these international sales 
a significant portion of international piano sales originate from our german manufacturing facility  resulting in sales  cost of sales and related operating expenses denominated in euros 
while currency translation has affected international sales  cost of sales and related operating expenses  it has not had a material impact on operating income 
we utilize financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on firm and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the affected division 
we do not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management 
taxes our effective tax rates vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to us income and the absorption of foreign tax credits in the us in  a one time tax benefit associated with the reduction of deferred tax balances  caused by an enacted rate reduction in germany  lowered our effective tax rate to 
this rate change was effective on january   resulting in a reduction of our effective tax rate in germany from in to in in  the costs associated with our debt extinguishment  which were absorbed domestically  caused an increase in the proportion of our foreign source income  allowing us to utilize foreign tax credits carried forward from prior years 
in  we were not able to utilize foreign tax credits carried forward from prior years 
however  with the overall effective german rates now on par with the us rates  the shift towards income generated from the german divisions allows us to better utilize our overall foreign tax credits 
acquisitions historically  some of our growth has come from strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses 
we acquired pianohaus karl lang pkl  germany s largest retail piano store  in january  and united musical instruments holdings  inc umi  a domestic manufacturer of band and orchestral instruments  in september the following discussion includes each of these businesses since its date of acquisition 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales net sales decreased million to million in  despite a million revenue increase in the fourth quarter  which was attributable to our piano sales 
year over year  piano sales declined million to million  reflecting the decrease in shipments of our steinway grand units 
our domestic sales were less impacted by the weakened worldwide economy than our sales in europe and asia 
domestic grand unit shipments decreased only as compared to the decrease in our grand unit shipments overseas 
however  this was mitigated by the continued strong domestic demand for our lower priced boston piano lines  which experienced a domestic unit shipment increase of in the current year 
as a result  domestic piano revenues remained stable year over year 
band and orchestral instrument sales decreased million to million in this resulted from a unit decrease of and more competitive pricing strategies on certain instruments  which was partially offset by a shift in sales mix towards higher priced step up and professional instruments 
gross profit gross profit decreased million to million in gross margins declined to from in primarily as a result of a decline in our band margins  which deteriorated from in to in this was due to reduced production  which was at or below levels in virtually all of our plants  as well as manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from layoffs and staff retraining requirements at one of our plants 
piano margins decreased only slightly  to from in the prior year 
in response to the slowing economy  we applied periodic factory shutdowns in order to control inventory levels while retaining our skilled workforce 
a decrease in production days at our overseas manufacturing facility had an unfavorable impact of approximately million on our margin  but was mitigated by the favorable exchange rates on the boston product line inventories 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased million to million in  primarily due to the million decrease in our amortization expense resulting from the implementation of sfas no 
increases in general and administrative costs associated with consulting and severance costs were more than offset by the million decrease in sales and marketing expenses year over year 
non operating expenses non operating expenses decreased million to million in primarily as a result of the reclassification of million of debt extinguishment costs in the prior year 
these costs  which are attributable to our long term debt refinancing in april  have been reclassified from an extraordinary item to a non operating expense due to our implementation of sfas no 
exclusive of these costs  non operating expenses decreased million 
this was due to the million decrease in net interest expense resulting from the significant decrease in borrowings on our domestic revolving loan as compared to foreign exchange gains of million compared to foreign exchange losses of million in also contributed to the reduction of non operating expenses in the current period 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales net sales increased million to million in piano sales declined million to million  reflecting a domestic unit shipment decrease of as a result of the us economic slowdown 
however  the decrease in domestic piano sales of was partially offset by the strong performance of international piano sales  which increased million  or in band and orchestral sales increased million to million on a corresponding increase in band shipments of 
this increase was primarily due to the million of incremental revenue from umi  which more than offset the negative effect of dealer consolidation 
gross profit gross profit increased million to million in gross margins declined to from in as a result of declines in both the piano and band margins 
piano margins declined slightly  from to  despite a favorable sales mix of higher margin concert grands reported by our international piano operations 
this decline was a result of additional factory shutdowns and the lower absorption of overhead costs in domestic piano operations 
these periodic shutdowns were instituted by management in order to control inventory levels  yet retain the skilled workforce  in response to the slowing economy 
band instrument margins declined from to due to production changes at one manufacturing facility  which resulted in additional training costs and labor inefficiencies 
the incremental costs in of approximately million related to a reengineering project at certain band instrument manufacturing plants also adversely impacted gross margin 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million to million in operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly from in to in excluding the incremental operating expenses of umi of million in and the one time charges of million associated with the acquisition of umi in  operating expenses remained relatively flat 
non operating expenses other expense increased approximately million to million in this increase is primarily the result of the million of debt extinguishment costs associated with our long term debt refinancing in april  which has been reclassified from an extraordinary item to a non operating expense due to our implementation of sfas no 
the remaining increase is a result of higher net interest expense associated with higher average outstanding debt balances incurred primarily as a result of the acquisition of umi 
liquidity and capital resources we have relied primarily upon cash provided by operations  supplemented as necessary by seasonal borrowings under our working capital line  to finance our operations  repay long term indebtedness and fund our capital expenditures 
cash flows cash provided by operations was million in  million in  and million in the increase in is the result of our continued control of inventory as well as effective management of our accounts receivable and payable 
in  we embarked on a major initiative to effect fundamental changes in our band instrument manufacturing operations 
we incurred project related expenses of approximately million in  million in  and million in the long term benefits of the project include improved production flow  efficiency and quality 
cash used for the acquisitions of pkl and umi was million in cash used in other investing activities consists primarily of capital expenditures of million in  million in  and million in in  cash provided by financing activities  which totaled million  was primarily derived from borrowings on our line of credit and the million acquisition loan obtained to purchase umi 
in  cash used in financing activities totaled million and was due to a combination of factors  including our issuance of million in senior notes  our redemption of million in senior subordinated notes  and repayment of our domestic line of credit 
in  cash used for financing activities of million was due to our long term debt repayment of million and the repurchase of million of our senior notes 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures consist primarily of machinery and equipment purchases  facility upgrades in conjunction with certain epa compliance projects  and general facility improvements 
we expect our capital spending in to be in the range of million  relating to facility renovations  machinery and process improvements  and equipment replacement 
seasonality consistent with industry practice  we sell band instruments almost entirely on credit utilizing the two financing programs described below 
due to these programs  we have large working capital requirements during certain times of the year when band instrument receivable balances reach highs of approximately million in august and september  and lesser requirements when they are at lows of approximately million in january and february 
the financing options  intended to assist dealers with the seasonality inherent in the industry and to facilitate the rent to own programs offered to students by many retailers  also allow us to match our production and delivery schedules 
the following forms of financing are offered to qualified band instrument dealers a receivable dating payments on purchases made from january through august are due in october 
payments on purchases made from september to december are due in january 
dealers are offered discounts for early payment 
b note receivable financing qualified dealers may convert open accounts to a note payable to us 
the note program is offered in january and october and coincides with the receivable dating program 
in most instances  the note receivable is secured by dealer inventories and receivables 
off balance sheet arrangements prior to august  we sold notes receivable on a recourse basis to a financing company 
the financing company had the option to purchase up to million of our notes receivable 
we received proceeds from the sale of such notes of approximately million in and million in outstanding balances on these notes were million as of december  subsequent to august we have retained these notes receivable 
unlike many of our competitors in the piano industry  with limited exceptions  we do not provide extended financing arrangements to our dealers 
to facilitate long term financing required by some dealers  we have arranged financing through a third party provider 
we generally provide no guarantee with respect to these arrangements 
pensions and other postretirement benefits when determining the amounts to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to our domestic pension and other post retirement benefits  we used a long term rate of return on plan assets of  which was developed with input from our actuaries and our investment advisors  and is consistent with previous rates we have used 
during  we implemented a pension asset investment policy  conducted a review and redistribution of our investment assets in accordance with our policy  and reviewed past portfolio performance and future performance expectations for our pension assets 
we also amended one of our plans to eliminate future years of service credit under the plan 
we believe that is representative of the long term rate of return that we may expect from our domestic pension assets 
the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations for our domestic plans is based on long term bonds receiving an aa or better rating by a recognized rating agency 
the resulting discount rate decreased from to at december  the discount rates and rates of returns on plan assets for our foreign pension and other postretirement benefit plans were similarly developed utilizing long term rates of return and discount rates reasonably expected to occur 
borrowing activities and availability our real estate term loan  acquisition term loan  and domestic  seasonal borrowing requirements are accommodated through a committed credit facility with a syndicate of domestic lenders the credit facility 
the credit facility  which was amended and restated to accommodate the million bond offering completed on april   provides us with a potential borrowing capacity of million in revolving credit loans  and expires on september  borrowings are collateralized by our domestic accounts receivable  inventory  and fixed assets 
as of december   there were no revolving credit loans outstanding and availability based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances was approximately million  net of letters of credit 
the real estate term loan is payable in monthly installments of million and includes interest at average day libor at december  plus 
this term loan is secured by all of our interests in the steinway hall property 
the acquisition term loan is repayable in monthly installments of million for the first five years and monthly installments of million in years six through eight 
the acquisition term loan and revolving credit loans bear interest at average day libor plus 
all of our borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a first lien on our domestic inventory  receivables  and fixed assets 
open account loans with foreign banks also provide for borrowings of up to million million at december  by steinway s foreign subsidiaries 
on april   we completed a million senior note offering 
the proceeds of this offering were used to redeem million of previously outstanding senior subordinated notes  with the balance used to pay down the credit facility 
the early retirement of the senior subordinated notes  which were redeemed on june  at of the principal amount  generated a debt extinguishment charge of approximately million  and a related tax benefit of million 
on december  we repurchased million of our senior notes 
at december   our total outstanding indebtedness amounted to million  consisting of million of senior notes  million on the real estate term loan  million on the acquisition term loan  and million of notes payable to foreign banks 
cash interest paid was million in and million in all of our debt agreements contain covenants that place certain restrictions on us  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to make investments in other entities and to pay cash dividends 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  our share repurchase program authorizes us to make discretionary repurchases of our ordinary common stock up to a limit of million 
repurchased shares are being held as treasury shares to be used for corporate purposes 
we have reserved  shares of our existing treasury stock to be utilized for the issuance for stock options under our amended and restated stock plan 
these options will have no impact on our cash flow or number of shares outstanding unless and until the options are exercised 
in  we repurchased  shares at a cost of million 
we did not repurchase any shares in  but intend to consider repurchases in  contingent upon our cash flow  share price  and availability of shares for purchase 
we experience long production and inventory turnover cycles  which we constantly monitor  since fluctuations in demand can have a significant impact on these cycles 
in  we successfully continued to focus on managing our inventory levels and accounts receivable in order to maximize cash flow from operations 
we were once again able to eliminate the outstanding debt on the revolving portion of the credit facility by the end of the fiscal year 
looking forward to  we anticipate a challenging year 
we will continue to focus on keeping our balance sheet strong by managing accounts receivable  maintaining sufficient  but not excessive  inventory levels  and repaying debt 
other than those described  we are not aware of any trends  demands  commitments  or costs of resources that are expected to materially impact our liquidity or capital resources 
accordingly  we believe that cash on hand  together with cash flows anticipated from operations and available borrowings under the credit facility  will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements  fund continuing capital requirements and satisfy our working capital and general corporate needs through contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases other long term liabilities total notes to contractual obligations the nature of our long term debt obligations is described more fully in the borrowing availability and activities section of liquidity and capital resources 
approximately million of our operating lease obligations are attributable to the ninety nine year land lease associated with the purchase of steinway hall  which is described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this filing  the remainder is attributable to the leasing of other facilities and equipment 
our other long term liabilities consist primarily of pension obligations  which are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this filing 
critical accounting policies the nature of our business the production and sale of musical instruments is such that it rarely involves application of highly complex or subjective accounting principles 
the accounting policies that are subject to significant management estimates are those normally found in traditional businesses and include inventory reserves  accounts receivable reserves  reserves on notes receivable including recourse reserves when notes had been sold to third parties  and warranty reserves 
we have significant experience and data on which to base these estimates 
historical information is adjusted for specific uncertainties  such as new product introductions  and contemporaneous information  such as price fluctuations 
we regularly perform assessments of the underlying assumptions and believe that they provide a reasonable basis for the estimates contained in our financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements on april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which addresses  among other things  the treatment of gains and losses resulting from the early extinguishment of debt 
we adopted sfas no 
in and reclassified the components of the early extinguishment of debt recorded in to an element of non operating expenses and the income tax provision  this reclassification does not change the amount of the loss recorded nor  other than the reclassification  does it have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
on july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized when the costs are incurred  rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for disposal activities initiated after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we do not currently intend to adopt the fair value based method of measuring compensation associated with stock awards and grants 
as a consequence of continuing to utilize the intrinsic value method of measuring such compensation  we will be required in to provide additional disclosures in our quarterly financial statements  which will reflect the impact on net income and earnings per share on a pro forma basis as if we had applied the fair value method to stock based employee compensation 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by holding forward foreign currency contracts 
these contracts are used as a hedge against intercompany transactions and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   a negative change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts by approximately million 
gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts are defined as the difference between the contract rate at its inception date and the current exchange rate 
however  we would offset any such gains and losses by corresponding losses and gains  respectively  on the related hedged asset or liability 
our interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on our variable rate debt 
the credit facility and term loans bear interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in libor 
for the year ended december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately million 
we use interest rate caps to manage interest rate risk on foreign debt 
the carrying value of the caps is not material and a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the caps 
our long term debt includes million of senior notes with a fixed interest rate 
accordingly  there would be no immediate impact on our interest expense associated with these notes due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
however  based on a hypothetical immediate decrease in market interest rates  the fair value of our senior notes  which would be sensitive to such interest rate changes  would be increased by approximately million as of december  such fair value changes may affect our determination whether to retain  replace or retire these notes
