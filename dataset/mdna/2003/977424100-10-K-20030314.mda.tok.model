item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and industry  our beliefs and assumptions 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward looking statements 
forward looking statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which reflect our management s view only as of the date of this report 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
investors should carefully review the information contained in this report under the caption factors that may affect our future results and market price of our stock beginning on page overview we provide the contact center market an integrated performance optimization software suite that enables global enterprises to capture customer intelligence and optimize workforce performance 
our solution is comprised of business driven multimedia recording  performance analysis and e learning management applications that are designed to enhance the quality of customer interactions across multiple communications media  including the telephone  e mail and the internet 
our enterprise collaboration architecture allows contact center management to share information gathered in the contact center with departments that touch the customer  as well as executives throughout the organization 
an integrated business consulting  installation and training methodology provides services to support an effective  rapid deployment of our software that enables organizations to maximize their return on investment 
our software is designed to integrate with a variety of third party software applications  such as customer relationship management crm and enterprise resource planning applications  and with existing telephony and computer network hardware and software 
the majority of our customers are companies with one or more contact centers that handle voice and data customer interactions for outbound sales and marketing operations  inbound service support lines  or both 
during  many of our prospects and customers continued to defer projects and or extended their software purchasing processes  resulting in our license revenue being less than our license revenue in although services revenue for increased compared to the prior year  services revenue was impacted by customers deferring installations due to their own lack of resources and budget uncertainties  as well as increased pricing pressures for maintenance renewals 
the length of our collections cycle has been adversely impacted by the increase in international revenues and by the weakened economy  resulting in our customers deferring payments to us or requiring payment terms longer than those normally provided by us 
as a result of these economic conditions  our ability to forecast future license and services revenues has become more difficult 
if the economy continues to deteriorate  the level of corporate spending for information technology and crm applications may further decline 
such declines could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
sources of revenue and revenue recognition policy we derive our revenue from licensing our software and providing related services 
we primarily utilize a direct sales organization and an indirect sales channel that consists of select resellers and a variety of strategic marketing alliances to reach our target customer base 
prior to  less than of our license revenue had been derived from our indirect sales channel rather than from our direct sales force 
for the year ended december   of our license revenue was derived from our indirect sales channel 
we expect the proportion of license revenue derived from our indirect sales channel to continue to increase in the future as we expand internationally  where we derive a greater portion of our revenue through our indirect sales channel 
during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from customers outside the united states and canada 
we expect the proportion of future revenue derived from international markets to continue to increase and may be denominated in the currency of the applicable market 
license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
we recognize license revenue using the residual method whereby revenue is recognized in a multiple element arrangement when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement  but does not for one of the delivered elements in the arrangement 
we defer revenue for the fair value of its undelivered elements  normally services and maintenance  and recognize license revenue for the remainder of the total arrangement fee 
our license agreements generally provide that customers pay a software license fee for one or more software products for a specified number of users 
the amount of the license fee varies based on which product is licensed  the number of software products licensed  the number of installation sites and the number of users licensed 
customers can subsequently pay additional license fees to allow additional users to use previously licensed software products or to license additional software products 
each software product contains common components  allowing for easy integration of additional software products as they are licensed from us 
customers that license our software products usually receive the software on compact disc 
services revenue includes installation  training  consulting  maintenance and reimbursable travel expenses 
revenue from installation  training and consulting services is recognized upon performance of the related services 
revenue from reimbursable travel expenses is recognized upon incurrence of the related expenses 
services are traditionally offered and billed as separate elements of contracts on either a fixed service fee plus travel expenses or on a time and materials basis 
the functionality of the software is not dependent on these services 
maintenance is offered as a separate element and includes the right to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis 
maintenance revenue  which is generally billed annually in advance  is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the related contract 
specified upgrades are not typically offered to customers 
historically  all customers have purchased an initial maintenance contract for each newly licensed site 
during  and  approximately of active customer installation sites renewed their annual maintenance contracts 
effective january   we adopted the emerging issues task force s eitf no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which requires companies to characterize reimbursements received for travel expenses incurred as revenue in the statement of operations 
we had historically recorded reimbursements as a reduction of services cost of revenue 
in accordance with eitf no 
 we reclassified  and  of reimbursable travel expenses to services revenue from cost of services revenue resulting in no change to gross profit for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profit margins decreased to and in and  respectively  from and  respectively  after the effect of eitf no 
cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of license revenue primarily consists of royalties due to third parties and packaging costs 
cost of services revenue for installation  training  consulting and maintenance services includes personnel costs and related expenses and allocated overhead 
personnel costs include salaries  bonuses and benefits 
we classify all charges to the operating expense categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
allocated overhead include rent for corporate offices and furniture  communication charges and depreciation and amortization expenses for office equipment and leasehold improvements 
we allocate these costs to each of the functional areas based on use 
operating expenses are classified into three general categories sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  sales commissions  promotional expenses  public relations  tradeshows  travel expenses and allocated overhead 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and consulting costs to support product development  and allocated overhead 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
historically  software development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established have not been material and  therefore  have been charged to expense 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for accounting and finance  information technology  human resources and legal  as well as provisions for allowance for doubtful accounts and allocated overhead 
we had full time employees at december   compared to at december  and at december  we anticipate that total operating expenses will increase over time as we globally expand our sales and marketing operations  develop new distribution channels  fund ongoing research and development  broaden professional services offerings  improve operational and financial systems and support our growth internationally 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  research and development and software development costs  allowance for deferred tax assets and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this forms the basis of judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
factors that could affect our future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include  but are not limited to  lower than anticipated growth from existing customers  our ability to attract new customers and grow internationally  our ability to grow through acquisitions and to successfully integrate acquisitions  the availability and cost of debt and equity financing  technology changes  or a decline in the financial stability of our customers 
negative developments in these or other risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
a summary of our critical accounting policies follows 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenues are a key component of our results of operations 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in measuring revenues  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
further  assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether or not revenues should be recognized in the current market environment 
we also record provisions for estimated sales allowances on product and service related revenues in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales and services allowances  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if future sales credits prove to be greater than the historical data and management estimates we used to calculate these estimates  revenues could be overstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and continuously monitor collections and payments and estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a percentage of our accounts receivable  our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and we believe appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot assure that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past or adequately predict future credit losses 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination is made 
research and development and software development costs 
we evaluate the establishment of technological feasibility of our products in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we sell products in a market that is subject to rapid technological change  new product development and changing customer needs  accordingly  we have concluded that technological feasibility is not established until the completion of a working model 
historically  software development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established have not been material 
therefore  we charge all such costs to research and development expense in the period incurred 
allowance for deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
to the extent that future taxable income is generated and considered more likely than not to continue in the future an adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance would be made  increasing net income in the period in which such determination was made 
stock based compensation 
with the exception of the deferred stock compensation that we recorded at our initial public offering ipo  we generally do not record compensation expense for options granted to our employees because all options granted under our stock option plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
as permitted under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we have elected to continue to apply the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and have adopted only the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
had we determined compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant date for our stock options and purchase rights under sfas no 
 our net income loss would have been the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands  except per share data year ended december  historical net income loss   add stock based employee compensation deduct total stock based compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards    pro forma net loss    pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share results of operations the table below shows operating data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  statement of operations data revenue license services total revenue cost of revenue license services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquired in process research and development operating loss interest and other income  net income loss before provision for income taxes and extraordinary loss provision for income taxes income loss before extraordinary loss extraordinary loss net income loss revenue total revenue increased in to million due to an increase in services revenue 
the number of installed customer sites grew to  sites at the end of from sites at the end of total revenue increased in to million from million in due to an increase in license and services revenue 
this revenue growth was attributable to increases in international revenue  the addition of new products and services  and the increasing recurring maintenance revenue stream 
the number of installed customer sites grew to sites at the end of from sites at the end of license revenue decreased in to million due to fewer contracts signed by customers during  which we believe was attributable to a reduction in the level of corporate spending for information technology partially offset by an increase in the number of products licensed within our software product suite 
the decrease in license revenue as a percentage of total revenue was also a result of increased services revenue  as discussed below 
license revenue increased in to million from million in due to an increase in the number contracts signed by customers during during  and   and  respectively  of license revenue was attributable to new customers compared to follow on revenue from our existing customer base 
we receive follow on revenue from our customers when they purchase additional user licenses or license additional applications at existing sites and when they license our products at new sites 
services revenue  consisting of installation  training  consulting  maintenance revenue and reimbursable travel expenses  increased to million in and in to million from million in these increases were attributable to increases in maintenance and professional services revenue 
the growth in maintenance revenue resulted from the growth in our customer base as well as increased renewal amounts charged for annual maintenance contracts from existing customer sites 
although maintenance revenue increased in  some customers resisted price increases for maintenance renewal amounts due to a weakened economy 
installation  training and consulting revenue increased in and in due to overall increased services revenue per customer site and the addition of new consulting services offerings 
services revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased due to the compounding effect of maintenance revenue from both new customer sites and renewals of maintenance contracts from existing customer sites and  to a lesser extent  from the decrease in license revenue from to we expect services revenue in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue to continue to increase over time due to the compounding effect of renewals of annual maintenance contracts from existing customer sites and increased business consulting services offered around our expanded product suite 
cost of revenue total cost of revenue increased to million in and in to million from million in gross profit margins decreased or remained constant at in from in and in the decrease in gross profit margin was attributable to a greater percentage of revenue in generated from services  which has a lower margin than license revenue 
the increased gross profit margins in were driven by improved services margins that resulted primarily from the increase in maintenance services revenue 
we expect gross profit margins to decrease slightly over time as a greater percentage of our revenue is generated from services revenue  which has a lower gross margin than license revenue 
cost of license revenue increased to million in and in to  from  in these increases were primarily attributable to license fees associated with third party software components that are embedded in our software applications 
as we develop upgrades of our existing products and add new offerings to our product suite we often embed third party technology into our software 
as a result  we expect cost of license revenue as a percentage of total revenue to increase over time as a greater proportion of revenue is derived from software applications containing embedded technologies 
cost of services revenue increased to million in and in to million from million in these increases were primarily a result of an increase in the number of employees and contractors engaged in consulting and customer maintenance services 
cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue decreased to in from in and from in these improvements were due primarily to the increased services revenue per customer site as well as improved profit margins in the consulting and maintenance services group due to the increase in consulting and maintenance revenue 
we anticipate that the cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue will decrease over time as we increase our business consulting service offerings and increase our maintenance customer base 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses remained fairly constant in at million from million in however  as a percentage of total revenue  sales and marketing expenses decreased due to a redirection of certain discretionary marketing spending in sales and marketing expenses increased in to million from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing personnel costs  marketing programs  facilities expenses and the establishment of additional sales offices in europe  asia pacific and latin america 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenue over time in conjunction with anticipated revenue growth 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in and in to million from million in these increases were due primarily to an increased number of employees and consultants engaged in research and development activities 
as a percentage of total revenue  we expect research and development expenses to remain fairly constant in the near future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in due to cost saving measures implemented during the year as well as a decrease in the provision for bad debt expense in resulting from collections in that were significantly reserved for during the latter part of as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased during general and administrative expenses increased in to million from million in primarily due to an increased provision for bad debt expense  increased corporate expenses in the executive  finance and administrative functions to support a larger organization  and increased facilities expense due to a larger headquarters facility 
we expect general and administrative expenses overall and as a percentage of total revenue to increase slightly in the near future due to increased legal  professional and insurance costs associated with the implementation of the sarbanes oxley act 
during  we adopted a plan to relocate our corporate headquarters to a larger facility within the atlanta metropolitan area 
in accordance with the eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  we estimated that the net costs associated with our then existing facilities  which were under noncancellable leases expiring on june   would be approximately  we recorded this obligation during the second quarter of during  two of the sublessees were unable to fulfill their obligations and the subleases were terminated 
as a result  we recorded an additional obligation of  in for the additional estimated loss 
as of december   there were no remaining obligations 
during  we incurred a deferred stock compensation charge of million for the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of certain stock option grants 
this charge is being amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options  generally four years 
deferred stock compensation was   and  in  and  respectively  and has been classified into the respective department functional areas 
in process research and development and related charges 
during  we entered into an option agreement to purchase in process research and development ipr d technology which had a carrying value of  in march  we paid million to exercise this option to purchase the underlying technology 
also  during the first quarter of  we purchased additional ipr d technology for million relating to similar development projects 
these projects were successfully completed by the end of during the second quarter of  we purchased software based ipr d technology relating to the development of on line analytical processing and multi dimensional analysis capabilities for million 
this project was successfully completed by june  at the date of the aforementioned transactions  the acquired ipr d technologies had not progressed to a stage where they met technological feasibility as defined by sfas no 
at the time of each transaction  we estimated the stage of completion of the project and the time and resources required to complete the project by creating a product design plan and evaluating the progress of the acquired technology towards this plan 
a significant amount of uncertainty existed as to our ability to complete the development projects within a timeframe acceptable to the market  and failure to do so would have caused our competitive position in the market to erode 
additionally  the amount of development required to enable the acquired technology to integrate with our primary product was estimated to be significant  which increased the uncertainty surrounding its successful development 
the acquired technologies did not have alternative future uses 
as a result of the above  we recorded charges totaling million in for acquired ipr d 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on funds available for investment  net of foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
interest and other income  net decreased to million in due to lower yields 
interest and other income  net decreased in to million from million in due to lower yields and lower investment balances 
provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for federal alternative minimum tax and foreign income tax in and a provision for state income tax  federal alternative minimum tax and foreign income tax in prior to  no provision for federal  state or foreign income taxes was recorded  primarily due to net operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are normally recognized for deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets generated as a result of net operating loss carryforwards aggregating million for us tax purposes and million for foreign tax purposes at december   as the future realization of the tax benefits is not currently considered more likely than not 
quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the last eight quarters in the period ended december   as well as the percentage of total revenue represented by each item 
the information has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared on substantially the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider to be necessary to present fairly this information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report

services revenue as a percentage of total revenue generally increased during and due to the increased maintenance customer base and the expansion of our service offerings 
we expect that services revenue will continue to grow relative to license revenue throughout gross profit margins decreased from quarter to quarter during due to license fees associated with third party software components that are embedded in our software applications sold in and the increased percentage of revenue from services 
we expect gross profit margins to decrease slightly over time as a greater percentage of our revenue is generated from services revenue  which has a lower margin than license revenue 
total operating expenses in and  excluding the acquired ipr d  have been relatively stable  varying largely with quarterly license revenue  as we attempted to control our cost structure in light of the economic uncertainty and continued deterioration in the economy 
our quarterly operating results  particularly license revenue  have experienced significant fluctuations in the past and we expect that this pattern will continue in the future 
for instance  quarterly results may fluctuate based on the timing of sales due to customer calendar year budgeting cycles  slow summer purchasing patterns and compensation policies that tend to compensate sales personnel  typically in the latter half of the year  for achieving annual quotas 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of results are not necessarily meaningful  and such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources we generated million in cash flows from operating activities in compared to cash used in operating activities of million in and million in this increase in cash flow from operations was due primarily to the million cash paid for ipr d during and the reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue during net cash flows provided by investing activities was million in compared to cash used in investing activities of million in and million in these variances were primarily due to the release of our restricted cash in and the investment of the net proceeds received from our ipo in capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively  were primarily for computer equipment and leasehold improvements 
net cash flows used in financing activities in were million compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of million in and million in the use of cash from financing activities in was due to our stock repurchases which began in the fourth quarter of  which more than offset the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases 
overall  up to million of stock repurchases have been authorized 
the decrease in cash flows from financing activities in was due to the receipt in of the net proceeds received from our ipo 
at december   we had million in working capital  which included million in cash and cash equivalents and investments 
in  we increased our existing line of credit to million and extended its maturity date to november at our discretion  borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate  which was on december   or libor plus basis points 
the revolving line of credit is secured by all of our assets and requires compliance with various covenants  including liquidity ratios and tangible net worth requirements  among others 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit are limited to of eligible accounts receivable  as defined by the agreement 
in  we also caused our bank to issue irrevocable standby letters of credit under this facility to secure the lease on the corporate headquarters facility which relieved our restricted cash 
the letter of credit requirements of the leases have decreasing schedules that ultimately expire in the amount available under the line of credit at december  was million  which was net of the outstanding letters of credit of million 
as of december   we had not borrowed any funds under the line of credit 
in february  we entered into a cash purchase agreement with eyretel plc eyretel for million see subsequent event 
in february  we borrowed million under the line of credit at the bank s prime rate of for short term working capital purposes as we pursue the eyretel acquisition 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures will increase over the next several years as we acquire equipment to support the expansion of our research and development activities and internal management information systems 
we expect to continue to experience growth in our operating expenses 
we anticipate that operating expenses and planned capital expenditures will continue to be a material use of our cash resources 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments and our line of credit will be more than sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next months 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or establish new financing arrangements 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot assure that any financing arrangements will be available in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
our accounts receivable days sales outstanding decreased to days for the fourth quarter of from days for the fourth quarter of we expect our days sales outstanding to increase as we derive a greater proportion of our revenue from international operations where payment is typically slower than in the united states  and due to an increase in the number of customers with extended payment terms or deferring payments  which we believe can be attributed to a weakened economy 
we expect our days sales outstanding to be in the high s range in the future 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in interest rates of investment grade securities 
to reduce our balance sheet exposure to variations in asset values  our investment policy guidelines specify that we invest in the highest investment grade securities and maintain a weighted average maturity of nine months for our entire portfolio 
our investment portfolio may contain securities with maturities of up to three years 
while this minimizes our interest rate risk to asset values  our results are exposed to fluctuations in interest income due to changes in market rates 
the majority of our operations are based in the united states and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have offices in australia  brazil  canada  india  japan  mexico  the netherlands  singapore and the united kingdom and conduct transactions in either the local currency of the location or in us dollars 
to date  the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of other currencies has not been material 
net foreign exchange gains and losses were   and  in  and  respectively 
our future contractual obligations include minimum lease payments under operating leases at december   and are as follows in thousands december  thereafter as of december   we did not have any other contractual commitments or off balance sheet arrangements 
transactions with management during  notes receivable due from certain officers totaling  were satisfied by delivering  at current fair market value  shares of our common stock  which such employees had held for longer than six months 
in february  the notes receivable from our chief executive officer ceo totaling million were refinanced in part with a full recourse note the note for approximately million with floating monthly interest of basis points over the federal funds rate 
the note is payable in three equal payments of principal and interest due annually through february the remaining balance was satisfied by the ceo delivering  at current fair market value  shares of our common stock  which he had held for more than six months 
during the fourth quarter of  the value of the underlying shares of our common stock held as collateral did not meet the collateral maintenance requirements of the note 
our board of directors delivered to the ceo a notice of forbearance  advising the ceo that  for the time being  witness will forbear pursuit of its rights to demand additional collateral or prepayment of the note 
however  witness did not waive  release or relinquish its right to exercise any and all of its rights or remedies at that time or in the future 
this action is not expected to affect our results of operations or financial position 
the ceo paid the first of the three installments in february recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas no 
s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
does not require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method but does amend the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure in both the annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  we do not intend to adopt sfas no 
s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation but have included the disclosures required by sfas no 
in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which clarifies disclosure and recognition measurement requirements related to certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after december  and the recognition measurement requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  we typically grant our customers a standard warranty term which guarantees that our products will substantially conform to our current specifications 
we may also indemnify our customers from third party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to the use of our products 
costs related to these guarantees have not been significant and we do not believe that these guarantees will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
under the new rules  a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity must only be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under the previous guidance of eitf no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
this sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
prior to the issuance of sfas no 
 sfas no 
had required that all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt were to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
sfas no 
rescinds sfas no 
and the related required classification of extraordinary items 
this sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
subsequent event on february   we announced that we had reached an agreement with eyretel  a uk based provider of compliance and recording solutions for customer contact centers  on the terms of a recommended cash offer for all of the shares of eyretel 
the offer was for pence in cash for each eyretel share and values the company s entire issued share capital at approximately million or million 
we purchased of eyretel on february  and we commenced the recommended cash offer for all of the shares of eyretel on february  by publishing the uk offer document and a form of election and authority in accordance with the requirements of eyretel s home jurisdiction 
the total cash consideration for the offer will be financed from our existing cash and investments 
the acquisition is intended to extend our leadership in the global contact center performance optimization market  offering customers a comprehensive range of software and services 
the acquisition has been recommended by the board of directors of eyretel and is subject to the successful closing of the offer and to customary conditions  including regulatory and other standard approvals 
the acquisition is expected to be completed in march or april of factors that may affect our future results and market price of our stock our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future  and an investment in our common stock is subject to a variety of risks  including but not limited to the specific risks identified below 
inevitably  some investors in our securities will experience gains while others will experience losses depending on the prices at which they purchase and sell securities 
prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this report and the other documents we file with the sec 
important factors currently known to our management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements include the disclosures contained in this report and the other documents we file with the sec  as well as the following risks our software has a long sales cycle that makes it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results although it typically takes three to six months from the time we qualify a sales lead until we sign a contract with the customer  we occasionally experience a longer sales cycle 
this was the case in  and may be the case in future periods 
it is therefore difficult to predict the quarter in which a particular sale will occur 
if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens for one or more large orders or a significant number of small orders  it would adversely affect the timing of our revenue and the timing of our corresponding expenditures 
this could harm our ability to meet our financial forecasts for a given quarter 
our customers decisions regarding their purchase of our software and services is relatively long due to several factors  including the complex nature of our software  our need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our software  competition for a shrinking amount of corporate resources because of a slowing economy  the investment of money and other resources required by customers to purchase and implement our software  customers budget cycles and operating activities  which affect the timing of their purchases  the competitive evaluation and internal approval process many of our customers undertake before purchasing our software and services  delayed purchases due to announcements or planned introductions of new software or software enhancements by us or our competitors  and the length of time some of our larger customers require to make a decision to purchase our software and services 
if the market in which we sell our software and services deteriorates further as a result of declining economic conditions and or consolidations  it will have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations the market for customer relationship management software  including software that records and analyzes customer interactions  is still emerging 
however  recent economic conditions and uncertainties have caused many of our customers and prospective customers to postpone capital expenditures and many have experienced severe financial difficulties 
some examples include worldcom  adelphia and usair 
consequently  this has caused an adverse effect on our business and results of operations during and it is expected that these financial difficulties and consolidations experienced by our customers might adversely affect our business and results of operations during in addition  since our customers control the timing of our installation and training services  our services revenues have been  and may continue to be  adversely impacted as customers delay the scheduling of services 
in addition to the aforementioned  demand for our software remains uncertain because our existing and potential customers may not understand the benefits of using customer relationship management software generally or  more specifically  software which records and analyzes the interactions between a business and its customers  not achieve favorable results using this software  experience technical difficulty in implementing this software  use alternative methods such as online self help to solve the same business problems this software is intended to address  or close contact centers 
if the market for our software declines  it will have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
although we achieved a quarterly operating profit earlier in  we may continue to experience quarterly losses from operations in the future we achieved a quarterly operating profit in the first and second quarters of we incurred losses in the third and fourth quarters of and substantial losses before we may continue to suffer losses in the future 
as a result of our operating losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  in addition  we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  professional services  and sales and marketing activities 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenue to sustain profitability in any future period 
if we do not achieve profitability from operations  or if we do not remain profitable on a net basis  we may need to obtain additional financing 
the financing from other sources upon which we have historically relied may not be available to us on acceptable terms 
if we fail to remain profitable  it will materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock 
our quarterly revenue  expenses and operating results have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate  which may cause our stock price to decline our quarterly revenue  expenses and operating results could vary significantly from period to period 
with respect to the current fiscal year  this is discussed above under the heading overview 
in particular  we derive a significant portion of our software license revenue in each quarter from a small number of relatively large orders 
a delay in the recognition of revenue from one of these orders may cause our results of operations during a quarter to be lower than we expect 
the delay or failure to close anticipated sales in a particular quarter could reduce our revenue in that quarter and subsequent quarters over which revenue for the sale could be recognized 
in addition  because our revenue from installation  maintenance and training services largely correlates with our license revenue  a decline in license revenue could also cause a decline in our services revenue in the same quarter or in subsequent quarters 
our revenue  expenses and operating results may vary significantly in response to the risk factors described in this section  as well as the following factors  some of which are beyond our control a decrease in demand for our software or  more generally  for products that record and analyze the interactions between a business and its customers and or provide electronic learning  due to either purchasing trends or general economic conditions  announcements or introductions of new products and services by our competitors  pricing for competitive products  the timely payment of fees due to us by our customers  our ability to develop  market and manage new software  software enhancements and services  the deferral of orders for our software or delays in the installation of our software from one quarter to a later quarter  how quickly we are able to develop new software  software enhancements and services that our customers require  how much money we have to spend to improve our software  services and operations  delays in installations of our software  the increasing length of sales cycles for our software  the mix of revenue generated by software licenses and related services  spending limitations imposed on our customers or potential customers because of economic factors and decreased capital spending budgets  including limitations imposed after the sales cycle has begun but before a sale is consummated  the timing and size of our capital expenditures and changes in our working capital  the failure of our customers to renew their annual maintenance  either because they consolidate their contact centers or they stop using our product company wide  the economic conditions of the companies within the financial services and telecommunications industry verticals into which we have historically sold and expect to sell our software  how successfully our reseller partners are able to resell our software  and how successful we are in selling our products in new geographic markets 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance  and you should not rely on them to predict our future performance or the future performance of our stock price 
historically  our quarterly revenue variations have fluctuated from as low as an decline to as high as a growth from one quarter to the next 
if our future revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
seasonal trends in sales of business software or customer interaction levels may affect our quarterly revenue the market for business software has experienced seasonal fluctuations in demand 
the first and third quarters of the year have been typically characterized by slightly longer sales cycles related to holiday and vacation schedules 
we believe that these fluctuations are caused in part by customer buying patterns  which are influenced by year end budgetary pressures and by sales force commission structures 
customer interaction centers typically experience much higher volumes of customer contact during and immediately following the year end holiday season 
as a result  many customers may elect to defer installation of our software during this time 
this has caused us to experience  and we expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in our revenue 
if we fail to expand and manage our international operations  we may be unable to reach or maintain our desired levels of revenue or profitability revenue from customers located outside of north america  including the united states and canada  accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for years ended december  and  respectively 
we intend to continue to expand our international operations through acquisitions  internal business expansion and strategic business relationships 
our operations outside of north america at december  consisted of dedicated employees located in australia  japan  mexico  the netherlands  singapore and the united kingdom 
we have also established relationships with a small number of international resellers 
on february   we announced a recommended offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of eyretel  a company located in the united kingdom 
if we successfully complete this pending acquisition  we expect that we will expand our international operations significantly 
in addition to general risks associated with international expansion  such as foreign currency fluctuations and political and economic instability  our plans to expand internationally may be adversely affected by a number of risks  including limited development of an international market for our software and services  the challenges we face in expanding and training our international sales force and support operations  expenses associated with customizing products for multiple countries  longer payment cycles  different accounting procedures and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  and multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations governing intellectual property  call monitoring and the recording of employees 
as we further expand our operations outside the united states  we will face new competitors and competitive environments 
in addition to the risks associated with our domestic competitors  foreign competitors may pose an even greater risk  as they may possess a better understanding of their local markets and better working relationships with local infrastructure providers and others 
in particular  because telephone protocols and standards are unique to each country  local competitors will have more experience with  and may have a competitive advantage in  these markets 
we may not be able to obtain similar levels of local knowledge or similar relationships in foreign markets  which could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage 
in addition  we have limited experience in developing local language versions of our products or in marketing our products to international customers 
we may not be able to successfully translate  market  sell  and deliver our products internationally 
conducting business internationally poses risks that could affect our financial results conducting business outside north america poses many risks that could adversely affect our operating results 
in particular  we may experience gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  for which hedging activities may not adequately protect us 
moreover  exchange rate risks can have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products in foreign markets 
where we sell our products in us dollars  our sales could be adversely affected by declines in foreign currencies relative to the dollar  thereby making our products more expensive in local currencies 
where we sell our products in local currencies  we could be competitively unable to increase our prices to reflect fluctuations in the exchange rate 
additional risks we face in conducting business internationally include the following longer payment cycles  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  and the adverse effects of tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions that impair trade 
we face intense competition that could adversely affect our revenue  profitability and market share the market for products that record customer interactions  analyze performance and or provide electronic learning is intensely competitive  evolving and experiences rapid changes in technology 
we believe our principal competitors include  but are not limited to quality monitoring suppliers to the contact center industry  traditional call logging vendors  electronic learning vendors  business analytics vendors  systems integrators and consulting firms  and new  larger and more established entities that may acquire  invest in or form joint ventures with providers of recording or performance enhancing software solutions 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  more established business relationships  larger customer bases  a broader range of products and services  greater name recognition and substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  personnel  management  service  support and other resources than we do 
this could allow our current and potential competitors to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  take better advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services and adopt more aggressive pricing policies 
these competitors may distinguish themselves from us on the basis of their longer operating histories and ability to withstand difficult economic conditions 
our competitors may also be able to offer products at lower prices or with other incentives that we cannot match 
additionally  the scope of our products and services may be viewed as too narrow because some of our competitors offer a broader range of products and services 
in addition  many of our competitors market their products through resellers and companies that integrate their technology and products with those of the competitor 
these resellers and technology partners of our competitors often have strong business relationships with our customers and potential customers 
for example  some of our competitors have a better and more long standing relationship with telephone switch vendors 
our competitors may use these business relationships to market and sell their products and compete for customers with us 
we cannot assure you that our competitors will not offer or develop products and services that are superior to ours 
in addition  it is possible that resellers or technology partners  such as certain telephone switch vendors  may acquire one or more of our competitors  which would further solidify their business relationships 
we have developed  and intend to continue to develop  relationships with companies that resell our software and companies that provide us with customer referrals or leads  some of which may become competitors 
license revenue from our indirect sales channel  which consists of select resellers and a variety of strategic marketing alliances  accounted for approximately and of our license revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect revenue from our indirect sales channel  and accordingly our dependence on resellers  to continue to increase as we establish more relationships with companies to resell our software worldwide 
we engage in joint marketing and sales efforts with our resellers  and rely on them for recommendations of our software during the evaluation stage of the purchase process 
when we enter into agreements with these companies  the agreements are not exclusive and may ordinarily be terminated by either party 
some of these companies have similar  and often more established  relationships with our competitors  and may recommend the products and services of our competitors to customers instead of our software and services 
in addition  through their relationships with us  these companies could learn about our software and the market for our software and services and could develop and sell competing products and services 
as a result  our relationships with these companies could lead to increased competition for us 
we expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter our market and as new products  services and technologies are introduced 
increased competition may result in price reductions  lower gross margins and loss of our market share 
this could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely heavily on sales of our equality balance and equality evaluation software our financial performance has depended  and will continue to depend  on our ability to develop and maintain market acceptance of our equality balance software and new and enhanced versions of it 
historically  nearly all of our license revenue has been derived from the sale of our equality balance and equality evaluation software  and we expect revenue from these two products to continue to account for most of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
through december   we have recognized less than of our license revenue from products other than equality balance and equality evaluation 
as a result  factors which adversely affect the pricing or demand for our equality balance and equality evaluation software  such as competitive pressures  technological change or evolution in customer preferences  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of these factors are beyond our control and difficult to predict 
if we fail to develop new software or improve our existing software to meet or adapt to the changing needs and standards of our target market  sales of our software and services may decline our future success depends upon our ability to develop and introduce new software and software enhancements which meet the needs of companies seeking to record and analyze their interactions with customers and or deliver electronic learning to their employees 
to achieve increased market acceptance of our software and services  we must  among other things  continue to improve our existing software and introduce new software solutions  incorporate new technology into our software and services on a timely and cost effective basis  keep pace with the products and services of our competitors  satisfy the changing requirements of our current and potential customers  improve the effectiveness of our software  particularly in installations involving very large databases and large numbers of simultaneous users  enhance our software s ease of administration  improve our software s ability to extract data from existing software systems  and adapt to rapidly changing computer operating system  database and software platform standards and internet technology 
we may require substantial product development expenditures and lead time to keep pace and ensure compatibility with new technology in our industry 
if we fail to develop and introduce new software and enhancements for our existing software  our software and services may not achieve market acceptance and we may be unable to attract new customers 
our products may fail to perform properly  which may cause us to incur additional expenses or lose sales our software is used in a complex operating environment that requires its integration with computer and telephone networks and other business software applications 
furthermore  the hardware  software and network systems generally used in conjunction with our software  particularly telephone standards and protocols  change rapidly 
the evolution of these standards may cause our products to function slowly or improperly 
poor product performance may necessitate redevelopment of our product or other costly reengineering measures which may divert our management and product development resources and funds 
due to the large number of  and variations in  computer and telephone network systems and applications  as well as the rapid changes in these products  our testing process may be unable to duplicate all possible environments in which our software is expected to perform 
any errors or defects that are discovered after we release new or enhanced software could cause us to lose revenue  cause a delay in the market acceptance of our software  damage our customer relationships and reputation and increase our service and warranty costs 
all of these problems could be exacerbated as we move our product to the latest software technologies and platforms 
our failure to protect our intellectual property may lead to third parties using our technology for their own benefit our success depends to a significant degree upon the legal protection of our software and other proprietary technology rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with employees and third parties to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
these measures may not be sufficient to protect our proprietary rights  and we cannot be certain that third parties will not misappropriate our technology and use it for their own benefit 
also  most of these protections do not preclude our competitors from independently developing products with functionality or features substantially equivalent or superior to our software 
any failure to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as of december   we had five us registered trademarks  two patents generally relating to our voice data synchronization technology and data capture technique and patent applications pending 
there is no guarantee that our pending applications will result in issued patents or  if issued  that they will provide us with any competitive advantages 
we cannot assure you that we will file further patent  trademark or copyright applications  that any future applications will be approved  that any existing or future patents  trademarks or copyrights will adequately protect our intellectual property or that any existing or future patents  trademarks or copyrights will not be challenged by third parties 
furthermore  one or more of our existing or future patents  trademarks or copyrights may be found to be invalid or unenforceable 
we are aware of certain uses  us trademark registrations  and us trademark applications for our equality trademark and its variations that predate our use  and the april  issuance  of the us registration for our trademark equality 
it is possible that the owner of legal rights resulting from one or more of these prior uses  us trademark registrations  or us trademark applications will bring legal action to challenge our registration of and or our continued use of the trademark equality  and may also seek compensation for damages resulting from our use of our registered trademark if such challenging party prevails on such a claim 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our registration of this trademark will be undisturbed  or that this use will not result in liability for trademark infringement  trademark dilution  and or unfair competition 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 
if we resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive  would likely divert valuable management and product development resources and could involve a high degree of risk  regardless of whether we win or lose the litigation 
claims by other companies that our software infringes their intellectual property could require us to incur substantial expenses or prevent us from selling our software or services if any of our software violates the intellectual property rights of others  we may be required to reengineer or redevelop our software  seek to obtain licenses from third parties to continue offering our software without substantial reengineering  or conduct studies of such intellectual property rights so as to evaluate whether such intellectual property rights are valid or enforceable 
any efforts to reengineer our software or obtain licenses from third parties may not be successful  could be extremely costly and would likely divert valuable management and product development resources 
our efforts to study the intellectual property rights of third parties may not be successful and could reveal that such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable  could be extremely costly and would likely divert valuable management and product development resources 
for example  depending on the outcome of our lawsuit against knowlagent as described above under the heading legal proceedings  we may be required to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms  required to stop selling or to redesign our equality now application  or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers 
in addition  in the rapidly developing technological environment in which we operate  third parties may have filed a number of patent applications  many of which are confidential when filed 
if our software is found to violate these patents when they are issued or any other intellectual property of others  we may become subject to claims for infringement 
an infringement claim against us could result in the loss of our proprietary rights and  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation or require us to pay damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements on terms that are unfavorable to us 
royalty or licensing agreements might not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  our customers may become subject to claims if the software they license from us is alleged to infringe the intellectual property of others 
if we decide to  or are forced to  litigate any of these claims  the litigation could be expensive and time consuming  could divert our management s attention from other matters  and could otherwise materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
litigation and intellectual property claims against us could also disrupt our sale of software 
additionally  it could lead to claims by third parties against our customers and others using our software 
our customers and these other users of our software would likely hold us responsible for these claims and any resulting harm they suffer 
we expect that we and other participants in our industry and related industries will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of competitors with patent and other intellectual property portfolios in these industries grows 
although patent and intellectual property disputes may be settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and we cannot assure you that necessary licenses or similar arrangements will be made available to us on a reasonable basis or at all 
consequently  if we become subject to an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or we fail to obtain necessary licenses it could prevent us from producing and selling some or potentially all of the components of our software 
this would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that our future success also depends upon the continued ability of our software to be compatible with the products and other technologies offered by other software and hardware companies our software must integrate with software and hardware solutions provided by a number of our existing and potential competitors 
these competitors or their business partners could alter their products so that our software no longer integrates well with them  or they could delay or deny our access to software releases that allow us to timely adapt our software to integrate with their products 
they could thus effectively prevent us from modifying our software to keep pace with the changing technology of their products 
if we cannot adapt our software to changes in our competitors technology  it may significantly impair our ability to compete effectively  particularly if our software must integrate with the software and hardware solutions of our competitors 
new products may not be compatible with our software  but may be compatible with the products of our competitors 
for example  our products must integrate with phone switches made by the telephone switch vendors  and computer telephony software applications offered by other software providers 
if our products are not compatible with the new technologies offered by other software and hardware companies  it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if we do not continue to expand the distribution of our products through direct and indirect sales channels  we may be unable to expand our market share or increase our revenue to expand our market share and revenue  attract new customers and increase sales to existing customers  we may need to expand our direct and indirect sales channels of distribution 
we also may need to expand our direct sales force by hiring additional sales personnel and management  and increase the number of relationships we have with companies that provide us with customer referrals or leads for new business 
historically  it has taken us up to six months to train new sales personnel before they reach an acceptable level of productivity 
we have also experienced difficulty in finding new sales personnel with experience in computer and telephone integration technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to find an adequate number of new sales personnel meeting our specific needs 
if the personnel we hire are less qualified  it may take us more time to train them and they may take a longer time to reach an acceptable level of productivity 
we also intend to derive revenue from our indirect sales channel through relationships with companies that resell our software 
in particular  we intend to use resellers to increase our sales internationally and to market our software to small and medium contact centers 
when we enter into agreements with these companies  they are not exclusive and may ordinarily be terminated by either party 
some of these companies have similar  and often more established  relationships with our competitors  and may recommend the products and services of our competitors to customers instead of our software and services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain productive relationships or that we will be able to establish similar relationships with additional companies on a timely basis  or at all 
in addition  we cannot be certain that these distribution partners will devote adequate resources to selling our software and services 
if we are unable to maintain and expand our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  we will not be able to increase our revenue and our business will suffer 
if our internal professional services employees do not provide installation services effectively and according to schedule  our customers may not use our installation services or may stop using our software customers that license our products ordinarily purchase installation  training and maintenance services  which they typically obtain from our internal professional services organization 
because our software must be installed to work with a number of computer and telephone network systems  installation of our software can be difficult 
these systems vary greatly from one customer site to another  and the versions and integration requirements of these third party systems change frequently 
we believe that the speed and quality of installation services are competitive factors in our industry 
if our installation services are not satisfactory to our customers  the customers may choose to not use our installation services to install software they license from us 
in addition  these customers may determine that they will not license our software and instead will use the products and services of one of our competitors 
if this happens  we would lose licensing and services revenue from these customers  and it would likely harm our reputation in the industry in which we compete 
this could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may make acquisitions or investments that are not successful and that adversely affect our ongoing operations we may acquire or make investments in companies  products  services and technologies which we believe complement our software and services 
because of the increasing use of new customer interaction mediums such as the internet and e mail  we believe that it may be important for us to acquire complementary technology to quickly bring new products to market 
our overall gross profit margins may decrease as we integrate additional third party components into our new or existing products or make investments in third party technology 
we have very limited experience in making acquisitions and investments 
as a result  our ability to identify prospects  conduct acquisitions and properly manage the integration of acquisitions is unproven 
if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments  it may seriously harm our business and operating results 
in making or attempting to make acquisitions or investments  we face a number of risks  including identifying suitable acquisition or investment candidates  performing appropriate due diligence  identifying potential liabilities and negotiating acceptable terms for acquisitions and investments  the potential distraction of our management  diversion of our resources and disruption of our business  retaining and motivating key employees of the acquired companies  managing operations that are distant from our current headquarters and operations  entering into geographic markets in which we have little or no prior experience  competing for acquisition opportunities with competitors that are larger than we are or have greater financial and other resources than we have  accurately forecasting the financial impact of an acquisition or investment  maintaining good relations with the customers and suppliers of the acquired company  and effectively integrating acquired companies or investments into the company and achieving expected synergies 
on february   we announced a recommended offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of eyretel  a company headquartered in the united kingdom 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to complete the proposed transaction in a timely manner  if at all 
if we are able to complete the acquisition successfully  we will face many of the risks discussed above  including integrating the acquired business  managing expanded operations in new geographic markets and achieving the anticipated synergies of the combined companies 
in addition  since eyretel has historically placed greater emphasis on hardware products  we will face certain risks related to eyretel s operations 
in addition  if we make or finance acquisitions using convertible debt or equity securities  our existing stockholders may be diluted  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
if we make acquisitions out of our existing cash  our working capital may be significantly reduced  and our ability to expand  or to maintain our business in the face of a downturn in revenues or cash flow or unexpected increases in expenses  may be adversely affected  including our ability to make capital expenditures and fund operations 
in that event  we may need additional financing  which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
if we need additional financing to maintain or expand our business  it may not be available on favorable terms  or at all although we believe our current cash and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months and the foreseeable future  we may need additional funds to expand or meet all of our operating needs 
if we need additional financing  we cannot be certain that it will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  the ownership interest of our stockholders would be significantly diluted  and any additional equity securities we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our stockholders 
also  the terms of any additional financing we obtain may significantly limit our future financing and operating activities 
if we need funds and cannot raise them on acceptable terms  we may be forced to sell assets or seek to refinance our outstanding obligations 
we may also be unable to develop and enhance our software to remain competitive  take advantage of future opportunities  such as acquisitions  respond to changing customer needs and our competitors innovations  or attract and retain qualified key personnel 
any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial condition and limit our growth 
our stock price has been volatile the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results and other factors 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations from time to time that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
any announcement with respect to any adverse variance in revenue or earnings from levels generally expected by securities analysts or investors for a given period could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our competitors or third parties  changing conditions in the market for products that record and analyze customer interactions  changes in estimates by securities analysts  announcements of extraordinary events  such as acquisitions or litigation  or general economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
government regulation of telephone and internet monitoring could cause a decline in the use of our software  result in increased expenses for us or subject us and our customers to liability as the telecommunications industry continues to evolve  state  federal and foreign governments may increasingly regulate the monitoring of telecommunications and telephone and internet monitoring and recording products  such as our software 
we believe that increases in regulation could come in the form of a number of different kinds of laws  including privacy and employment regulations 
the adoption of new laws governing the use of our software or changes made to existing laws could cause a decline in the use of our software and could result in increased expenses for us  particularly if we are required to modify our software to accommodate these new or changing laws 
moreover  new laws or changes to existing laws could subject us and our customers to liability 
in addition  whether or not these laws are adopted  if we do not adequately address the privacy concerns of consumers  companies may be hesitant to use our software 
if any of these events occur  it could materially and adversely affect our business 
we may face difficulty in attracting and retaining key personnel  which are necessary to effectively manage and expand our business our future success will depend in large part on our ability to hire  train  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified personnel  particularly in sales  marketing  research and development  service and support 
in particular  competition for research and development personnel with computer and telephone integration skills is intense  and turnover of technical personnel is particularly high in our industry 
we expect to face additional difficulties retaining personnel who have stock options with exercise prices above the fair market value of our stock 
in order to retain some of our personnel  we will need to grant additional options to purchase common stock to these employees with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our stock  which will cause dilution to our stockholders 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel or if we experience high personnel turnover  it would increase our costs of operations and could prevent us from effectively managing and expanding our business 
our future success also depends upon the continued service of our executive officers  particularly our chairman and chief executive officer  david gould 
we have an employment agreement with mr 
gould and limited non compete agreements with all of our executive officers 
however  any of our executive officers and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
the loss of the services of our executive officers or other key personnel could materially and adversely affect our business 
in addition  if one or more of our executive officers or key employees were to join one of our competitors or otherwise compete with us  it could harm our business 
our management and affiliates control a large percentage of our voting stock and could exert significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval at december   our executive officers and directors and their affiliates together controlled approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  if they act together  will be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as delaware law  may prevent or delay a future takeover our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions which could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without consent of our board of directors 
for example  if a potential acquirer were to make a hostile bid for us  the acquirer would not be able to call a special meeting of stockholders to remove our board of directors or act by written consent without a meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has staggered terms which makes it difficult to remove all our directors at once 
the acquirer would also be required to provide advance notice of its proposal to remove directors at an annual meeting 
our board of directors has the ability to issue preferred stock which would significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer 
in addition  delaware law limits business combination transactions with stockholders that have not been approved by the board of directors 
in october  our board of directors approved  and we have implemented  a stockholder rights plan which has the effect of causing substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by the board of directors
