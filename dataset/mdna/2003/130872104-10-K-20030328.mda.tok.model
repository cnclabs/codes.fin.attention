part item business overview we are a leader in microfluidic lab on a chip technologies 
we believe our labchip systems can assemble the power and reduce the size of laboratories full of equipment and people 
our labchip systems miniaturize  integrate and automate many laboratory processes and put them on a chip 
each chip contains a network of microscopic channels through which fluids and chemicals are moved  using electricity or pressure  in order to perform experiments 
the chips are the key components of our labchip systems  which also include reagents  as well as instruments and software  that together control and read the chips 
we believe our labchip systems have the potential to revolutionize experimentation in a wide range of industries by enabling researchers to get better quality data faster while using less material 
our initial commercialization focus is the pharmaceutical industry  where there is an urgent need to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of drug discovery and development 
future target industries potentially include diagnostics  chemicals  agriculture and consumer products 
we believe that we are the first company to sell and deliver microfluidic lab on a chip products to customers 
we have two channels of distribution for our products  direct to customers and through original equipment manufacturers oem 
our oem distribution channel  of which agilent technologies  inc agilent is a prime example  is core to our business strategy  and complementary to our direct sales activities  as it enables us to extend the commercial potential of our microfluidic labchip technology into new industries and new applications with experienced commercial partners 
in the direct systems business  we sell complete systems solutions  developed by caliper  to end customers 
in the oem channel we provide chips and enabling technologies to commercial partners who then integrate the application solution and market it to their end customers 
our earliest revenues were derived primarily from contract revenue earned under our collaboration agreement with agilent and with other corporate partners through a fee based technology access program 
an initial microfluidic labchip system  the bioanalyzer  was introduced in late by our commercial partner  agilent 
subsequent to that  we began work on our own instrument systems while continuing to expand the menu of applications for the bioanalyzer 
in september  we began the transition to a commercial products business model when we launched the caliper drug discovery system 
currently we 
table of contents have three systems that we sell directly the caliper  the ams se  an automated electrophoresis system  and the caliper  a microfluidics applications development workstation 
in addition  our first and largest commercial partner  agilent  sells the bioanalyzer together with a comprehensive menu of applications for this instrument

our microfluidic labchip systems we developed our microfluidic labchip technology to provide a revolutionary advance in laboratory experimentation for the pharmaceutical and other industries 
the chips are the key components of our labchip systems  which also include a specific labchip instrument together with experiment specific reagents and software 
our chips contain a network of microscopic channels through which fluids and chemicals are moved to perform experiments 
a single type of chip used with customized reagents and software to perform a particular experiment make up one labchip application 
depending on the chip format  reagents are introduced either automatically or by the user 
the chip is then placed in the instrument  which uses software to control the movement of fluids with pressure or voltage 
the instrument also has an optical system for detecting the results 
because we have great flexibility in channel design and can exert split second computer control over fluid flow  we have the ability to create chips for a multitude of experiments 
our labchip systems miniaturize  integrate and automate experiments with the goal of providing the benefits of improved data accuracy  reduced cost  high speed  expanded individual researcher capability and improved enterprise wide productivity 
features of labchip systems miniaturization 
conventional laboratory equipment typically uses about a drop of fluid  to microliters  to perform each experiment 
in some labchip applications  this volume is reduced to nanoliter  or one billionth of a liter  an improvement of up to  fold over conventional systems 
integration 
integration is the compression of multiple processes into a single process  or the inclusion of multiple functions into one device 
today most laboratory systems perform only one or two steps of an experimental protocol 
our labchip systems can integrate complete experiments involving half a dozen or more steps into one continuous process performed on a single chip 
automation 
many laboratory experiments are performed in multiple manual steps 
with our labchip systems  entire experiments can be automated and performed inside a chip using one instrument  freeing up valuable research time 

table of contents key benefits of labchip systems improved data accuracy 
our labchip systems are designed to produce more accurate and consistent data by reducing human error and the variability caused by the use of multiple instruments 
with higher quality data  our customers can make better decisions 
for example  biochemical determinations typically require accurate liquid measurements and precise incubation times 
when these are manually performed significant variations can occur in liquid dispensing and in the duration of reaction times 
reduced reagent and labor cost 
our labchip systems utilize only a small fraction of the usual amount of expensive reagents used in experiments performed in test tubes  well plates  or well plates  and also reduce labor involved in each experiment 
we believe that saving on reagent cost and labor can enable pharmaceutical companies to expand the scale of experimentation in ways that would otherwise not be feasible 
high speed 
we believe our labchip systems can accelerate some experiments as much as fold or more  depending on the application 
for example  molecular separations such as electrophoresis may take two hours or more using conventional equipment 
on a chip  we can perform these separations in less than one minute 
another example is that chemical reactions are routinely incubated for minutes or more before the results are determined 
often  these long incubation periods are necessary only to provide sufficient time for manual steps to be performed on large numbers of samples 
by integrating sample processing and detection  we can perform reactions in one minute or less and achieve comparable results 
our customers may be able to take advantage of this acceleration to increase throughput or to complete experiments faster  depending on their needs 
expanded individual researcher capability 
because our labchip systems can collapse a multi step  complex experiment into one step  we believe that individual researchers can perform experiments previously outside their areas of expertise 
by comparison  with conventional  non integrated equipment  researchers need to acquire the equipment and master the complexities of performing each individual step 
improved enterprise wide productivity 
we believe our labchip systems can improve data quality to the point where researchers can rely on data generated outside their laboratory or organization 
we believe this would improve enterprise wide productivity by supporting data sharing and reducing the need to repeat experiments 
when different research groups use different assortments of conventional equipment to perform experiments  they often produce data that are not strictly comparable 
we believe that our microfluidic labchip systems have the potential to expand the capabilities and improve the productivity of individual researchers and  on an institutional level  to streamline and bring greater efficiency and speed to the drug discovery and development process 
not all laboratory processes  however  are ideally suited to be performed with our labchip systems 
for example  detecting clinically important materials that appear in low concentrations in a sample  such as the virus that causes aids  is not always practical with our microfluidic labchip systems 
this is because there is a risk that the virus will not be present in the very small volumes employed by our chips 
as a result  in certain applications use of our microfluidic labchip system may require the pre processing of a sample to increase concentration 
furthermore  if the analysis of a sample must involve even one process that cannot currently be performed in the microfluidic labchip system  then use of the microfluidic labchip system for the parts it can perform is often impractical 
this is because the very small scale of the chip experiment does not generally produce enough material to be analyzed by conventional laboratory equipment 
products and services we have developed three types of labchip systems  based on distinct chip formats personal laboratory systems  automated systems and application development systems 
our personal laboratory system uses chips with reservoirs for the various chemical reagents 
with this system  the user introduces reagents and samples manually 
our automated systems use our sipper chips that have a short tube  or capillary  that draws nanoliter 
table of contents volumes of reagents or samples into the chip 
our application development system  which is principally intended for use by oem partners  is a flexible workstation that is used during product and application development 
personal laboratory systems agilent bioanalyzer 
the first instrument platform to be introduced for labchip applications is the agilent bioanalyzer  a desktop instrument designed to perform a wide range of everyday scientific applications using a menu of different labchip kits 
each kit contains a chip and reagents designed specifically for the application 
this labchip system brings the benefits of miniaturized  integrated and automated experimentation to the researcher s desktop 
agilent launched this product in september and continues to sell it today together with an expanded menu of applications 
product description status agilent bioanalyzer desktop labchip instrument and software marketed by agilent dna labchip kit chips and reagents for analyzing large dna fragments marketed by agilent dna labchip kit chips and reagents for analyzing medium dna fragments marketed by agilent dna labchip kit chips and reagents for analyzing small dna fragments marketed by agilent dna labchip kit chips and reagents for analyzing very small dna fragments marketed by agilent protein plus labchip kit chips and reagents for analyzing protein samples marketed by agilent protein labchip kit chips and reagents for analyzing small protein samples marketed by agilent rna nano labchip kit chips and reagents for analyzing rna samples marketed by agilent rna pico labchip kit chips and reagents for analyzing very small amounts ofrna marketed by agilent cell fluorescence labchip kit chips and reagents for analyzing cells marketed by agilent agilent is selling the agilent bioanalyzer with a menu of four labchip kits for dna sizing and concentration analysis  two for rna sizing and concentration analysis  two for protein sample sizing and concentration analysis and one for cell analysis 
for these applications  we believe the system s principal advantages are that it reduces analysis time from hours to minutes through the automation and integration of multiple experimental steps  integrates several experimentation steps into one  significantly reduces consumption of costly reagents and difficult to obtain samples  and produces higher quality data than conventional methods 
because these applications are among the most common experiments performed in genetic research  the potential customer base for these applications includes most pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as research centers and other academic laboratories 

table of contents automated systems our automated systems are designed to perform hundreds to tens of thousands of pharmaceutical experiments per day on each chip 
the instrument platforms on which these systems run today include the caliper ams se and the caliper we are also developing new instrument platforms that have the potential to offer customers greater functionality and flexibility for automated experimentation 
we believe the principal advantages of caliper s automated systems are that they produce more reproducible  higher data quality than conventional methods  integrate multiple experimental functions  reduce the need for user intervention  and reduce costly reagent consumption 
caliper system 
the caliper system performs screening experiments in a serial  continuous flow fashion inside the microchannels of the chip  constituting a closed  controlled environment 
the chip employs a proprietary capillary like sample access system  called a sipper  through which nanoliters of test compounds are drawn into the channels of the chip from microwell plates 
there they are mixed with equally tiny quantities of the target biomolecule and other reagents for screening 
the caliper system using a sipper chip is capable of performing tens of thousands of experiments per chip per day  depending upon assay conditions  and offers walk away automation and minimal user intervention 
the system currently performs fluorogenic and electrophoretic mobility assays for multiple target classes including kinases  proteases  lipid modulating enzymes and phosphatases 
we also offer  on an early release basis  a chip that performs a calcium flux assay  essentially enabling researchers to monitor intracellular levels of calcium  an important variable in the analysis of g protein coupled receptors gpcrs 
early release products are available and sold to customers on a limited basis as they have not fully completed our product development process 
additional assays are in development 
we market and distribute the caliper system directly through our own sales and marketing group 
in addition to paying for the caliper instrument and compatible sipper chips  users of the system also typically pay to us  on a quarterly basis  datapoint fees based on the number of samples that the customer has processed through the caliper system 
prior to the caliper system  the following instruments were available the caliper system  the caliper system  and the caliper system 
however  with the introduction of the caliper system  we have discontinued offering the other systems

the automated microfluidics system se  or ams se  is an automated electrophoresis system designed to meet the needs of microarray and cloning laboratories that analyze hundreds of dna samples per day 
the ams se  introduced in january  is an improved version of the caliper ams the ams was originally introduced in the third quarter of  with the first units shipped to customers in the first quarter of the ams se uses sipper chip technology to 
table of contents perform dna fragment sizing  separation and quantitation analyses 
the ams se s new features include compatibility with and well plates  two dna analysis speeds seconds sample and seconds sample  and a bar code reader for plate tracking 
a protein assay for the ams se is in development 
we are commercializing the ams se through our own sales and marketing force 
application development systems caliper system 
the caliper system enables users to develop proficiency in fundamental microfluidics and to develop novel chip based microfluidic applications using our proprietary labchip technology 
principally for use by oem partners  the caliper system includes an applications development workstation and diverse chip menu 
product description status caliper system workstation for investigating and developing new microfluidic applications available from caliper microfluidic developer labchip kits six different chips and manuals for performing a variety of experiments available from caliper services during  caliper transitioned from a fee based technology access program model to a commercial products business 
previously caliper used its automated systems internally to offer screening services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers that preferred to outsource this activity 
as a result of our transition away from a fee based technology access program model to a commercial product business  we no longer offer these services 
however  we do offer a full range of customer and field service support for the products that we sell directly to customers

commercialization our business model includes two distribution channels one where we sell directly to customers direct and another that relies on commercial partners to sell to end users oem 
for example  in the us and europe we sell our automated systems  including the caliper system for drug discovery screening and the ams se for automated electrophoresis  directly to end user customers 
in japan  we have an exclusive distributor  wako pure chemical industries  ltd 
wako 
wako is a major supplier of specialty chemicals  clinical diagnostics and biological products for japanese biotech research 
to complement our direct efforts  caliper is developing an oem distribution channel 
in this case  we sell microfluidic labchip systems and products to end users through partners 
for example  the agilent bioanalyzer and related labchip kits are sold by our largest commercial partner  agilent 
in addition  we have a multiple smaller partnerships in earlier stages of development 
collaboration with agilent in may we established a broad relationship with agilent to create a line of commercial research products based on our microfluidic labchip technologies 
this relationship provides us with the scale and 
table of contents expertise of a leading analytical instrumentation company to bring these novel products to market 
since this relationship was established in may  agilent and caliper have collectively invested over million to advance our core labchip technologies and to create and commercialize a line of products based on these technologies 
in september  agilent introduced the agilent bioanalyzer with three different labchip kits  our first labchip products under this agreement 
subsequently  agilent and caliper have expanded the agilent bioanalyzer application menu with six additional labchip kits 
our collaboration relationship with agilent was established on a mutually exclusive basis during the term of the collaboration 
the field of the collaboration includes products based on our lab on a chip technologies for research  development  analytical and manufacturing applications  but excludes almost all diagnostic applications 
under the terms of our agreement  agilent is required to obtain our consent before it may offer products exceeding established sample throughput limits  other than through our product collaboration 
in return  caliper is required to obtain agilent s consent before we may develop or offer caliper products within the collaboration field of interest  directly or with other oem customers  in excess of agreed upon limits 
in december  we agreed to permit agilent to develop and manufacture certain chromatography products independent of caliper  subject to gross margin sharing payments to caliper  and agilent agreed that caliper could offer drug discovery products in the research market outside of our collaboration 
in may  we notified agilent of our intent to terminate the collaboration agreement effective may  as permitted under the terms of the agreement 
the existing collaboration agreement with agilent spells out in detail the nature of the companies commercial product supply relationships for a three year period after termination 
our principal motivation in terminating the formal agreement with agilent was to give us more flexibility in developing new applications with other commercial partners 
termination of the agreement will also provide caliper with greater ability to market and sell existing products in the field of the collaboration directly to end user customers  in part utilizing the reciprocal supply arrangements set forth in the termination provisions of the agreement 
both parties will either operate under the existing termination provisions of the collaboration agreement or establish new terms  as yet to be determined 
in our collaboration with agilent  caliper has primarily focused on developing core labchip technology and product applications 
we have also manufactured the chips and supplied the chips and reagents to agilent 
agilent has primarily focused on developing instruments and software  manufacturing instruments and marketing  selling and supporting complete systems 
agilent and caliper have worked in a collaborative manner to identify new applications for development and distribution 
historically agilent has also provided product development funding to caliper 
this funding could cease at any time after the termination of the formal agreement in may however  we anticipate that some product development funding will continue as we are working steadily with agilent to develop new products 
under the collaboration  agilent purchases chips and reagents at a price which reimburses us for our costs of manufacturing chips and reagents and pays us a share of the gross margin on sales by agilent of all components of labchip systems  including instruments 
we recognize revenue related to the reimbursement of costs for the supply of chips and reagents to agilent upon shipment and we recognize the related costs as components of cost of sales 
we recognize as revenue our share of gross margin on components of the systems sold by agilent upon shipment to the end user 
this general structure for existing products will survive termination of the agreement 
our gross margin share varies depending on the type of collaboration product  and on whether agilent or we manufacture the collaboration product 
after the collaboration agreement terminates in may  our gross margin share for existing products will remain the same until november in november  our gross margin share for chips and reagents will decrease  and in may our gross margin share for chips and reagents will decrease again 
our gross margin share for existing instruments will also decrease in the same time periods  although at somewhat different rates 
upon termination of the agreement in may  agilent will have a non exclusive license in the field of the collaboration to caliper s then existing labchip technology to develop  manufacture and sell new products in that field 
agilent will be required to pay royalties to caliper based on its net revenue from sales of such products at the established royalty rates set forth in the termination provisions of our collaboration agreement 

table of contents upon termination of the agreement  to the extent requested by agilent  caliper will be obligated to continue to supply existing chips and reagents to agilent for a three year period 
agilent will also have a non exclusive license to manufacture chips for agilent labchip applications  in each case subject to gross margin sharing or royalty payments to caliper described above 
during the six month period following termination  caliper will also be obligated to train agilent personnel with respect to the manufacturing of chips  subject in certain circumstances to reimbursement by agilent of our incurred expenses 
agilent will be similarly obligated to train caliper personnel regarding the manufacturing of instruments  and upon caliper s request  to transfer to us all agilent know how incorporated into collaboration products 
caliper will retain its entire license rights to agilent s technology granted to us during the term of the collaboration 
after a six month period following termination of our agreement with agilent  caliper will be entitled to market  sell and support  either independently or with other third parties  all products developed during the collaboration 
for a three year period following termination  caliper will be required to purchase its requirements for such products from agilent  on the terms set forth in the termination provisions of the agreement 
in summary  although our first collaborative agreement with agilent will end effective may  we highly value our relationship with agilent 
we will work to continue to grow our business with agilent  either in accordance with the termination provisions set forth in the existing agreement or pursuant to new terms to be agreed to by agilent and us 
additional corporate partnerships central to caliper s business strategy is the expansion of the number and type of our commercial relationships 
in addition to agilent  the most mature of these partnerships  caliper has announced agreements with two companies 
these companies are bacterial barcodes  inc and ambion  inc 
in addition  caliper has certain research collaborations that we believe have the potential to evolve into commercial partnerships 
bacterial barcodes  inc in december  we entered into an agreement with bacterial barcodes  inc bbci to co distribute molecular diagnostic systems based on our microfluidic labchip technology and bbci s proprietary molecular identification and dna fingerprinting technology known as rep pcr repetitive sequence based polymerase chain reaction 
as part of this collaboration  we developed the caliper analyzer system in the caliper analyzer instrument is manufactured for us by agilent on an oem basis 
the caliper analyzer is being used with bbci s proprietary rep pcr products to generate dna fingerprints of bacteria for microbial typing and identification applications 
we believe that the combination of caliper s microfluidic labchip systems for dna analysis and bbci s rep pcr technology offers a practical method to quickly produce bacterial fingerprints in an automated format 
the rep pcr method produces a mixture of dna fragments of varying sizes that must be separated according to size to form the actual unique fingerprint patterns 
previously  the rep pcr method relied upon dna molecule separation using traditional slab gel electrophoresis  a largely manual and time consuming process 
the combined caliper bbci system is in the final stages of field testing 
relative to traditional approaches  the system offers improved speed  ease of use and data analysis capabilities 
customer response at the testing sites has been positive  and we anticipate a product rollout in bbci initially has targeted laboratories involved in epidemiology testing  such as reference laboratories and facilities in large hospitals 
a clinical product  requiring regulatory approval  is also planned for which bbci will manage the required submissions to the food and drug administration 
under our agreement  caliper will provide chips and analysis reagents to bbci 
bbci will sell a combined assay kit that includes our chips and their rep pcr dna fingerprinting reagents and protocols  plus software to access bbci s database of bacterial dna fingerprints 
we will market and sell the caliper analyzer designed to run the chips 
ambion  inc in october  we initiated an application development collaboration with ambion  inc ambion  an rna based products company  to develop a microfluidic rna amplification system 
the system would be used by researchers conducting gene expression experiments to prepare an amplified rna probe prior to performing microarray analysis 
currently available amplification processes are labor intensive 

table of contents additionally  the quantity of sample rna to be amplified is often limited 
these challenges  which contribute to the time and expense of conventional rna amplification methods  can also impact the validity of the results 
caliper and ambion hope to address these inefficiencies by optimizing and automating rna amplification in a microfluidic environment 
the benefits of this approach should include increasing throughput  greater ease of use  minimizing sample requirements and achieving a uniformly high level of consistency in the amplified rna probe 
currently  caliper scientists are developing the microfluidic labchip device and instrument platform  assisting with assay development and collaborating with ambion in the development of the integrated system 
it is conceivable that a third party will also participate in the development of the instrumentation 
at this time  ambion is primarily involved in the assay development and is optimizing reagents and conditions for the chip 
we are working to develop a first generation labchip device and to complete feasibility experiments 
in  we anticipate making further progress toward an early stage  completely integrated labchip amplification system 
to date this work has been largely funded through ambion by a small business innovation research grant from the national institute of general medical sciences 
other corporate relationships in  caliper created the applications developer program adp to enable customers to establish their own in house microfluidic research programs using our microfluidic labchip technology and developmental tool set 
participation in the adp involved the purchase of instrumentation  training in microfluidics  custom chip design services and a supply of microfluidic chips 
during participation in the adp  customers would determine the feasibility of  and develop  novel microfluidic applications by identifying an assay to address their specific needs 
subsequently  we would custom design a chip to perform that assay 
we retain the rights to microfluidic technologies resulting from these collaborations  subject in some circumstances to royalties or other compensation to our collaborators 
all of the five adp collaborations underway at the beginning of are being assessed to determine if they have significant commercial potential and a specific path to commercialization  similar to the criteria that we apply to our oem prospects 
using this criteria  one of the collaborations  with an unnamed agricultural partner  has recently been terminated 
relationship with amphora discovery corp 
in september  caliper completed the formation of a new company  amphora discovery corp 
amphora  to create and commercialize a comprehensive database of chemical genomics information 
since that time  amphora has engaged in large scale implementation of labchip drug discovery systems purchased directly from caliper 
headquartered in research triangle park  north carolina  amphora also maintains an office in mountain view  california 
at the time of its formation  various venture capital firms invested million in amphora  resulting in amphora becoming a separate  independent company from caliper with its own management team and board of directors 
arch venture partners and venrock associates are two of the venture capital firms that have invested in amphora 
one of our directors  robert t 
nelsen  is a managing director of arch venture partners  and another of our directors  anthony b 
evnin  is a managing general partner of venrock associates 
in december  amphora completed a second round of venture capital financing 
after the completion of this financing  caliper s ownership in amphora was reduced to approximately from on a fully diluted basis 
over time  if amphora raises further equity capital  we expect that our ownership in amphora will be further diluted  as we have no plans to make any future equity investments in amphora 
caliper initially had the right to appoint two representatives to amphora s six member board of directors 
on march   one of caliper s two representatives  dr 
michael r 
knapp  resigned from amphora s board of directors 
due to the reduction in caliper s percentage ownership of amphora  caliper now has the right to appoint only one member to amphora s board 
dr 
daniel l 
kisner  our chairman of the board  continues to serve as the sole caliper representative on amphora s board of directors 

table of contents since the completion of amphora s initial financing in september  our investment in amphora has been accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
as our investment in amphora has no basis for accounting purposes and  because caliper does not guarantee any debt or have any commitment to fund losses of amphora  caliper has not recorded its proportionate share of amphora s operating losses in its financial statements 
the completion of amphora s second round of venture capital financing in december did not have any impact on our method of accounting for amphora 
for the fiscal year ended  sales to amphora of instruments  labchip devices  datapoints and contract services were million 
of the million in total sales  million related to drug discovery system products and  under the equity method of accounting  caliper deferred of the gross profit of these sales  or  that reflects its retained ownership interest in the products sold to amphora in as all drug discovery system sales to amphora occurred prior to amphora s december third party financing  all future drug discovery system sales will be deferred at caliper s then retained ownership interest level which is approximately currently 
in  caliper recognized a total of  of this deferred gross profit as revenue of which  related to drug discovery system products sold in and  related to products sold in caliper expects to recognize the remaining  as revenue ratably over the next months as amphora records depreciation on its caliper drug discovery systems 
for the fiscal year ended  sales to amphora of instruments  labchip devices  datapoints and contract services were million 
as further described below  caliper and amphora agreed to a restructuring of the commercial relationship between the two companies in december based on the restructured relationship  we expect in that amphora will purchase one caliper instrument and make approximately million in minimum datapoint payments to us 
all revenues generated from amphora are reported as related party revenues 
in september  we entered into a labchip solutions agreement and an intellectual property agreement with amphora 
under the intellectual property agreement  we granted amphora certain exclusive rights to use our drug discovery products in a chemical genomics database business 
the labchip solutions agreement provided for the ongoing supply of our drug discovery systems and chips to amphora  and for the provision of related services by us to amphora 
under this agreement  amphora had agreed to purchase a minimum of caliper instruments by december  and at least additional caliper instruments by december  amphora had also agreed to purchase datapoints at a fixed amount of million in the first year and a minimum of million to a maximum  based on volume  of million in the second year of the agreement  which began in december in connection with the completion of amphora s december financing  caliper and amphora agreed to a renegotiation of amphora s obligations under the labchip solutions agreement 
under the renegotiated agreement  the companies agreed to restructure the million minimum datapoint payment for as follows amphora agreed to purchase a minimum of million of datapoints during the second year of the agreement beginning in december and over time to make up to million of deferred payments to caliper 
these deferred payments are contingent upon amphora s future revenue generation  datapoint production and other conditions and can be satisfied by amphora under three methods i quarterly payments to caliper based on amphora s revenues  ii commissions earned by amphora as they provide certain marketing assistance to caliper for caliper s instruments  and iii additional datapoint payments if amphora exceeds the certain minimum datapoint levels 
caliper also agreed to defer to december  amphora s obligation to purchase the one remaining caliper instrument of the originally scheduled to be purchased by amphora before december  in consideration for caliper s agreement to this restructuring  amphora issued to caliper million shares of amphora preferred stock 
caliper ascribed a nominal value of  to these shares as amphora is a privately held research and development company 
in september  amphora entered into a three year sublease agreement with caliper for the rent of approximately  square feet in one of caliper s three mountain view  ca leased buildings for amphora s research and development use 
in december  in connection with the completion of amphora s financing  we agreed to an early termination of this sublease agreement as of march  although we were receiving approximately  a month in rent from amphora  we intend to utilize this  square feet for our own research and development activities starting in april 
table of contents early commercial model technology access program prior to transitioning to a commercial products business model  we had technology access program tap customers 
in this program  focused on drug discovery screening systems  we worked directly with pharmaceutical company customers during the product development process 
in  following the commercial launch of the caliper system  our existing tap customers purchased these systems for their internal use 
these customers included millennium pharmaceuticals  eli lilly and amgen 
beginning in august  within the context of our planned evolution away from the technology access program and conversion to a commercial products business structure  we initiated the renegotiation of our tap agreements 
we proposed to each customer  and they agreed  to convert the remaining technology access and subscription fees due us under their agreement to credits toward the purchase of products and services 
the renegotiated contracts with amgen  eli lilly and millennium include discounts off our product list prices for their commitment and ongoing participation as a customer of our commercial business for a time period roughly equivalent to the length of time that they were a tap customer 
customers to date  we have generated a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of sources 
in the year ended december   agilent  our major collaboration partner  alone accounted for of our total revenue and of our product revenue 
we notified agilent in may of our election to terminate the agreement between the companies as of may under the terms of our agreement with agilent  when our agreement terminates in may  we will grant to agilent a non exclusive  royalty bearing license to our lapchip technologies as then developed for agilent to develop  make and sell products in the field of the collaboration 
consequently  there is the possibility that we may experience competition from agilent after may  which would reduce our ability to sell products independently or through other commercial partners 
amphora  a related party  accounted for of our total revenue and of our product revenue 
initial licensing of the ramsey family of patents to aclara accounted for of our revenue and our former technology access program customers  amgen  eli lilly and millennium  collectively accounted for of our revenue in the period

technology we believe that we have established a leading position in three areas of lab on a chip technology 
microfabrication we create microfluidic lab on a chip devices using manufacturing methods similar to the semiconductor industry  sometimes referred to as microfabrication 
microfabrication makes it possible to create intricate 
table of contents designs of interconnected channels that are extremely small and precise 
each pattern is designed to support a series of fluid manipulation steps that will comprise an experiment 
we use the principles of fluid dynamics  chemical and electrical engineering  biophysics and computer aided design tools to create various chip designs 
because we have designed  manufactured and tested hundreds of different chip configurations  we have the know how and have developed proprietary design tools that make each cycle of chip creation and application development faster 
the chips are designed to be passive devices  inexpensive and easy to manufacture 
they rely on computer controlled specialized instrumentation to manipulate the timing and sequencing of chemical processes on the chip 
once a design or pattern is completed  we use microfabrication methods to replicate the design as channels in a sheet of quartz or glass 
this process creates highly precise and reproducible channels with dimensions that can be varied by width and depth 
a typical channel is roughly microns wide and microns deep  or smaller than the size of a strand of human hair 
in the next step  a second sheet of quartz or glass with a pattern of holes  or wells  is fused to the first sheet using a proprietary bonding process 
this second sheet covers the channels and converts them into closed microfluidic conduits 
the end of each channel connects to an open reservoir through which fluids are introduced 
the sheets are then cut into individual chips  which can be less than one inch to a few inches on a side 
the individual chips are then packaged into plastic holders making them easier to handle 
we currently make two chip formats 
in our planar chips  such as those used in the agilent bioanalyzer  the user pipettes all of the chemical reagents into the reservoirs or wells of the chip  including the various samples to be tested 
the chip is then placed into the instrument 
in our sipper chip products  such as those used in the ams se and the caliper system  a small glass tube  or capillary  is part of the chip 
once the user prepares the chip and the chip is placed into a caliper instrument  minute quantities of sample can be introduced  or sipped  through the capillary into the chip 
this sipping process can be repeated many times  enabling a single chip to analyze thousands of samples quickly and without human intervention 
samples on sipper chips are processed utilizing continuous flow designs with integrated channel networks for completing experiments 
we have a number of issued us patents covering this sipper and continuous flow assay technique 
microfluidics in our labchip systems  the movement of minute quantities of fluids  or microfluidics  is actively controlled by computer programs 
we use two different methods of generating fluid motion in microchannels  namely  electrokinetics and pressure 
electrokinetic flow is generated when electrodes connected to computer driven power supplies are placed in the reservoirs at each end of a channel and activated to generate electrical current through the channel 
under these conditions  fluids of the appropriate type will move by a process known as electro osmosis 
another electrokinetic phenomenon known as electrophoresis also occurs in the channels 
this is the movement of charged molecules or particles in an electric field 
electrophoresis can be used to move molecules in solution or to separate molecules with very subtle differences 
electrophoresis and electro osmosis generally occur at the same time in channels 
however  we have developed proprietary techniques for minimizing either force while maintaining the other  as appropriate  for a given application 
pressure can also be used to move fluid in microchannels 
an advantage to using pressure is that both charged and uncharged molecules  as well as cells  can be moved without separation 
under typical conditions  flow rates in the microfluidic channels are about a millimeter per second 
at these rates  and in contrast to macro conditions  the dispersion of fluids is limited and highly predictable 
as a result  we are able to get very exact  reproducible data 
we use both computer controlled pressure and electrokinetic forces to gain precise control over fluid flow in the microfluidic channel network 
it is possible to use electrokinetic forces alone  pressure forces alone  or a combination of the two methods 

table of contents applications development we have developed a large amount of expertise at discovering new functions that microfluidic chips can perform 
we have generated proprietary computer models of how an experiment can be carried out 
we store these functional designs  and we can incorporate them into new designs that simulate complete experimental pathways 
in this way  we believe the value of new microfluidic inventions can be rapidly expanded across many application development projects 
we have also developed expertise conducting a variety of laboratory experiments in our chips 
currently  all of our systems use fluorescent chemical reagents and optical detection instruments to read experimental results 
we often need to explore chemical strategies for labeling relevant reagents that can reveal how different molecular interactions take place 
another area of investigation addresses the fact that in small dimensions  within which our products operate  the amount of channel surface material relative to the amount of liquid is many times higher than in a test tube or microwell plate 
because of this  the surface material can exert a much greater chemical influence on the biochemical reactions taking place 
we have created strategies to avoid the problems this can cause  or benefit from it if possible 
we have also developed sipper chips  which enable automated sample input into the chip  allowing for high throughput experimentation 
these sipper chips perform enzyme reactions using part of the channel design as a tiny  continuously operating electrophoresis machine 
thus  reactions with one sample are going on in one area of the chip while electrophoretic separation of the products of another sample is taking place in a different part of the chip 
such an assembly line approach yields highly reproducible data unmatched by macroscopic formats 
in general  our experience is that microfabrication and microfluidics provide a rich tool set with which to create innovative new applications 
research and development we have made substantial investments in lab on a chip research and product development since our inception 
we explored fundamental issues of lab on a chip technology as early as possible in order to find solutions to important technical challenges and seek patent protection for our solutions 
today we are supplementing these core technology research efforts with applied product development efforts in several areas 
technology research our technology research activities fall into several classes 
chip design 
we are increasing our understanding of the design rules guiding the development of new chips 
using the principles of engineering  we create patterns of interconnected channels that permit execution of the various common steps of experimentation 
designs from one chip can be used for other chips needing similar fluidic functions for a different application 
mathematics and computer models also help minimize the number of iterations necessary to achieve new functional chip designs 
chip manufacturing 
we continue to seek ways to improve the yield and decrease the cost of manufacturing our chips 
we are exploring novel fabrication techniques and the use of new materials that offer functional advantages  such as manufacturing in quartz to take advantage of its superior optical features 
we have development programs in manufacturing technology for chips made of plastic 
plastic devices potentially offer cost advantages and can offer favorable surface chemical features for some applications 
a major area of development is micromachining technology for precisely attaching capillaries to our sipper chips to access reagents 
in automated experimentation  the number of capillaries and channels determines the level of throughput 
accordingly  we are developing high yield fabrication methods to enable us to cost effectively manufacture chips with many capillaries to perform high throughput experimentation 
engineering and software 
we use the skills of electrical engineers  optical engineers  mechanical engineers  product designers and software engineers to create new instrumentation to run our chips 
these instruments control fluid movement inside the chip  present the reagents to the chip from conventional fluid sources  and detect the results of biochemical or cell based experiments with optical methods 
software 
table of contents engineers write computer programs that control the sources of fluid motion  communicate between different instrument components and interpret signals from the detection system 
currently we develop these incidental software programs for our automated systems 
this software has no separate utility outside of its function of running the caliper instrument 
we collaborate with agilent to develop software for the agilent bioanalyzer 
systems integration 
when developing commercial labchip products  we ensure that we incorporate all the features necessary for performing a specific experiment and configure the assay so that it offers tangible benefits to users 
by carefully characterizing the problem  as well as the microfluidic solution  we are able to define precise product specifications 
for instance  in each application  we determine how to manipulate flow conditions and how to control surface interactions in order to create novel functions and or suppress undesirable effects 
the resulting complete solution includes the labchip device  the instrument interface  computer software and reagents needed for each total microfluidic application 
product development our product development efforts are currently focused principally on new applications and capabilities for our existing instruments and the development of new instrument platforms 
extensions of existing product lines 
for our automated instrument systems  we are expanding the menu of applications to include assays that measure many important activities of cells and proteins 
currently in development is a protein assay for the ams se 
in our drug discovery screening line  we are developing line extensions that are particularly well suited for the evaluation of kinases  one of the largest focus areas of drug discovery efforts today 
our recently introduced products include a new sipper labchip device and an on chip mobility shift assay available on an early release basis  both well suited to kinase testing 
caliper is also developing kinase profiling and selectivity screening kits 
these kits will allow us to offer plug and play products to customers in the drug discovery market 
for the agilent bioanalyzer  we intend to continue enhancing the existing menu of applications 
we are also working with agilent to develop new products 
librarycard system 
caliper s microfluidic technology has the potential to reduce reagent  compound and sample consumption to remarkably small volumes in a wide variety of biochemical tests 
to enable the full potential of small volume usage on the chip  we have developed a system to reduce the volume of samples being tested to nanoliter scale 
in the librarycard system  samples or reagents to be tested are spotted down on specially prepared glass plates   different samples or reagents can be accommodated 
the spots are dried and the cards are stored until use with the caliper microfluidic system 
each spot contains a few tenths of a nanogram of material  incredibly small amounts  but enough for testing in caliper chips 
because chemical reagents are typically stable in dry formats  this technology has the additional benefit of enabling drug discovery screening and related testing in non centralized locations 
we are hoping to commercialize the technology through partnerships with other companies 
genetic analysis on a labchip device 
until the second half of  we were developing a labchip device for single nucleotide polymorphism snp analysis that we intended to commercialize directly 
more recently  we have decided to commercialize this product through corporate partnerships 
pcr  or polymerase chain reaction  is a technique for rapidly producing many copies of a section of dna 
like all experimentation processes  this application is a combination of various fluid manipulations  biochemical reactions and detection 
we are developing an integrated pcr application that is designed to perform the steps of reagent assembly  amplification and readout in rapid  serial fashion inside the channels of a microfluidic chip 
we believe that our genetic analysis system will offer the advantages of nanoliter scale processing of valuable reagents  automated reagent assembly and computer controlled heating and mixing for high quality data production 
though our nanoliter scale genetic analysis system is still in development  we are capable of routinely doing hour unattended runs involving thousands of nanoliter reactions with starting material down to single copies of genomic dna 
compared to conventional methods  which take about minutes  we can do a complete reaction in about minutes 
this underscores the benefits that can be achieved by integrating and automating multiple complex experimental steps on a single chip 

table of contents our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we expect research and development spending to decrease in the future as we slow the pace of discretionary spending on research programs  complete certain research initiatives and continue to focus and prioritize ongoing research programs 
as of december   we had employees engaged in research and development  including with advanced degrees 
manufacturing we manufacture all of our chips  automated instrument systems and a variety of consumables in house 
caliper is iso compliant for the development  manufacture and distribution of its chips and reagent systems 
iso  the international standards organization  sets international standards for quality in product design  manufacturing and distribution 
we rely upon agilent to manufacture the agilent bioanalyzer and  on an oem basis  the caliper analyzer 
we contract with third parties to supply raw materials  component parts and sub assemblies used in our chips  reagents and instrument systems 
we intend to continue to invest in our infrastructure for the manufacture and distribution of our chips and to continue to work with third parties for outsourcing opportunities for non chip based products 
for a discussion of the methods we use to manufacture our chips see technology and research and development 
suppliers key components of our chips  instruments and reagent based products are obtained from a number of single source or limited source suppliers 
we rely on a privately held company for the supply of proprietary dyes used in many of our labchip products 
furthermore  we depend on a foreign single source supplier for the manufacture of glass stock used in the manufacture of certain types of our chips 
the majority of our key components for our chip and instrument products are readily available from our suppliers to meet production requirements 
the only component requiring any significant lead time to acquire is our proprietary glass stock  as our supplier requires a minimum order to cover an entire production run 
we anticipate that inventories of this proprietary material  at current production levels  will be sufficient for the next months 
although we have established licensing arrangements and supply agreements with these suppliers  as well as other single or limited source suppliers  there can be no assurances that these companies would not in some way be adversely affected in the future and be unable to meet our critical supply needs 
in the event that the supply of components from these suppliers and other single source or limited source suppliers were interrupted  we may not be able to manufacture  or manufacture in a timely fashion or in significant quantities  our products  which would delay our ability to deliver products to our customers 
commodity price risk some of the raw materials we use are subject to price volatility caused by supply conditions  economic variables and other unpredictable factors 
historically we have not experienced significant supply or price constraints and we do not expect our financial position  profitability and liquidity to be affected materially by the supply level fluctuations 
competition although we believe that we are currently one of only a few companies selling and delivering  directly or in collaboration with corporate partners  commercial microfluidic lab on a chip products to customers  we expect to encounter intense competition from a number of companies that offer products for laboratory experimentation 
we anticipate that our competitors will come primarily from the following three sectors companies providing conventional products for applications similar to ours  but based on established technologies  and incremental improvements to these products  companies developing their own microfluidics or lab on a chip technologies  and 
table of contents companies developing new non chip technologies that can be used in applications similar to the ones that can be served by our technology 
in order to compete against vendors of conventional products  we will need to demonstrate the advantages of our labchip products over alternative well established technologies and products 
we will also need to demonstrate the potential economic value of our labchip products relative to these conventional technologies and products 
some of the companies that provide these products include the applied biosystems division of applera  agilent  amersham biosciences  beckman coulter  bio rad laboratories  molecular devices  perkinelmer and tecan 
we will also need to compete effectively with companies developing their own microfluidics or lab on a chip technologies and products  such as fluidigm  gyros  handylab  micronics  microfluidic systems and nanostream 
other companies known to have initiated microfluidic programs include motorola  m  applied biosystems  amersham biosciences  cepheid and hitachi 
microfluidic technologies have undergone and are expected to continue to undergo rapid and significant change 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in these and future technologies  which we may not be able to do 
rapid technological development may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete 
products offered by us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or other technologies 
in addition  there is the possibility that we may experience competition from agilent after may under the terms of our agreement  upon termination we will grant to agilent a non exclusive  royalty bearing license to our labchip technologies as then currently developed 
under the terms of this license  agilent will be able to develop  make and sell products in the field of our collaboration with agilent 
in many instances  our competitors have or will have substantially greater financial  technical  research and other resources and larger  more established marketing  sales  distribution and service organizations than we do 
moreover  competitors may have greater name recognition than we do  and may offer discounts as a competitive tactic 
we cannot assure you that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products  or that would render our technologies and products obsolete 
also  we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with our technologies 
intellectual property we seek patent protection on our lab on a chip technologies 
as of march   we owned or held licenses to issued us patents and pending us patent applications  some of which derive from a common parent application 
the issued us patents expire between and foreign counterparts of many of these patents and applications have been filed and or issued in one or more other countries  resulting in a total of more than issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states and foreign countries 
these patents and applications are directed to various technological areas which we believe are valuable to our business  including control of movement of fluid and other material through interconnected microchannels  continuous flow high throughput screening assay methods and systems  analytical and control instrumentation  analytical system architecture  chip based assay chemistries and methods  chip compatible sample accession  software for control of microfluidic based systems and data analysis  and chip manufacturing processes 

table of contents we also rely upon copyright protection  trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes  to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets  to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products used with our lab on a chip technology 
we are party to various exclusive and non exclusive license agreements with third parties which give us rights to use certain technologies 
for example  we have licenses in the fields we are currently operating in from ut battelle  llc  relating to patents covering inventions by dr 
j 
michael ramsey  and from the trustees of the university of pennsylvania covering microfluidic applications and chip structures 
a failure to maintain some or all of the rights to these technologies could seriously harm our business 
environmental matters we continuously assess the compliance of our operations with applicable federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
our policy is to record liabilities for environmental matters when loss amounts are probable and reasonably determinable 
our manufacturing site utilizes chemicals and other potentially hazardous materials and generates both hazardous and non hazardous waste  the transportation  treatment  storage and disposal of which are regulated by various governmental agencies 
we have engaged environmental consultants on a regular basis to assist with our compliance efforts 
we believe we are currently in compliance with all applicable environmental permits and are aware of our responsibilities under applicable environmental laws 
any expenditures necessitated by changes in law and permitting requirements cannot be predicted at this time  although such costs are not expected to be material to our financial position or results of operations

the following discussion and analysis is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
overview caliper is a leader in microfluidic lab on a chip technologies that miniaturize  integrate and automate many laboratory processes 
the company develops  manufactures and sells our proprietary labchip systems to pharmaceutical and other companies 
we believe our labchip systems have the potential to assemble the power  and reduce the scale  of laboratories full of equipment and people 
we utilize two distribution channels for our products 
in some cases  we sell instruments and chips directly to end users 
in other instances we sell products to commercial partners  who in turn sell these products to end users 
highlights 
during the year  caliper had a number of achievements that we believe better position the company for the future 
these included together with our commercial partner  agilent technologies  inc agilent  we introduced a new rna pico labchip kit for the bioanalyzer  a microfluidic benchtop system 
the menu of applications for the system now numbers nine and includes labchip kits for rna  dna  proteins and cells 
again with agilent  we enhanced the cell fluorescence labchip kit  also for the bioanalyzer  by incorporating cell staining into the chip 
we established a research collaboration with ambion  inc  an established leader in rna based research products  to develop a microfluidic rna amplification system 
we launched the ams se  our automated instrument platform for dna separations  allowing scientists to analyze large volumes of dna fragments quickly and efficiently 
this system  which we sell directly to end users  is targeted to those laboratories that analyze or more dna samples per day 
we introduced on an early release basis  the calcium flux labchip device for use with the caliper drug discovery system 
in this application  scientists investigating new chemical compounds can measure changes in intracellular calcium levels 
intracellular calcium levels are often used in pharmaceutical research and development as a means of studying interactions between potential drugs and particular receptors on a cell s surface that can be targets for pharmaceutical intervention in disease processes 
we saw increased usage of the caliper by customers doing production screening of pharmaceutical compound libraries 
we believe this is an important indication that customers are integrating our system into their protocols 
we expanded our intellectual property portfolio 
caliper was granted us patents  bringing our us patent count to at december  we also filed new us patent applications  increasing the total number of us patents in prosecution to at year end 
we improved yields across all labchip types  while increasing the number and variety of chips manufactured 

table of contents in addition to these achievements  there were changes in a number of areas that either had a direct financial impact in or have the potential to do so in the future 
these included conversion of technology access partners 
from caliper s inception in july through september  our operating activities were primarily devoted to research  development and commercialization of technologies involving the manipulation of very small amounts of fluid  which are referred to as microfluidic technologies 
during this period our revenues were principally from contract services and  to a lesser extent  from product sales 
with the introduction of the caliper drug discovery system in september  we transitioned to a commercial products business from a technology access model 
within the context of our planned discontinuation of our technology access program tap  we initiated the renegotiation of our agreements with amgen  eli lilly and millennium pharmaceuticals 
under the amended agreements with our tap customers  caliper agreed to convert technology access and subscription fees still outstanding to credits available towards the purchase of products and services that could be utilized by the customer no later than march in  we recognized million in revenue from these converted agreements based on purchases by our former tap customers of instruments  chips  support services and custom solutions directly from caliper 
as of december   a total of  of revenue remains deferred related to just one former tap customer 
we expect to recognize this deferred revenue in the first quarter of as this customer purchases products or services 
this ongoing revenue from former tap customers reflects the continued transition from a technology collaboration based company to a more scalable products based company 
however  it is still too soon to know whether these former tap customers will continue to purchase our products and services at historic levels now that their converted tap fees have been fully utilized  or whether we will be able to replace this revenue with revenue from sales to new customers 
related party 
entities upon which we can exercise significant influence  but not control  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
whether or not we exercise significant influence with respect to a company depends on an evaluation of several factors including  among others  representation on the company s board of directors and ownership level  generally between to interest in the voting securities of the company  including rights associated with our holding in common shares of the company 
in may  we formed amphora discovery corp 
amphora later transferring certain intangibles to amphora in september of that year 
also in september  amphora completed a private placement of securities with third party investors that reduced our ownership to 
in december  amphora completed a second placement of securities with third party investors raising additional capital that further reduced our ownership to approximately 
our investment in amphora continues to be accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
we initially received the right to appoint two representatives to amphora s six member board of directors 
on march   one of caliper s two representatives  dr 
michael knapp  resigned from amphora s board of directors 
due to the subsequent reduction in our percentage ownership  our right to appoint representatives to amphora s board declined to one 
as caliper s investment in amphora has no basis for accounting purposes and  because caliper does not guarantee any debt or have commitments to fund losses  caliper has not recorded its proportionate share of amphora s operating losses in its financial statements since the completion of amphora s first financing 
future investments by amphora s third party investors would further reduce our ownership interest 
caliper does not intend to make future equity investments in amphora 
since its inception and through december   amphora has purchased caliper drug discovery systems and million in datapoints 
in alone  we sold to amphora products and services totaling million and recorded it as a related party revenues in the financial statements 
of the million in total sales  million related to drug discovery system products 
under the equity method of accounting  we deferred of the gross profit of these sales  or  that reflected our retained ownership interest in the products sold to amphora in all drug discovery system sales to amphora occurred prior to amphora s december third party financing 
future system sales will be deferred at our then retained ownership interest level  which is currently approximately 
in  we recognized a total of  of this deferred gross profit as revenue of which  related to drug discovery system products sold in 
table of contents and  related to products sold in we expect to recognize the remaining  as revenue ratably over the next months as amphora records depreciation on its caliper systems 
commercial collaboration with agilent technologies  inc in may  we established a broad relationship with agilent technologies  inc agilent to create a line of commercial research products based on our microfluidic labchip technologies 
in september  agilent introduced our first labchip system for use by individual researchers 
subsequently  agilent and caliper have expanded the application menu for this product and engaged in other new product development activities 
under the collaboration agreement  agilent funds our research and development expenditures related to the collaboration  reimburses us for our costs of supplying chips and reagents to agilent and pays us a share of the gross margin earned on all components of labchip systems they sell 
we record revenue from development and support activities under our collaboration agreement in the period in which the costs are incurred 
we report direct costs associated with this contract as research and development expense 
we recognize revenue related to the reimbursement of costs for the supply of chips and reagents to agilent upon shipment and we recognize the related costs as components of cost of sales 
we recognize as revenue our share of gross margin on components of the systems sold by agilent upon shipment to the end user 
in may  we notified agilent of our election to terminate the agreement between the companies  effective as of may if we do not enter into a new agreement before that time  then under the existing agreement  the parties relationship would change  including as follows we could cease to receive development funding for new products  we will grant agilent a non exclusive  royalty bearing license to use the lab on a chip technologies that we have developed up to that time in order to develop  make and sell products in substantially the same field that applied during the collaboration  upon request by agilent  we will also transfer chip manufacturing know how over a limited period of time  and we will receive royalties on agilent s sales of systems that employ our patented technologies 
after the collaboration agreement terminates in may  our gross margin share for existing products will remain the same until november in november  our gross margin share for chips and reagents will decrease  and in may our gross margin share for chips and reagents will decrease again 
our gross margin share for existing instruments will also decrease in the same time periods  although at somewhat different rates 
upon termination of the agreement in may  agilent will have a non exclusive license in the field of the collaboration to caliper s then existing labchip technology to develop  manufacture and sell new products in that field 
agilent will be required to pay royalties to caliper based on its net revenue from sales of such products at the established royalty rates set forth in the termination provisions of our collaboration agreement 
beginning in november  caliper will have the right to market and sell collaboration products  with reciprocal supply arrangements with agilent 
our principal motivation in terminating the formal agreement with agilent was to give us more flexibility in commercializing new products with other commercial partners 
termination of the agreement will also provide caliper with greater ability to market and sell existing products in the field of the collaboration directly to end user customers  in part utilizing the reciprocal supply arrangements set forth in the termination provisions of the agreement 
both parties will either operate under the existing termination provisions of the collaboration agreement or establish new terms  as yet to be determined 
given the success of the agilent bioanalyzer products and the changing relationship between caliper and agilent  we are actively working to expand the number and scope of our commercial partnerships 
increasing the number and scope of commercial partnerships 
during  we expanded our business development activities in order to pursue additional commercial partnerships 
a core element of our business strategy is to broaden our network of commercial partners  accessing new applications and new markets 
we believe that this will allow us to more effectively leverage the commercial potential of microfluidics in ways 
table of contents that would be difficult to achieve  from both a research investment and infrastructure perspective  for a young company 
this strategy allows us to combine our proprietary technical expertise with a partner who has complementary capabilities 
these types of collaborations diminish our risk and reduce our costs while leveraging larger  established partners strengths to tap new markets 
as we create new relationships of this type  we expect the financial implications for us to be modest in the early years primarily product development funding until product revenues are generated  beginning generally in the second or third year of a relationship 
planned entry into molecular diagnostics 
in december  we entered into an agreement with bacterial barcodes  inc bbci to co distribute molecular diagnostic systems based on our microfluidic labchip technology and bbci s proprietary molecular identification and dna fingerprinting technology known as rep pcr repetitive sequence based polymerase chain reaction 
as part of this collaboration  we developed the caliper analyzer system in the caliper  which is manufactured by agilent on an oem basis  is being used with bbci s proprietary rep pcr products to generate dna fingerprints of bacteria for microbial typing and identification applications 
the combined caliper bbci system is in the final stages of field testing 
customer response at the testing sites has been positive  and we anticipate a product rollout in bbci initially has targeted laboratories involved in epidemiology testing  such as reference laboratories and facilities in large hospitals 
a clinical product  requiring regulatory approval  is also planned for which bbci will manage the required submissions to the food and drug administration 
under our agreement  caliper will provide chips and analysis reagents to bbci 
bbci will sell a combined assay kit that includes our chips and their rep pcr dna fingerprinting reagents and protocols  plus software to access bbci s database of bacterial dna fingerprints 
we will market and sell the caliper analyzer designed to run these chips either directly or through distribution channel partners 
intellectual property 
key to our business strategy has also been the development of an extensive intellectual property portfolio 
consistent with this strategy  we have protected our patent portfolio as appropriate  this included litigation with aclara biosciences aclara 
in january  we announced a comprehensive settlement agreement with aclara on all pending litigation between the two companies 
as a result  aclara agreed to pay us million over a three year period in a combination of stock  cash and committed minimum royalties 
as of december   we have collected million of this settlement with the remaining million for minimum royalties payable in during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an amendment and restatement of our existing license agreements with ut battelle  llc under which we had obtained an exclusive license to the patents covering the inventions of dr 
j 
michael ramsey 
although we have minimum royalty obligations under this license agreement  its earned royalty payments exceeded the required minimum royalty for royalty payments were  in we anticipate that its earned royalty obligation in future years will continue to exceed the minimum required royalty 
we also have an exclusive license from the trustees of the university of pennsylvania to certain patents relating to microfluidic applications and chip structures 
we anticipate that during the next several years the minimum royalty obligation under this license will exceed the earned royalty obligation 
the minimum royalty obligation under this license rises over time  but never exceeds  per year 
reduction in force 
in july  due to the broader economic slowdown and a widely reported reduction in research and development spending by biopharmaceutical companies that we believed was affecting caliper s sales to customers  we began a detailed strategic review of our business 
this process included evaluating each of our products and programs for commercial opportunity  time to market and resource requirements 
as a result of that review  in september  we conducted a reduction in force that resulted in a downsizing of our employee work force by people  or approximately 
the reduction was primarily in our research and development staff where we changed the focus of our product development and technology research to align more with the changing needs of our customers 
we recognized a charge of  in for severance payments and related benefits all of which were paid by the end of the calendar year 
we expect to realize approximately million in annualized savings from this employee downsizing action 
the strategic review also served as the basis of our budget planning process and 
table of contents continues to be utilized to allocate resources within caliper 
we anticipate making further expense reductions to better align our discretionary spending activities with revenue growth 
stock option exchange 
in october  we commenced a voluntary stock option exchange program for regular employees of the company 
this program seeks to align employee and stockholder interests while sustaining high levels of employee performance through what has been a lengthy stagnant economic period 
a considerable number of our employees option exercise prices are significantly higher than the current market price of caliper common stock  and the program is intended to address this situation 
our board and management believe that this program will help motivate and retain our employees 
under the program  eligible employees had the opportunity to exchange certain unexercised stock options for new options to be granted at least six months and one day following the cancellation of the exchanged options 
the unexercised stock options that were tendered for exchange under the stock option exchange program was for  shares 
the new options will be exercisable for an equal number of shares as the exchanged options 
the exercise price of the new options will be equal to the most recent closing share price of caliper common stock at the time of the new option grants  which is expected to be on or about may  the offer of the option exchange commenced on october   and expired on november  looking ahead 
since our inception  caliper has incurred significant losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development  manufacturing scale up  product research and commercialization and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect to continue to incur substantial research and development  product commercialization  manufacturing scale up and general and administrative costs 
as a result  we will need to generate significantly higher revenue to achieve profitability 
as we look to the future  our primary corporate focus remains unchanged 
during  we intend to create market traction in our direct product sales  add new commercial partners  and continue improving the quality of our existing products 
there are a number of milestones that will provide evidence of our sustained progress in these areas 
for the caliper drug discovery system  we intend to expand the number of applications available to customers 
it is also our intention to expand our customer base  as well as to increase usage by existing customers 
we also plan to initiate multiple new commercial partnerships  and advance those currently in existence 
this includes launching the caliper analyzer and increasing revenues from the agilent collaboration 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was recently released by the securities and exchange commission  recommends all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
see note to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document for a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by caliper 
our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses  and assets and liabilities during the periods reported 
estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as warranty expense  sales and marketing programs  employee compensation programs  depreciation and amortization periods  taxes  inventory values  and valuations of investments and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates due to changing conditions or the validity of our assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize instrument  labchip products  datapoint and service support revenues on shipment or when the related services are performed  as applicable  net of credits and adjustments for discounts 
in instances where we have customers who have requested acceptance provisions  no revenue is 
table of contents recognized until such customer acceptance has been obtained 
in connection with our adoption of the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  we have changed our method of accounting effective january to recognize all customer support and service fees over the term of the related agreement 
customer and accounts receivables 
we currently have an allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  based on the aging of our accounts receivable balances and our historical experience of defaults and write offs 
if the financial condition of our customers were to further deteriorate  we will need to add to this allowance for doubtful accounts the estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
inventory write offs 
we make inventory commitment and purchase decisions based upon sales forecasts 
to mitigate the component supply constraints that have existed in the past and to fill orders with non standard configurations  we build inventory levels for certain items with long lead times and enter into certain longer term commitments for certain items 
we permanently write off of the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excessive to fulfill future sales estimates 
we define obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is determined using our best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand for current or committed inventory levels 
we use a twelve month demand forecast and  in addition to the demand forecast  we also consider parts and subassemblies that can be used in alternative finished products  parts and subassemblies that are unlikely to be engineered out of our products  and known design changes which would reduce our ability to use the inventory as planned 
significant differences between our estimates and judgments regarding future volume and mix of customer demand for our products and actual volume and demand mix may result in additional write offs in the future 
depreciation 
when recording depreciation expense associated with our production and microfluidic equipment  we use estimated useful lives based on the utility and service life of the equipment 
as a result of changes in technology and industry conditions  we periodically evaluate the useful lives of our production and microfluidic equipment 
these evaluations could result in a change in useful lives in future periods 
warranty expense 
at the time revenue is recognized  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenue 
our standard warranty period extends months from the date of sale on the automated drug discovery systems and months on chips 
our warranty accrual represents our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty accrual is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what actually transpire in the future 
if our actual warranty costs are greater than the accrual  costs of revenue will increase in the future 
related party 
we have an ownership interest of approximately in one entity  amphora  for which we apply the equity method of accounting 
our investment in amphora has no basis for accounting purposes and  because we do not guarantee debt or have commitments to fund any of amphora s losses  we have not recorded any proportionate share of amphora s operating losses in our financial statements since the completion of amphora s financing 
amphora is a major customer representing approximately of our total revenue in our investment in amphora has no basis for accounting purposes and we do not guarantee debt or have any commitments to fund amphora s losses 
all significant accounts and transactions with amphora are disclosed as related party transactions 
in  we sold a total of million in caliper drug discovery system products  labchip products  datapoints and assay development services to amphora  recording the sales as related party revenue in our financial statements 
under the equity accounting method  caliper recorded million in related party product sales and deferred of the gross profit  or  that reflects caliper s retained ownership interest in the products sold to amphora in the remaining million of revenue recognized in consisted of million in datapoints   in assay development services and deferred gross profit revenue from caliper drug discovery system product 
table of contents sales in and in  we recognized a total of  of this deferred gross profit as revenue of which  related to drug discovery system products sold to amphora in and  related to products sold in we expect to recognize the remaining  as revenue ratably over the next months through september as amphora records depreciation on its caliper drug discovery systems 
as all automated drug discovery system sales to amphora occurred prior to amphora s december third party financing  all future drug discovery system sales will be deferred at our then retained ownership interest level which is approximately currently 
we have no guarantees of balance sheet debt of third parties and we have no debt obligations that contain provisions requiring accelerated payment in the event of specified levels of declines in liquidity or profitability 
we do not have any special purpose entities in place 
derivatives 
in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we recognize derivative financial instruments in the financial statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument 
we recognize changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments either periodically in income or in stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income loss depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting  and if so  whether it is designated as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedge ie  hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk  we recognize the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk in current earnings during the period of the change in fair values 
we entered into a settlement agreement with aclara in march  the terms of which provided that if were to sell any of the  shares of aclara s common stock received in the settlement between and months from the effective date of the settlement agreement  and the then fair value of aclara s stock is less than per share  aclara agreed to pay us in cash a dollar amount equal to the difference between the aggregate fair value of the aclara stock at the date the shares are disposed and million 
if the then fair value of the aclara stock was greater than per share  we would have received no additional consideration from aclara 
we were restricted from selling our shares of aclara for months following the effective date of the settlement agreement 
if we were to sell the shares of aclara stock at any time after months from the effective date of the settlement agreement  aclara would have no obligation to provide any additional consideration to us 
aclara executed a fully funded million standby letter of credit in favor of caliper to secure its performance under this potential obligation 
in effect  aclara had guaranteed the aggregate settlement amount of million  so long as we were to sell our aclara stock within a specified period of time 
we accounted for this arrangement by initially recording million in aclara stock at fair market value  with a note receivable with a corresponding face value of million for the fully funded letter of credit which was reduced by the initial fair value million of an embedded derivative 
the embedded derivative was designated as a fair value hedge of the aclara stock 
the mark to market change in the fair value of the aclara stock was recorded in earnings in the other income or expense line on the statement of operations and offset by the gains or losses in the fair value of the derivative reported in the same other income or expense line 
the ineffective portion of the embedded derivative was also recorded in the other income or expense line on the statement of operations 
on october  we received million in cash from aclara and surrendered the  shares of aclara common stock effectively completing the settlement transaction 
as of december   we have no derivative financial instruments 
stock options 
we have elected to continue to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock based compensation apb to account for employee stock options because the alternative fair value method of accounting prescribed by sfas no 
requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed or use in valuing employee stock options 
under apb  no compensation expense is recognized because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
deferred compensation  if recorded  is amortized using the graded vesting method 
statement of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas requires the disclosure of pro forma information regarding net 
table of contents loss and net loss per share as if we had accounted for its stock options under the fair value method 
see summary of significant accounting policies note to the financial statements for further discussion 
we account for stock option grants to non employees in accordance with the emerging issues task force consensus no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  which requires the options subject to vesting to be periodically re valued and expensed over their vesting periods 
deferred tax assets 
we have deferred tax assets related to net operating losses generated in the united states 
our accounting policy is to record valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
at december   we had deferred tax assets related to net operating losses of million and a valuation allowance of million to equally offset those assets as our lack of earnings history and the uncertainty of realizing these net operating losses significantly limits our ability to realize this tax asset 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
revenue decreased to million in from million in of the million decrease  we had increased growth of million from increased product sales to commercial customers  including amphora  a related party  and from our collaboration with agilent offset by a decrease of million in license and contract fees from an anticipated decline related to the discontinuation in of our technology access program 
related party revenue increased to million in as compared to million in this increase resulted from sales to amphora of million in caliper drug discovery system products  million in datapoints and  in assay development services in as compared to million in caliper drug discovery system products   in minimum datapoints revenues and  in assay development services in based on the december restructured relationship with amphora  we expect in that amphora will purchase only one caliper instrument and make approximately million in minimum datapoint payments to us 
product revenue from unrelated customers increased to million in as compared to million in this increase of million is mainly from product volume growth under our commercial collaboration with agilent  with sales of our caliper drug discovery systems up only modestly 
product revenue increased in under our commercial collaboration with agilent driven by the agilent bioanalyzer unit sales increase of and labchip kit growth of over the same period in in  we expect continued unit growth in the agilent bioanalyzer product line 
we estimate bioanalyzer instrument sales to grow by to  while the number of labchip kits sold are expected to increase by to 
product revenues from sales of our drug discovery system products increased in driven by increased datapoint revenues of  as compared to none in offset by caliper drug discovery systems product sales declining in as compared to additionally  product revenues in from sales of the ams were essentially unchanged as compared to while product revenues from the caliper system declined in it has been widely reported that the sluggish economic environment  coupled with pharmaceutical industry specific factors  has dampened research spending for many companies 
as such  continuing market acceptance of our products will depend on our ability to demonstrate the advantages and potential economic value of our drug discovery systems in the context of decreased capital spending by our customers 
license fees and contract revenues decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease of million resulted mainly from the million received in licensing fees in for the ramsey family of patents to aclara as opposed to million in  a million decline in our technology access program contract revenue  and a  decline in government contracted research offset by a million increase in product support services on caliper s commercialized ams and applications developer program services 
the decline in our technology access program revenue in was a result of our conversion from a fee based technology access program model in september to a 
table of contents commercial drug discovery products business 
also  contract fee revenues under our collaboration with agilent declined to million in as we concluded several development programs related to the agilent bioanalyzer product line 
development program contract fees under our collaboration with agilent could cease at any time after the termination of the formal agreement in may however  we anticipate that some product development contract fees will continue as we are working steadily with agilent to develop new products 
cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue represents manufacturing costs incurred in the microfluidic chip and instrument production process  including component materials  assembly labor and overhead  packaging and delivery cost 
cost of products sold was million in for the related party sales to amphora as compared to million in of this  increase   related to increased cost for warranty repairs and service costs driven by the increased number of our products in operation at amphora   related to higher component costs with the remainder driven by product mix due to increased labchip product volume offset by a decline in the number of drug discovery systems purchased in as compared to as a result  profit margins for product sales to amphora were in as compared to for each of the same periods in profit margins were positively impacted by a million increase in datapoint revenue in as compared to offset by the added volume discounts earned by amphora due to its higher accumulated instrument purchases during the course of the year 
the profit margins on product sales to amphora will continue to vary due to the volume of products purchased with their corresponding commercial volume discounts earned and due to datapoint revenue that has minimal associated costs to caliper 
cost of all other products sold were million for compared to million in product costs increased during by million 
of this amount   was largely as a result of component replacement cost under our product warranty provisions driven by the increased number of our products in the market 
as we only began to commercially market our products in september  there were no warranty costs incurred in although warranty costs are common in our business and affect our profit margins variably during the year  we do not anticipate component replacements such as those that occurred throughout to continue at these levels indefinitely 
additionally in  we wrote off  in excess or obsolete inventory materials 
profit margins from product sales to unrelated customers declined overall to in as compared to in in addition to the warranty and inventory costs already noted  profit margins were also adversely impacted in by the increased volume of agilent bioanalyzer systems sold  which carry lower margins  and lower sales of caliper s own products 
product mix will affect future profit margins as caliper earns a higher return from its own products sold as opposed to sharing gross margin revenues on collaboration products with agilent 
datapoint revenue will also affect profit margins from unrelated customers as it has minimal associated costs to caliper 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for chip development  material costs for prototype and test units  legal expenses resulting from intellectual property prosecution and litigation  and other expenses related to the design  development  testing  and enhancement of our products 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses increased to million during from million in the increase of million was primarily attributable to continued growth of research and development activities  consisting of million related to increased personnel and services to support our expanded next generation drug discovery system and microfluidic chip development  partner collaboration and product scale up   for supplies required to assemble  build and test prototype labchip systems   for costs related to intellectual property matters and million due to expansion in research facilities  equipment and activities 
our research and development focus has been on product development in the areas of new applications  microfluidic instruments with expanded capabilities  our librarycard system and genomic analysis systems 
in the future  we intend to focus for our labchip technology development efforts on a narrow range of applications based on customer demand 
we also will continue to make investments intended to advance and refine our manufacturing processes in order to improve the functionality and reliability of our chips and instruments 
we expect to continue our efforts in these areas of research and development even though the outcomes of these projects are inherently uncertain 
we will also continue to revise our research and 
table of contents development focus and priorities to match the economic climate and the research and development spending by biopharmaceutical companies that we believe will affect the demand for our microfluidic products 
we expect research and development spending to decline in as compared to as a result of our downsizing in september and reduced discretionary spending with our research and product development efforts  only expanding in subsequent years based on customer demand  market conditions and our commercial growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  sales and marketing  finance and other administrative personnel  recruiting expenses  professional fees  and other corporate expenses including business development and general legal activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million during from million in the increase of million was due primarily to an increase of  related to employment costs for sales and marketing mostly due to our first full year of a commercial marketing and sales function   for general legal fees related to expanded commercial initiatives   in increase insurance and license fees to support our commercially marketed products and expanded operating facilities   for market research  advertising and services to support our commercialized products and  for expanded facility operating costs offset by a  decline in outside consulting services 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to moderate over the next several years increasing only to support demonstrated business growth or for activities required to further commercialize our products 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
deferred stock compensation represents the difference  at the date of grant  between the deemed fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes and the exercise price of options 
during and  we recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million 
this amount is being amortized over the respective vesting periods of the individual stock options using the graded vesting method 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation  net of  in as compared to million in the deferred stock compensation  net consisted of million  offset by a reversal of million in of stock compensation expense recognized in previous periods resulting from forfeited options from the approximate reduction in force and other employee terminations 
we expect to record amortization expense for deferred compensation of  during and  during the amount of deferred compensation expense to be recorded in future periods may further decrease if unvested options for which deferred compensation has been recorded are subsequently canceled 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges represent the severance and related benefits paid to terminated employees as a result of the reduction in force conducted in september due to the broader economic slowdown and reduced research and development spending by biopharmaceutical companies that we believed was affecting our sales to customers  we began in july a detailed strategic review in which we evaluated each of our products and programs for commercial opportunity  time to market and resource requirements 
in september  to better align our organizational structure with these depressed market conditions and customer demand  we conducted a reduction in force that resulted in a downsizing of our employee work force by employees  or approximately  concluding with employees 
of the employees affected by the reduction in force  were in research and development with the remaining divided equally between manufacturing and administrative functions 
we recorded a charge of  for this reduction in force completing all the restructuring activity by december  we had no restructuring charges in prior periods 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net consists of income from our cash and investments offset by expenses related to our financing obligations 
interest income  net was million in as compared to million in the decrease primarily resulted from lower cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances ratably during the months of as compared to the same monthly periods in and  to a lesser extent  the declining interest rate yields in as compared to last year 
litigation settlement and reimbursement 
there were no litigation settlements  reimbursement of fees or expenses in in january  we recognized million in a litigation settlement resulting from a 
table of contents comprehensive settlement agreement with aclara for the dismissal of all suits and countersuits between the two companies 
income taxes 
as of december   we had federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and california research and other development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning on through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be substantially limited due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
as of december  and we had deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
the net valuation allowance increased by million during the year ended december  the net valuation allowance decreased by  during the year ended december  deferred tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards  research credit carryforwards  and capitalized research and development costs 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased to million in from million in of the million increase  million was derived from increased product sales to commercial customers  including amphora  a related party  and from our collaboration with agilent 
related party revenue was million for resulting from sales of million in caliper drug discovery system products   in datapoints and  in assay development services to amphora in subsequent to amphora s third party financing 
there were no related party revenues in product revenue from unrelated customers increased to million in  compared to million in this increase of million is from product volume growth under our commercial collaboration with agilent  and from sales of our caliper drug discovery system launched in september and the ams and applications developer program  both of which were introduced in march product revenue increased in under our commercial collaboration with agilent driven by the agilent bioanalyzer unit sales increase of over the same period in product revenues from sales of our drug discovery systems increased in driven by the commercial launch of the caliper drug discovery system  the ams and the caliper system 
additionally  we experienced this increase in part due to our conversion from a fee based technology access program model to a commercial drug discovery products business and the associated change in revenue recognition methods 
license fees and contract revenues increased to million in compared to million in the increase of million resulted mainly from the million licensing fee for the ramsey family of patents to aclara in connection with our litigation settlement with aclara  and a  increase in product support services on caliper s newly commercialized ams and applications developer program services offset by a million decline in our technology access program contract revenue 
we experienced this decline in our technology access program revenue in as a result of our conversion from a fee based technology access program model to a commercial drug discovery products business 
also  contract fee revenues under our collaboration with agilent declined principally from a one time  research and development reimbursement in excluding this one time reimbursement  contract fees in under the collaboration with agilent were essentially unchanged from cost of product revenue 
cost of products sold was million for the related party sales to amphora for the profit margins on product sales to amphora vary due to the volume of products purchased and the corresponding commercial volume discounts earned and due to datapoint revenue that has minimal associated costs to caliper 
cost of all other products sold were million for compared to million in the improved profit margins from product sales to unrelated customers in compared to was primarily due to the increased volume of agilent bioanalyzer systems sold and sales of caliper s own products 

table of contents research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million during from million in the increase of million was primarily attributable to continued growth of research and development activities  including million related to increased personnel and services to support our expanded next generation drug discovery system and microfluidic chip development  partner collaboration and product scale up  million for supplies required to assemble  build and test prototype labchip systems and million due to expansion in research facilities and activities  offset by a reduction of million for costs related to intellectual property matters  primarily legal fees due to the settlement with aclara 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million during from million in the increase of million was due primarily to million related to employment costs for marketing  general and administrative personnel  million for general legal fees related to expanded commercial initiatives   for market research and services to support our initial product launches and  for expanded operating facilities 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of million for  million for and million for interest income expense  net 
net interest income increased to million in from net interest income of million in this increase primarily resulted from interest on proceeds of the million raised in august from the sale of  shares of common stock in a private placement offset in part by generally declining interest rate yields in litigation settlement and reimbursement 
in january  we recognized million in a litigation settlement resulting from a comprehensive settlement agreement with aclara for the dismissal of all suits and countersuits between the two companies 
in  we received million in a litigation settlement resulting from a settlement agreement with a former patent attorney and his former law firm 
of the million recognized in  million was a settlement with bertram rowland and the law firm of flehr  hohbach  test  albritton and herbert llp in a breach of fiduciary duty and trade secret misappropriation case 
the remainder relates to reimbursement of litigation fees and expenses from one of our collaborators 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations from inception primarily through equity sales  product sales and services  contract and milestone payments to us under our collaboration and technology access program agreements  the million received from the comprehensive settlement agreement with aclara  and equipment financing under sale leaseback arrangements 
as of december   we had received net proceeds of million from issuances of common and preferred stock which primarily includes million raised in august from the sale of  shares of common stock in a private placement and million raised from our initial public offering in december from inception through december  we had received million from collaborations  product sales and services  technology access program customers and government grants and had financed equipment purchases and leasehold improvements totaling approximately million 
we have used leases and loans to finance capital expenditures under sales leaseback arrangements 
as of december   we had million in capitalized lease obligations 
these obligations are secured by the equipment financed  bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate of approximately  and are due in monthly installments through june under the terms of one equipment sale leaseback agreement  the financed equipment may be purchased by us at a fair value at the end of the financing term 
other equipment sale leaseback agreements require a balloon payment at the end of each loan term 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  as compared to million as of december  we used million for operations in this consisted of working capital changes of million offset by the net loss for the period of million and by non cash charges of million related to amortization of deferred stock compensation  stock options issued to non employees  and depreciation and amortization expense 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  as compared to million as of 
table of contents december  we used million for operations in this consisted of working capital changes of million offset by the net income for the period of million and by non cash charges of million related to amortization of deferred stock compensation  stock options issued to non employees  and depreciation and amortization expense 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for  consisting primarily of million of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities offset in part by million of capital expenditures and of million of purchases of available for sale investments 
we received  from financing activities for  which consisted principally of million raised in the issuance of common stock due to employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases and  from equipment sale leaseback arrangements  offset in part by repayments of equipment sale leaseback arrangements of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for  consisting primarily of million of capital expenditures and of million of purchases of available for sale investments  offset in part by proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale investments 
we received million from financing activities for  which consisted principally of million raised in the issuance of common stock due to employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases and million from equipment sale leaseback arrangements  offset in part by repayments of equipment sale leaseback arrangements of million 
through june   we drew down  of the million remaining balance of the million equipment sale leaseback credit line which existed as of december  at a weighted average interest rate of 
the drawdown period under this million equipment sale leaseback credit line expired on june  as of december   we drew down approximately million in total under a new line at a weighted average interest rate of and had  unused that expired under this arrangement on july  we did not renew this sale leaseback arrangement and have no similar financing credit line in place as of december  as of december   we had million in capitalized lease obligations outstanding compared to million at december  we had commitments under non cancelable operating leases  reduced by minimum sublease income in the case of operating leases  of million to be paid through the following is a table of our commitments obligations under operating sale leaseback leases arrangements in thousands years ending december thereafter total minimum lease and principal payments as of december   we also had a non cancelable purchase commitment in the amount of approximately  with our foreign supplier for the purchase of our proprietary glass stock used in the manufacture of certain types of our chips 
we have minimum royalty obligations under separate license agreements with ut battelle  llc and the trustees of the university of pennsylvania 
royalty payments to ut battelle were  in and are expected to exceed the required minimum royalty amount in and through the remainder of the license 
we anticipate that during the next several years of the license with the trustees of the university of pennsylvania that the minimum royalty obligation under this license will exceed the earned royalty obligation 
the minimum royalty obligation under this license rises over time  but never exceeds  per year 
based on our long term strategic plan  we believe that our current cash balances  together with the revenue to be derived from our commercial partners and from the commercial sale of our microfluidic 
table of contents products and services will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  among others  continued market acceptance of our microfluidic products  continued scientific progress in our microfluidic research and product development programs  the magnitude and scope of our research and product development programs  our ability to maintain existing  and establish additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  the time and costs involved in expanding and maintaining our manufacturing facilities  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products  and other factors not within our control 
actual capital expenditures could vary considerably  however  depending on opportunities that arise over the course of the and period 
in addition  we intend to seek additional funding through new oem collaborations and commercial partnerships or additional capital sale leaseback transactions 
during or after this period  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to reduce our research and development efforts  or sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit arrangements 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the inability to obtain additional financing may force delays in research and product development activities and  ultimately  cause us to cease operations 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation and changing prices on our operations was not significant during the periods presented 
related party transactions in may  we formed amphora  later transferring certain intangibles in september of that year 
in september  amphora completed a private placement of securities with third party investors raising million which reduced our ownership to 
in connection with this september financing  we received the right to appoint two representatives to amphora s six member board of directors 
these two members were michael r 
knapp  then our vice president of corporate development  and james l 
knighton  then our executive vice president and chief financial officer 
mr 
knighton resigned from amphora s board of directors in february and was replaced by daniel l 
kisner  caliper s board chairman  in may mr 
knighton also served as amphora s acting chief financial officer from september until january in connection with the formation of amphora  dr 
knapp and mr 
knighton received  and  shares of restricted common stock  respectively  at a share value of per share 
dr 
knapp and mr 
knighton paid per share of the purchase price in cash  with the remainder of the purchase price paid by the cancellation of all amounts owed by amphora to dr 
knapp and mr 
knighton for services provided by them to amphora prior to the issuance of such common shares to them 
initially  of such shares were subject to a repurchase option in favor of amphora 
of such shares were released from this repurchase option when amphora completed its initial third party financing in september the remaining of such shares will be ratably released from amphora s repurchase option over an eight year period on a monthly basis with respect to each of dr 
knapp or mr 
knighton for so long as they serve on amphora s board or remain available to provide advisory services to amphora pursuant to existing consulting contracts 
additionally  dr 
knapp participated as a private investor in amphora s initial september financing  where he purchased  shares of amphora s preferred stock 
dr 
kisner did 
table of contents not receive any shares of restricted amphora common stock or options to buy amphora common stock in connection with his appointment to amphora s board 
in december  amphora completed a second private placement of securities with third party investors 
after the completion of this financing  caliper s ownership in amphora was reduced on a fully diluted basis to approximately as of december  from as of december  over time we expect that our ownership in amphora will be further diluted  as we have no plans to make any future equity investments in amphora 
on march   one of caliper s two representatives  dr 
michael r 
knapp  resigned from amphora s board of directors 
due to the reduction in our percentage ownership of amphora  we now have the right to appoint only one member to amphora s board 
dr 
kisner continues to be a member of amphora s board of directors 
in september  we entered into a labchip solutions agreement and an intellectual property agreement with amphora 
the labchip solutions agreement provides for the ongoing supply of our drug discovery systems and chips to amphora  and for the provision of related services by us to amphora 
under this agreement  amphora agreed to purchase a minimum of eleven caliper drug discovery systems by december  and at least eleven additional caliper drug discovery systems by december  amphora also agreed to purchase datapoints at a fixed amount of million in the first year and a minimum of million to a maximum based on volume of million in the second year of the agreement 
under the intellectual property agreement  we granted amphora certain exclusive rights to use our drug discovery products in a chemical genomics database business 
in connection with the completion of amphora s december financing  caliper and amphora agreed to a renegotiation of amphora s obligations under the labchip solutions agreement 
under the renegotiated agreement  the companies agreed to restructure the million minimum datapoint payment for as follows amphora agreed to purchase a minimum of million of datapoints during the second year of the agreement beginning in december and over time to make up to million of deferred payments to caliper 
these deferred payments are contingent upon amphora s future revenue generation  datapoint production and other conditions and can be satisfied by amphora under three methods i quarterly payments to caliper based on amphora s revenues  ii commissions earned by amphora as they provide certain marketing assistance to caliper for caliper s instruments  and iii additional datapoint payments if amphora exceeds the certain minimum datapoint levels 
we also agreed to defer to december  amphora s obligation to purchase the one remaining caliper instrument of the originally scheduled to be purchased by amphora before december  in consideration for our agreement to this restructuring  amphora issued to caliper million shares of amphora preferred stock 
we ascribed a nominal value of  to these shares as amphora is a privately held research and development company 
in  we sold a total of million in caliper drug discovery system products  chips  datapoints and assay development services to amphora recording the sale of products and services as related party revenue in our financial statements 
in by comparison  subsequent to amphora s initial financing in september  we sold a total of million in caliper drug discovery system products  chips  datapoints and assay development services 
the completion of amphora s second financing in december did not have any impact on our method of accounting for sales to amphora 
in december  amphora assumed full service responsibility for all of the caliper drug discovery instruments purchased from caliper including instruments still within their month warranty period 
in return  caliper provided a  warranty rebate on the caliper drug discovery instruments purchased earlier in and will provide a fixed discount on future sales of instruments purchased without a warranty 
caliper has no remaining warranty or service responsibility on instruments purchased now or in the future by amphora 
in september  amphora entered into a three year sublease agreement with caliper for the rent of approximately  square feet in one of caliper s three mountain view  ca leased buildings for amphora s research and development use 
amphora is obligated for monthly rent based on local market rates with a per annum escalation and we  as landlord  are obligated to provide certain facilities maintenance services 
in december  in connection with the completion of amphora s second financing  we agreed to an early 
table of contents termination of this sublease agreement as of march  in september  we also entered into an administrative services agreement with amphora for certain financial accounting  purchasing and human resource services to be provided by our personnel 
we charged for these services monthly at an hourly rate based on a cost plus mark up basis recording the corresponding payments from amphora as part of our overall employee costs 
amphora terminated this agreement at its option in june when it achieved adequate staffing to fulfill these functions 
recent accounting pronouncements in june the financial accounting services board fasb  issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
states that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for a liability for one time termination benefits that are incurred over a period of time 
the standard will be effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the provisions of statement are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated exit activities  and may affect the timing of recognition of future restructuring costs  as well as amounts recognized 
in november  the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued interpretation no 
or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including residual value guarantees issued in conjunction with operating lease agreements 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  our adoption of the recognition and measurement of fin are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
see the warranty expense note in the notes to consolidated financial statements of part ii  item of this form k regarding our warranty related disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have included the required additional disclosures in note to our condensed consolidated financial statements and do not expect sfas to have an effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  fin applies to public enterprises as of the beginning of the applicable interim or annual period 
we do not believe there will be a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations from the adoption of the provisions of fin 
table of contents in january  the emerging issues task force published eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which requires companies to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria 
arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this issue will have on our results of operations and or financial position 
factors affecting operating results risks related to our business our labchip systems may not achieve market acceptance  which could cause our revenue to grow slowly or decline 
many of our technologies are still in the early stages of development  and our drug discovery systems incorporating these technologies have only recently been made commercially available 
if our drug discovery systems do not gain further market acceptance  we will be unable to generate significant sales and our revenue will decline 
the commercial success of our drug discovery systems will depend upon capital spending by our potential customers  and market acceptance of the merits of our drug discovery systems by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic research centers and other companies that rely upon laboratory experimentation 
market acceptance will depend on many factors  including our ability to demonstrate the advantages and potential economic value of our drug discovery systems over alternative well established technologies and products  capital spending by our customers and potential customers  which has decreased as a result of the current economic conditions and other industry specific factors  and our ability to market our drug discovery systems 
because the products comprising our drug discovery systems have been in operation for a limited period of time  their accuracy  reliability  ease of use and commercial value have not been fully established 
if the first customers do not approve of our initial drug discovery systems because these systems fail to generate the quantities and quality of data they expect  are too difficult or costly to use  or are otherwise deficient  market acceptance of these drug discovery systems would suffer and further sales may be limited 
we cannot assure you that these customers efforts to put our drug discovery systems into use will continue or will be expeditious or effective 
potential customers for our drug discovery systems may also wait for indications from our initial drug discovery system customers that our drug discovery systems work effectively and generate substantial benefits 
further  non acceptance by the market of our initial drug discovery systems could undermine not only those systems but subsequent drug discovery systems as well 
if we do not successfully introduce new products and expand the range of applications for our drug discovery systems  we may experience a decline in revenue or slow revenue growth and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we intend to continue developing lower cost drug discovery systems with enhanced features that address existing or emerging customer needs such as novel assay functionalities 
if we are unable to do so  our drug discovery systems may not become widely used and we may experience a decline in revenue or slow revenue growth and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we must continue to develop applications for our drug discovery systems 
we currently have several assays in development including assays that measure many important activities of cells and proteins 
we are developing line extensions that are particularly well suited for the evaluation of kinases  one of the largest focus areas of drug discovery efforts today 
we are creating new tools to make it 
table of contents easier for our customers to develop their own custom assays in a microfluidic format 
caliper is also developing kinase profiling and selectivity screening kits 
if we are not able to complete the development of these applications and tools  or if we experience difficulties or delays  we may lose our current customers and may not be able to obtain new customers 
we expect to incur future operating losses and may not achieve profitability 
we have experienced significant operating losses each year since our inception and expect to incur substantial additional operating losses for at least the next two years  primarily as a result of a current sluggish economic climate  dampened research spending for many companies affecting our product sales and expected continuing expenses for manufacturing capabilities  research and product development costs and general and administrative costs 
we may not achieve profitability in future years 
for example  we experienced net losses of approximately million in  million in  million in  a net profit of million earned in followed by a net loss of million in without our litigation settlement and reimbursement of million in  we would have also had a net loss in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development  product marketing and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
these costs have exceeded our litigation settlement and reimbursement  interest income and revenue which  to date  have been generated principally from product sales  collaborative research and development agreements  technology access fees  cash and investment balances and  to a lesser extent  government grants 
our operating results fluctuate significantly and any failure to meet financial expectations may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect they will fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  some of which are outside of our control 
for example  our revenues have varied dramatically as a result of new customers joining our technology access program  the subsequent switching to a commercial products business from a technology access model and product shipments 
it is possible that in some future quarter or quarters  our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock may fall abruptly and significantly 
because our revenue and operating results are difficult to predict  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indication of our future performance 
if revenue declines in a quarter  whether due to a delay in recognizing expected revenue or otherwise  our earnings will decline because many of our expenses are relatively fixed 
in particular  research and development and general and administrative expenses and amortization of deferred stock compensation are not affected directly by variations in revenue 
because a small number of customers and agilent have accounted for  and are likely to continue to account for  a substantial portion of our revenue  our revenue could decline due to the loss of one of these customers or the termination of our agreement with agilent 
historically  we have had very few customers and one commercial partner  agilent  from which we have derived the majority of our revenue and  if we were to lose any one of these  our revenue would decrease substantially 
in  agilent represented of total revenues and amphora accounted for of total revenues with three of caliper s previous technology access program customers combined accounted for of total revenues 
agilent  our technology access program customers  amphora and our initial licensing of the ramsey family of patents to aclara in connection with our litigation settlement with them  accounted for of our total revenue for the year ended december  agilent and three customers accounted for of total revenue for the year ended december  although we anticipate that future sales of the agilent bioanalyzer system will further expand our revenue base  we expect that we will continue to rely on a few customers and on agilent for the majority of our revenues 

table of contents we are still early in the process of converting some customers from technology access program agreements to purchasers of products and support services  and our revenue could be adversely impacted by this conversion 
the final year of our technology access program tap agreements with eli lilly and amgen concluded in august and december  respectively 
in addition  the third and final year of our technology access program agreement with millennium which began on march  concludes in the first quarter of it is too soon for us to know whether these former tap customers will continue to purchase our products and support services at historic levels after they have fully utilized the credits created from the conversion of outstanding tap subscription fees  or whether we will be able to replace this revenue from the utilization of these credits with revenue from the sale of products to new customers 
if our former tap customers do not continue purchasing products and support services at their historic levels  or if we are not able to replace this revenue with sales to new customers  our overall revenue will be adversely affected 
we rely on agilent to manufacture  market and distribute the agilent bioanalyzer 
our revenue from the agilent bioanalyzer and labchip development funding is dependent on agilent s success and continued investment in this product line 
agilent manufactures  markets and distributes the agilent bioanalyzer under an agreement we entered into in may our ability to develop  manufacture and market these products successfully depends significantly on agilent s performance under this agreement 
sales of innovative instrumentation such as the agilent bioanalyzer involve a long sales cycle  requiring customer training and demonstration periods 
although sales of the agilent bioanalyzer increased in  we cannot predict whether this trend will continue at its current pace  if at all 
if agilent experiences manufacturing or distribution difficulties  does not actively market the agilent bioanalyzer  our future revenue from the agilent bioanalyzer may not be material 
we also anticipate research and development funding from agilent to decrease by approximately on an annualized basis beginning november  in addition  we have notified agilent of our election to terminate the agreement between the companies as of may  and agilent may terminate the agreement at their discretion at any time 
if we do not negotiate a new agreement with agilent and the collaboration terminates in may as provided under the current agreement  we could cease to receive development funding from agilent for new products 
furthermore  the revenue we receive from agilent for existing collaboration products may grow more slowly or decline 
amphora discovery corp  a related party and key customer  is a development stage company and we have no assurance of its continued purchases of our products and services 
amphora  which is independently managed and funded  has a significant on going relationship with caliper 
after amphora s december completion of a second private placement of securities with third party investors  our ownership in amphora was reduced to approximately from on a fully diluted basis 
over time we expect that our ownership in amphora will be further diluted  as we have no plans to make any future equity investments in amphora 
due to the reduction in our percentage ownership of amphora  we now have the right to appoint only one member to amphora s board 
amphora is currently caliper s largest automated drug discovery customer representing of our total revenue for as a development stage company  there can be no assurances that amphora will become commercially successful or that in the near term its business strategy will not change 
if amphora reduces its purchases of products and services or stops using caliper s drug discovery systems  we could experience a significant decline in revenues 
in connection with the completion of amphora s december financing  caliper and amphora agreed to a renegotiation of amphora s obligations under the labchip solutions agreement 
under the renegotiated agreement  the companies agreed to restructure the million minimum datapoint payment for as follows amphora agreed to purchase a minimum of million of datapoints during the second year of the agreement beginning in december and over time to make up to million of deferred payments to caliper 
these deferred payments are contingent upon amphora s future revenue generation  datapoint production and other conditions and can be satisfied by amphora under three methods i quarterly payments to caliper based on amphora s revenues  ii commissions earned by amphora as they provide certain 
table of contents marketing assistance to caliper for caliper s instruments  and iii additional datapoint payments if amphora exceeds the certain minimum datapoint levels 
we also agreed to defer to december  amphora s obligation to purchase the one remaining caliper instrument of the originally scheduled to be purchased by amphora before december  in consideration for our agreement to this restructuring  amphora issued to caliper million shares of amphora preferred stock 
we ascribed a nominal value of  to these shares as amphora is a privately held research and development company 
to the extent that agilent s sales of the agilent bioanalyzer and labchip products are reduced for any reason  including competition from us or any of our future commercial partners  the future revenue we receive from agilent would be reduced 
we receive revenue from agilent based on a formula for gross margin sharing on sales by agilent of instruments and chips developed under our collaboration agreement 
to the extent that agilent s sales of these products after our agreement terminates is reduced for any reason  including competition from us or any other commercial partner of ours  then the revenue we would realized under the terms of the agilent agreement would be reduced 
further  agilent may decide for reasons wholly independent of competition to reduce its sales efforts and or pricing for these products 
if agilent does so  our revenue may decline 
if agilent determines that we may be violating a third party patent  it may terminate sales of the agilent bioanalyzer  which will decrease our revenue 
under our collaboration agreement with agilent  agilent may elect at any time to stop developing  manufacturing or distributing any product that it reasonably determines  on the advice of counsel  poses a substantial risk of infringing a third party patent 
for example  if a third party claims that we are violating its patent  then agilent may terminate marketing and selling of the agilent bioanalyzer system  which agilent began marketing in september  which will decrease our future revenue 
our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and  if we are not successful  could also cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products 
third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us 
we may have to pay substantial damages  including treble damages  for past infringement if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe a third party s proprietary rights 
further  we may be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license  which  if available at all  may require us to pay substantial royalties 
even if these claims are without merit  defending a lawsuit takes significant time  may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns 
we are aware of third party patents that may relate to our technology or potential products 
we have also been notified that a third party has attempted to provoke an interference with one issued us patent that we have exclusively licensed to determine the priority of inventions 
any public announcements related to litigation or interference proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our stock price to decline 
in  we settled intellectual property litigation with aclara concerning one family of aclara patents 
however  aclara could assert other patent infringement claims against us in the future in alternative dispute resolution proceedings established under our settlement agreement 
we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents  which would be expensive and  if we lose  may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights  which would reduce our ability to compete in the market 
we rely on patents to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may initiate patent litigation against third parties  such as the patent infringement suit against molecular devices corporation as described under part i item legal proceedings 
these lawsuits could be expensive  take significant time  and could divert management s attention from other business concerns 
they would put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
we may also provoke these third parties to assert 
table of contents claims against us 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving and  consequently  patent positions in our industry are generally uncertain 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any of these suits or that the damages or other remedies awarded  if any  will be commercially valuable 
during the course of these suits  there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive any of these results to be negative  it could cause our stock price to decline 
the rights we rely upon to protect our intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate  which could enable third parties to use our technology and would reduce our ability to compete in the market 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products 
if they do not protect our rights  third parties could use our technology  and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property  and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach 
we also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries 
for a variety of reasons  we may decide not to file for patent  copyright or trademark protection outside of the united states 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights or design around our proprietary technologies 
for further information on our intellectual property and the difficulties in protecting it  see part i item business intellectual property 
agilent may compete with us if our collaboration terminates after may  which could reduce the potential revenue from our independent product sales 
we notified agilent in may of our election to terminate the agreement between the companies as of may under the terms of our agreement with agilent  when our agreement terminates in may  we will grant to agilent a non exclusive  royalty bearing license to our labchip technologies as then developed for agilent to develop  make and sell products in the field of the collaboration 
consequently  there is the possibility that we may experience competition from agilent after may  which would reduce our ability to sell products independently or through other commercial partners 
we have limited experience in manufacturing our products and may encounter manufacturing problems or delays  which could result in lost revenue 
although agilent manufactures the agilent bioanalyzer  we manufacture the chips used in this instrument and also currently manufacture instruments and sipper chips for our drug discovery systems 
we currently have limited manufacturing capacity for our labchip and automated drug discovery system products and experience variability in manufacturing yields for chips and automated drug discovery products 
if we fail to deliver chips and automated drug discovery products in a timely manner  our relationships with our customers could be seriously harmed  and revenue would decline 
we currently have one manufacturing location in mountain view  california 
the actual number of chips we are able to sell or use depends in part upon the manufacturing yields for these chips 
we have only recently begun to manufacture significant numbers of sipper chips and are continuing to develop our manufacturing procedures for these chips 
in order to offer sipper chips with more than four capillaries for drug discovery applications  we will need to continue to achieve consistently high yields in this process 
we have experienced difficulties in manufacturing both our chips and instruments 
we cannot assure you that manufacturing or quality problems will not arise as we attempt to scale up our production of chips or that we can scale up manufacturing in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable costs 
if we are unable to consistently manufacture sipper chips or chips for the agilent bioanalyzer on a timely basis because of these or other factors  our product sales will decline 
we 
table of contents are currently manufacturing drug discovery instruments in house and in limited volumes 
if demand for our drug discovery instruments increases significantly  we will either need to expand our in house manufacturing capabilities or outsource to other manufacturers 
our ability to scale up manufacturing may be compromised by uncertainty regarding the volume of chips for the agilent bioanalyzer that we will need to supply to agilent in the future 
when our exclusive collaboration with agilent terminates in may pursuant to the notice we have delivered to agilent  agilent will have the option to manufacture chips itself rather than continue to receive its supply of chips from caliper 
accordingly  we will face uncertainty regarding future demand for these chips from our manufacturing operations 
we are dependent on a single source supplier for our glass and if we are unable to buy this component on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver our products to customers 
we currently purchase a key component for our chips from a single source supplier located in germany 
although we keep surplus inventory in our mountain view manufacturing facility  if we are unable to replenish this component on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver our chips to our customers  which would harm our business 
we depend on our key personnel  the loss of whom would impair our ability to compete 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff 
the loss of services of any of these persons could seriously harm our product development and commercialization efforts 
in addition  research  product development and commercialization will require additional skilled personnel in areas such as chemistry and biology  software engineering and electronic engineering 
our business is located in silicon valley  california  where demand for personnel with these skills is extremely high and is likely to remain high despite the current economic climate 
as a result  competition for and retention of personnel  particularly for employees with technical expertise  is intense and the turnover rate for these people is high 
if we are unable to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  our ability to conduct and expand our business could be seriously reduced 
the inability to retain and hire qualified personnel could also hinder the planned expansion of our business 
if a natural disaster strikes our manufacturing facility we would be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and we would experience lost revenue 
we rely on a single manufacturing location to produce our chips and drug discovery systems  and have no alternative facilities 
the facility and some pieces of manufacturing equipment are difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead time 
our manufacturing facility may be affected by natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods 
earthquakes are of particular significance since the manufacturing facility is located in mountain view  california  an earthquake prone area 
in the event our existing manufacturing facility or equipment is affected by man made or natural disasters  we would be unable to manufacture products for sale  meet customer demands or sales projections 
if our manufacturing operations were curtailed or ceased  it would harm our business 
failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in lower revenue 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned operations at least through the year however  we premise this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
our inability to raise needed capital would seriously harm our business and product development efforts 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 

table of contents we currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital 
to the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
potential acquisitions may have unexpected consequences or impose additional costs on us 
our business is dependent upon growth in the market for microfluidic products and our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis 
one of the ways we may address the need to develop new products is through acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
from time to time  we may consider and evaluate potential acquisitions or business combinations  which may include a possible merger or consolidation of our business with another entity 
we may engage in discussions relating to these types of transactions in the future 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  accounting consequences  including charges for in process research and development expenses  resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  and the assumption of unforeseen liabilities of the acquired company 
we cannot assure you that future acquisitions or business combinations in which we are involved  if any  will be successful and will not adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results 
risks related to owning our common stock our stock price is extremely volatile  and you could lose a substantial portion of your investment 
our stock has been trading on the nasdaq national market only since mid december we initially offered our common stock to the public at per share 
since then our stock price has been extremely volatile and has ranged  through march   from a high of approximately per share on march  to a low of per share both on january  and february  our stock price may drop substantially following an investment in our common stock 
we expect that our stock price will remain volatile as a result of a number of factors  including announcements by analysts regarding their assessment of caliper and its prospects  announcements by our competitors of complementary or competing products and technologies  announcements of our financial results  particularly if they differ from investors expectations  and general market volatility for technology stocks 
we have been sued in the past  and are at risk of future securities class action litigation 
in the spring and summer of  class action lawsuits were filed against certain leading investment banks and over companies that did public offerings during the prior several years  including lawsuits 
table of contents against caliper and certain of its officers and directors 
see part i item legal proceedings for a description of these lawsuits 
other securities litigation could result in potential liability  cause us to incur litigation costs and divert management s attention and resources  any of which could harm our business 
in addition  announcements of future lawsuits of this or some other nature  and announcements of events occurring during the course of the current and any future lawsuits  could cause our stock price to drop 
concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers  directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 
as of december   our directors  entities affiliated with our directors  our executive officers and principal stockholders beneficially own  in the aggregate approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders as a group are able to substantially influence the management and affairs of caliper and  if acting together  would be able to influence most matters requiring the approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors  any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and any other significant corporate transaction 
the concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change of control of caliper at a premium price if these stockholders oppose it 
provisions of our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover  which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition  merger in which we are not the surviving company or changes in our management 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of the outstanding voting stock  from consummating a merger or combination including us 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have interest rate market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of our investment will probably decline 
declines of interest rates over time will reduce our interest income from our investments 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
all of these instruments are held other than for trading purposes 
the table below presents our investment portfolio by expected maturity and related weighted average interest rates at december  fair value total december  cash and money market funds fixed rate average interest rate available for sale marketable securities fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate total securities average interest rate 
table of contents our equipment sale leaseback financings  amounting to million as of december   are all at fixed rates and therefore  have minimal exposure to changes in interest rates 
we have operated primarily in the united states and substantially all sales to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
