prior year restatement of financial statements as reported in our annual report on form k  we restated our audited financial statements for the years ended april  and  our unaudited financial statements for each of the quarters in those years and unaudited financial statements for the quarters ended july   october  and january  these restatements related to shipments to three distributors made on a consignment basis during fiscal year but recorded as sales in that year  premature shipments to customers when product was shipped well in advance of the date originally specified by the customer and correction of certain accounting errors in our european subsidiary 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  certain consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
for all periods presented in this section  results of operations reflect the classification of our company owned retail store operating results and loss on disposal of these stores as discontinued retail operations 
year ended april  in thousands  except per share data consolidated statements of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses depreciation selling  general and administrative restructuring and asset impairment charges restatement expenses total operating expenses operating income loss interest income expense interest expense interest income net interest expense net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued retail operations  net of tax net income loss year ended april  compared to the year ended april  net sales during fiscal net sales decreased approximately million or to million 
the detail of net sales by strategic business unit sbu was as follows year ended april  increase decrease percent change in millions  except percent change golf corporate specialty retail international other total as mentioned in our risks section  some of the decline in sales in each sbu may be attributable to customers fears about our stability after the announcement of the need to restate earnings 
during fiscal year  net sales within our golf sbu decreased by million to million from million in the prior year 
net sales within our golf sbu continued to be negatively impacted by the economy and flat demand due to an oversupply of product in the golf marketplace and a decrease in the number of rounds played 
net sales within our corporate sbu decreased million to million from million in the prior year as corporate customers spent less on marketing programs 
during the first quarter of fiscal we launched a new corporate catalog that had a positive impact on sales in the remainder of fiscal net sales within our specialty retail sbu decreased million to million from million in the prior year 
specialty retail sales decreased as a result of the discontinuation of our dressier women s line and the difficult conditions facing independent specialty stores 
net sales within our international sbu decreased by approximately million to million from million in the prior year 
for fiscal  net sales within our international sbu included approximately million in sales generated by our european subsidiary 
this subsidiary was closed and substantially liquidated at the end of fiscal as a result  net sales for fiscal year do not include any direct european sales 
our european operations were replaced with a licensing relationship with eurostyle ltd 
eurostyle effective may  we anticipate it will take some time before this relationship gains momentum 
because we will no longer sell directly in europe  we will generate licensing revenues  instead of direct sales  on all future sales of our products in that market 
these licensing revenues are calculated as a percentage of net sales of our products by eurostyle 
the decrease in sales resulting from closing our european operations was partially offset by an increase in licensing and royalty income 
net sales within our other sbu include liquidation sales and shipping revenue and decreased million to million from million in the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to lower liquidation sales in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit in fiscal  our gross profit was of net sales  compared to in fiscal in fiscal  our gross profit was impacted by inventory write downs  lower margins on liquidation sales and higher off price discounts 
inventory write downs were recorded as part of our restructuring plan  which included closure of our european operations and exiting the dressier side of our women s line and our golf shoe business 
our gross profit may not be comparable to other entities  since some entities include all costs related to their distribution network in the cost of sales 
we have consistently included inbound freight charges in cost of sales  and included other costs of distribution in selling  general and administrative expenses 
depreciation depreciation expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal depreciation expense decreased during fiscal due to the disposal of assets used in our european operations and certain assets used at our previous corporate headquarters 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense for new capital expenditures 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in fiscal compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  and decreased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal approximately million of this decrease related to the closure of our european operations 
salaries  sales commissions and related taxes and benefits decreased by approximately million due to lower sales levels and savings resulting from our restructuring plans

marketing expenses decreased by approximately million  sample expenses decreased by approximately million  training and supply costs decreased by approximately million  travel expenses decreased by approximately million  sales meeting and tradeshow costs decreased by approximately million and business taxes decreased approximately million primarily due to internal cost cutting measures and lower sales levels 
bad debt expense decreased approximately million primarily due to increased management of credit exposures 
these decreases were partially offset by increases of approximately million in insurance expense and approximately million in legal and other professional fees 
restructuring and asset impairment we have two restructuring plans  the restructuring plan and the restructuring plan 
the restructuring plan included closing our wholly owned european subsidiary  refining our company owned retail store strategy  closing four under performing company owned retail stores  consolidating and restructuring our women s line sales force  discontinuing our golf shoe business  discontinuing the dressier side of our women s line  recording losses on subleases of excess warehouse capacity and certain management changes

costs associated with the restructuring plan and the costs associated with refining our retail strategy and closing our retail stores included in the restructuring plan are included in discontinued retail operations 
restructuring and asset impairment expenses were million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal of the million recorded in fiscal  million related to losses on subleases of our excess warehouse capacity at our distribution center and million related to additional reserves against receivable balances with both our former chief executive officer and our former president 
the million in expenses for fiscal consisted of million related to the closure of our european operations  million related to the consolidation and restructuring of our women s line sales force  million related to the write off of prepaid sample expenses for our fall specialty retail line and severance benefits  million related to the transitions of both our former chief executive officer and our former president  million related to the abandonment of excess warehouse capacity and million related to other restructuring costs 
restatement expenses we restated certain of our historical financial statements for irregularities and errors in fiscal the restatements required a thorough investigation of what occurred and a determination of the necessary corrective action 
in addition to the extensive efforts of our employees in this investigation  we utilized our regular outside legal counsel  special independent legal counsel  a forensic accounting firm  our independent auditors and other specialists for additional procedures 
as a result of the restatement  three shareholder class action lawsuits and a shareholder derivative lawsuit were filed  naming us and certain of our current and former directors and officers as defendants 
we have reached an agreement to settle these lawsuits  including our agreement to pay million in cash plus up to an additional million based on a formula applied to any recovery in our ongoing suit against genesis insurance company 
the settlement agreement is subject to final court approval 
we also expect to reach an agreement with the staff of the sec that would resolve the previously announced investigation of the company 
the anticipated agreement would remain subject to final approval by the commission 
restatement expenses amounted to approximately million for the year ended april  and included the million settlement charge  million of legal and professional fees  million of accrued retention bonuses to certain key employees and million of amortization of the premium for the replacement directors and officers liability insurance and other restatement costs 
although the restatement has been completed  we will continue to incur legal and other professional service costs in connection with the final approval of the settlement of the shareholder lawsuits and the sec investigation and the ongoing lawsuit against genesis insurance company 
these expenses cannot be estimated at this time 
in addition  there will be an ongoing charge each quarter until october for the retention bonus  which will aggregate to as much as million payable in fiscal and fiscal operating income loss as a result of the above items  operating loss decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal income taxes we recorded approximately  of income tax benefit in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the effective rates for income taxes in fiscal and were and  respectively 
this decrease in our fiscal effective rate resulted from the establishment of a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets and non deductible restructuring and asset impairment charges  and may be offset by state tax liabilities in certain jurisdictions 
loss from discontinued retail operations  net of tax during fiscal  our board of directors determined that we should focus our resources on our wholesale business and close our retail stores 
although the retail stores provided a showcase for our product lines  the operation of the stores did not provide a satisfactory financial return 
all stores were closed as of april  the fiscal loss from discontinued retail operations  net of tax  was million compared to million in fiscal the loss from discontinued retail operations in includes retail store closure expenses of million pretax million net of tax 
retail store closure costs in include both the costs associated with the restructuring plan million pretax and the costs associated with refining our retail strategy and closing our retail stores included in the restructuring plan million pretax 
the restructuring plan charge included lease termination costs  termination and severance benefits to be paid as a result of the involuntary termination of employees at our retail stores and corporate retail division  the write down of other current assets  furniture and equipment and deferred rent to net realizable value and other costs resulting from the closure of the ten additional retail stores 
the restructuring plan charge of million pretax related to additional closure costs  primarily termination of lease obligations  on the four stores identified for closure during fiscal also included in fiscal loss from discontinued retail operations is a million fee paid to hilco merchant resources  llc hilco in connection with the decision to close the retail stores 
we entered into an agreement with hilco to act as our agent for conducting the liquidation of store inventories and to assist with negotiations for termination of the store leases 
as a guaranty of hilco s performance we receive a guaranteed payment of of the aggregate retail price of the inventory being liquidated 
as compensation for its services  hilco received a base fee of up to of the retail price of the liquidation inventory plus all expenses incurred in connection with the liquidation event  including store level operating expenses 
to the extent the proceeds from the liquidation sales exceeded the sum of the guaranteed payment plus all liquidation expenses and hilco s base fee  such excess proceeds were split to us and to hilco 
as of april   the guaranteed payment totaled approximately million and hilco s fees totaled approximately million 
the million has been recorded in the discontinued retail operations results and includes hilco s base fees  reimbursable expenses incurred by hilco and certain store level operating expenses paid for by hilco under the terms of the agreement 
the loss from discontinued retail operations in includes store closure costs of million pretax million after tax under the restructuring plan

year ended april  compared to the year ended april  beginning in fiscal year  we realigned our business into strategic business units sbus golf  corporate  specialty retail  international and other 
the following discussion and analysis reflects this new sbu structure as if it had been in place for fiscal years and net sales during fiscal net sales decreased approximately million or to million 
the detail of net sales by strategic business unit sbu was as follows year ended april  increase decrease percent change in millions  except percent change golf corporate specialty retail international other total during fiscal net sales within the golf sbu decreased million to million from million in the prior year 
the decrease in net sales in this sbu was primarily due to inventory saturation in the marketplace and lower consumer demand  due in part to a decline in tourist travel to resorts and destination golf courses 
net sales within the corporate sbu decreased million to million from million in the prior year 
the decrease in net sales to this sbu was primarily due to a decline in corporate spending on marketing programs  as a result of current economic conditions 
net sales within the specialty retail sbu decreased million to million from million in the prior year 
this decrease was attributable to lower consumer spending on our products due in part to soft consumer demand for apparel 
net sales within our international sbu  which includes sales of our wholly owned european subsidiary and to distributors and licensees  decreased million to million from million in the prior year 
this decrease was due to the slowing global economy  the decline in tourist travel to resorts and destination golf courses  and our decision to close our european operations 
net sales within our other sbu  which includes shipping revenue and liquidation sales  increased million to million from million in the prior year 
the increase in net sales in this sbu was primarily due to an increase in liquidation sales 
liquidation sales increased due to the lack of acceptance of components of our golf and specialty retail collections  an increase in the number of liquidation sales as a result of our implementation of our restructuring plan and lower consumer demand for apparel 
gross profit in fiscal  our gross profit was of net sales  compared to in fiscal the decrease during fiscal was due to inventory write downs related to our restructuring plan  higher liquidation losses and higher off price discounts driven by the competitive economic environment and our efforts to reduce our inventory levels 
our gross profit may not be comparable to other entities  since some entities include all costs related to their distribution network in the cost of sales 
we have consistently included inbound freight charges in cost of sales  and included other costs of distribution in selling  general and administrative expenses 
depreciation depreciation expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to depreciation expense on new capital expenditures 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million fiscal from million in and increased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal salaries  sales commissions and related taxes and benefits decreased by approximately million due to lower sales levels and savings resulting from our restructuring plan 
approximately million of the decrease related to the closure of our european subsidiary 
sales meeting and tradeshow costs decreased by approximately million  marketing expenses decreased by approximately million and travel costs decreased by million primarily due to internal cost cutting measures and lower sales levels 
these decreases were partially offset by increases of approximately million in sample costs  approximately million in rent expense associated with increased warehouse capacity  approximately million in legal and other professional fees  approximately million in business taxes and approximately million in other general and administrative expenses 
restructuring and asset impairment restructuring and asset impairment expenses were million in fiscal these expenses consisted of million related to the closure of our european operations  million related to the consolidation and restructuring of our women s line sales force  million related to the write off of prepaid sample expenses for our fall specialty retail line and severance benefits  million related to the transitions of both our former chief executive officer and our former president  million related to the abandonment of excess warehouse capacity and million related to other restructuring costs 
costs associated with the restructuring plan  excluding costs associated with refining our retail strategy and closing our retail stores  are included in restructuring and asset impairment expenses 
costs associated with refining our retail strategy and closing our retail stores included in the restructuring plan are included in discontinued retail operations 
there were no restructuring or asset impairment expenses in fiscal operating income loss as a result of the above items  operating loss in fiscal was million compared to operating income of million in fiscal income taxes we recorded approximately million of income tax benefit in fiscal the effective rates for income taxes in fiscal and were and  respectively 
this decrease in our fiscal effective rate resulted from non deductible restructuring and asset impairment charges  and may be offset by state tax liabilities in certain jurisdictions 
loss from discontinued retail operations  net of tax the fiscal loss from discontinued retail operations  net of tax  was million compared to million in fiscal the increase related primarily to the store closure costs of million pretax million after tax under the restructuring plan 
the million charge resulted from fixed asset write downs primarily leasehold improvements and lease termination cost related to the four stores identified for closure 
in addition  the retail store gross margins in fiscal were slightly lower than fiscal and operating costs were higher 
quarterly results and seasonality historically  we have generally experienced our lowest levels of net sales in the first and third quarters ending july and january  respectively 
correspondingly  our highest level of net sales are achieved in the second and fourth quarters  ending october and april  respectively 
this seasonality is primarily attributable to the timing of shipments to golf pro shops and specialty retail stores in the second and fourth quarters 
other factors contributing to the variability of our quarterly results include seasonal fluctuations in consumer demand  the timing and amount of orders from key customers  the timing and magnitude of sales of seasonal remainder merchandise and availability of product 
this pattern of sales creates seasonal profitability and working capital financing and liquidity issues  as we generally must finance higher levels of inventory during the first and third quarters when our net sales are lowest

the restructuring and asset impairment charges were recorded as part of our and restructuring plans 
items that increased cash included a decrease in accounts receivable of million due to increased collections and decreased sales  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million that was primarily due to a million federal income refund received in fiscal and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
these items were partially offset by an increase in inventory of million 
the increase in inventory consisted primarily of an increase of approximately million related to our core merchandise  offset by a decrease of approximately million related to our specialty retail merchandise

approximately million of the decrease in inventory related to core merchandise  million related to specialty retail merchandise  million related to footwear and accessories  million related to retail stores and e commerce  million in embroidery work in process and other and million in our european operations 
the decrease in inventory in fiscal resulted from the implementation of our restructuring plan as well as our planned reduction in inventory levels to align inventories with our sales expectations 
these items were partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million and the timing of payments for certain payables 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal and was primarily due to purchases of capital equipment of approximately million  partially offset by a decrease in trademarks and patents and proceeds from fixed asset disposals and disposals related to discontinued retail operations of million

net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal this resulted from net repayments of debt of million and principal payments under capital leases of million 
these decreases were partially offset by the sale of million of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
capital expenditures of approximately million are planned for fiscal  including amounts for information technology initiatives  computer hardware  software  and furniture and office equipment 
in addition  we will be required to pay million in cash upon finalization of the settlement of the shareholder lawsuits 
we expect this payment to be made in fiscal on march   we entered into a loan agreement with wells fargo bank  n 
a wells fargo as agent and century business credit corp  an affiliate of wells fargo  as collateral agent and lender for a million line of credit that expires in march this replaced our previous line of credit with washington mutual bank that expired on march  we entered into our previous loan agreement with washington mutual bank in march  which included bank of america  na as a co lender 
effective january   we renewed and modified our loan agreement to reduce the line of credit to million and allow the co lender  bank of america na to exit the agreement 
our current loan agreement contains certain restrictive covenants covering minimum net worth  minimum working capital and maximum capital expenditures 
these financial covenants require that we maintain a tangible net worth of at least million and working capital of at least million at all times  and capital expenditures are not to exceed million in the fiscal year and million in fiscal years and we were in compliance with these covenants at april  our loan agreement with wells fargo contains no requirement for a cash collateral account 
we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from ongoing operations  as well as the ability to borrow under bank lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements in the short term and during the next fiscal year 
we also have available alternative sources of financing including factoring our accounts receivable and financing our capital expenditures with leases 
although these methods of financing are currently available to us  we do not anticipate using alternative sources of financing in the short term or during the next fiscal year 
however  our capital needs will depend on many factors  including our growth rate  the need to finance increased production and inventory levels  the success of our various sales and marketing programs  expenses associated with the risks and uncertainties related to our restatement  including those risks and uncertainties set forth above and various other factors 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of april  contractural obligations less than year years years after years total in thousands operating leases      letters of credit   capital leases   retention bonuses   restructuring liabilities    foreign currency exchange risk we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates 
in conjunction with the closing of our european operations  we have some remaining assets and liabilities denominated in euros 
these balances are not material to our consolidated financial statements 
to the extent we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are not hedged  we are subject for foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in the company s filing on form k for the year ended april  our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowances for doubtful accounts and returns we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which is included in bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing our accounts receivable aging and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering customers financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we also maintain an estimate of potential future product returns related to current period product receivables 
we analyze the rate of historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for returns  which is included with the allowance for doubtful accounts on our balance sheets 
inventories inventories  which are predominantly finished goods  are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the weighted average method 
a detailed analysis of inventory is performed on a quarterly basis to identify unsold out of season golf and specialty retail merchandise 
the net realizable value of the out of season merchandise is estimated based upon disposition plans and historical experience 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying amount of out of season merchandise to its estimated net realizable value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying values of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and changes in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
restructuring liabilities  retail store closure expenses restructuring related liabilities and retail store closure expenses include estimates for termination benefits  anticipated disposition of lease obligations and other costs 
key variables in determining such estimates include the anticipated timing of sublease rentals  estimates of sublease rental payment amounts and estimates for brokerage and other related costs 
we periodically evaluate and  if necessary  adjust our estimates based on currently available information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks  including interest rate risks associated with financial instruments included in cash and cash equivalents 
due to the short term nature of these instruments and our investment policies and procedures  we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes
