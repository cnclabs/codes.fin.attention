long term care 
the most significant portion of our business relates to long term care  including skilled nursing care and assisted living 
on december   we operated skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities in states with more than percent of our facilities located in florida  illinois  michigan  ohio and pennsylvania 
within some of our centers  we have medical specialty units which provide subacute medical and rehabilitation care and or alzheimer s care programs

facilities beds facilities beds facilities beds skilled nursing facilities additions divestitures assisted living facilities additions divestitures health care services 
our home health and hospice business includes all levels of home care  hospice care and rehabilitation therapy with offices in states 
the growth in 
table of contents our home health and hospice business is primarily a result of opening additional offices and expansion of our hospice client base in existing markets where we benefit from our long term care relationship 
we have also had some growth from acquisitions  including our acquisition of in home health  inc  or ihhi  in  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we provide rehabilitation therapy in our skilled nursing centers and our outpatient therapy clinics  as well as in hospitals and schools  serving the midwestern and mid atlantic states  texas and florida 
we provide program management services for subacute care and acute rehabilitation programs in hospitals and skilled nursing centers 
on april   we completed the sale of our mesquite  texas acute care hospital to health management associates  inc  or hma  for million in cash 
separately  we invested million to acquire percent of the hma entity owning the hospital 
the total gain on the sale of the hospital was million 
we recorded a pretax gain of million and deferred million  or percent  of the gain 
simultaneously  we acquired for million a percent interest in an hma entity that had recently acquired another hospital in mesquite  texas 
other services 
we have long term management contracts with physician practices in the midwestern states  specializing in vision care 
in  we decided that our vision management business was no longer a long term strategy  which resulted in the writedown of intangible assets and the termination of one of the contracts 
we are a majority owner of a medical transcription company that converts medical dictation into electronically formatted patient records 
health care providers use the records in connection with patient care and other administrative purposes 
medicare and medicaid payment changes under the budget act 
government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid prescribe  by law  the billing methods and amounts that may be charged and reimbursed to care for patients covered by these programs 
on august   congress enacted the balanced budget act of  or the budget act  which sought to achieve a balanced federal budget by  among other things  reducing federal spending on medicare and medicaid 
the budget act contained numerous changes affecting medicare and medicaid payments to skilled nursing facilities  home health agencies  hospices and therapy providers  among others 
medicare reimbursed skilled nursing facilities retrospectively for cost reporting periods that began before july  under this system  each facility received an interim payment during the year 
the skilled nursing facility then submitted a cost report at the end of each year  and medicare adjusted the payment to reflect actual allowable direct and indirect costs of services 
the budget act changed the medicare payment system to a prospective system in which medicare reimburses skilled nursing facilities at a daily rate for specific covered 
table of contents services  regardless of their actual cost  based on various categories of patients 
the medicare program phased in this prospective payment system over three cost reporting periods beginning on or after july  the budget act also required a prospective payment system to be established for home health services  which began october  the budget act also reduced payments to many providers and suppliers  including therapy providers and hospices  and gave states greater flexibility to administer their medicaid programs by repealing the federal requirement that payment be reasonable and adequate to cover the costs of efficiently and economically operated nursing facilities 
federal medicare payment legislation 
in november  congress passed the medicare  medicaid and schip balanced budget refinement act of  or bbra in addition  in december congress passed the medicare  medicaid  and schip benefits improvement and protection act of  or bipa both bbra and bipa redressed certain reductions in medicare reimbursement resulting from the budget act 
several provisions of bbra positively affected us  beginning primarily in the latter half of these provisions included a temporary increase in the payment for certain high cost nursing home patients  for services provided beginning april  bipa amended this provision to redistribute the amounts applicable to rehabilitation patients from three specific categories to all rehabilitation categories 
this temporary increase will continue until the secretary of the department of health and human services implements a refined patient classification to better account for medically complex patients 
the secretary did not implement such refinements in fiscal year  and president bush s proposed fiscal year budget indicates that the refinements will not be adopted in fiscal year  specific services or items  such as ambulance services in conjunction with renal dialysis  chemotherapy items and prosthetic devices  furnished on or after april   may be reimbursed outside of the prospective payment system daily rate  a two year moratorium on the annual  therapy cap on each of physical speech therapy and occupational therapy beginning with services provided on or after january  bipa amended this provision  extending the moratorium through december  while congress did not extend the moratorium before it expired  the centers for medicare medicaid services has announced that it will not begin enforcing the therapy caps until july   and a delay in the percent reduction in the base payment level for our home health business until october bipa further amended this provision  extending the delay through september  
table of contents certain of the increases in medicare reimbursement for skilled nursing facilities provided for under bbra and bipa expired on september   the so called medicare cliff 
congress has not enacted additional legislation to date to further extend these provisions 
no assurances can be given as to whether congress will increase or decrease reimbursement in the future  the timing of any action or the form of relief  if any  that may be enacted 
we believe that much of the decrease in revenues from the medicare cliff will be offset by a shift in the mix of our patients to a higher percentage of medicare and insurance  as well as the medicare statutory annual inflationary increase effective october labor 
labor costs consist of wages  temporary nursing staffing and payroll overhead  including workers compensation 
labor costs account for approximately percent of the operating expenses of our long term care segment 
our long term care wage rate increases in were approximately percent  the lowest rate of increase in over two years 
we have decreased our temporary staffing expenses but have also seen a rise in workers compensation expense 
we compete with other health care providers to attract and retain qualified or skilled personnel 
we also compete with various industries for lower wage employees 
although we currently do not face a staffing shortage in all markets where we operate  we have used high priced temporary help to supplement staffing levels in markets with shortages of health care workers  primarily in and we implemented certain training and education programs  which have helped with retention of employees 
our temporary staffing costs for our long term care segment have decreased by over percent in comparison with if a shortage of nurses or other health care workers occurred in all geographic areas in which we operate  it could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and could further increase our operating costs 
general and professional liability costs 
the significant increase in patient care liability costs in the past three years is a critical issue for our industry 
general and professional liability claims for the long term care industry have become increasingly expensive 
the long term care industry received some assistance with the passage of a measure of tort reform in florida in may that became fully effective on october  the industry had not been included in previously passed tort reform in florida that benefited other health care providers 
the legislation that was passed includes caps on punitive damages  limits to add on legal fees  tougher rules of evidence and a reduced statute of limitations 
in addition to florida  there has been increased focus on tort reform at the national level  as well as a start of reform in other key states 
while we cannot assure you that the legislative changes will have a positive impact on the current trend  we believe that this could be an important step in reducing the long term care industry s current litigation burden 

table of contents critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements  giving due regard to materiality 
receivables and revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when the related patient services are provided 
receivables and revenues are stated at amounts estimated by us to be the net realizable value 
no individual customer or group of customers accounts for a significant portion of our revenues or receivables 
certain classes of patients rely on a common source of funds to pay the cost of their care  such as the federal medicare program and various state medicaid programs 
medicare program revenues for the years prior to the implementation of the prospective payment system and certain medicaid program revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by government representatives 
we believe that any differences between the net revenues recorded and final determination will not materially affect the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on certain factors  such as payor type  historical collection trends and aging categories 
we calculate our reserve for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
the percentage that we apply to the receivable balances in the various aging categories is based on our historical experience and time limits  if any  for each particular pay source  such as private  insurance  medicare and medicaid 
impairment of property and equipment and intangible assets 
we evaluate our property and equipment and intangible assets on a quarterly basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or the life of the asset may need to be changed 
we consider internal and external factors of the individual facility or asset  including changes in the regulatory environment  changes in national health care trends  current period cash flow loss combined with a history of cash flow losses and local market developments 
if these factors and the projected undiscounted cash flow of the entity over its remaining life indicate that the asset will not be recoverable  the carrying value will be adjusted to its fair value if it is lower 
if our projections or assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for our assets 
general and professional liability 
we purchase general and professional liability insurance and have maintained an unaggregated self insured retention per occurrence ranging from million to million depending on the policy year and state 
we also have 
table of contents additional self insurance levels that could result in maximum aggregate payments of million and million for the annual policy periods ending may  and  respectively 
our general and professional reserves include amounts for patient care related claims and incurred but not reported claims 
the amount of our reserves is determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data 
the estimation process requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of the claims 
using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about emerging trends  we along with our independent actuary develop information about the size of ultimate claims based on our historical experience and other available industry information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in costs  the expected cost of claims incurred but not reported and the expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
our assumptions take into consideration our internal efforts to contain our costs by reviewing our risk management programs  our operational and clinical initiatives  and other industry changes affecting the long term care market 
we also monitor the reasonableness of the judgments made in the prior year estimation process and adjust our current year assumptions accordingly 
we evaluate the adequacy of our general and professional liability reserves with our independent actuary semi annually 
we do see an improving trend in terms of patient liability costs  and our average settlement costs per claim have decreased in comparison to the prior year 
although we believe our liability reserves are adequate  we can give you no assurance that these reserves will not require material adjustment in future periods 
workers compensation liability 
our workers compensation reserves are determined based on an estimation process that uses company specific data 
we continuously monitor the claims and develop information about the ultimate cost of the claims based on our historical experience 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in costs  the expected costs of claims incurred but not reported and the expected future costs related to existing claims 
our assumptions take into consideration our internal efforts to contain our costs with safety and training programs 
in addition  we review industry trends and changes in the regulatory environment 
although we believe our liability reserves are adequate  we can give you no assurance that these reserves will not require material adjustment in future periods 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
our revenues increased million from to excluding the results of our hospital that we sold in  revenues increased million  or percent  compared with revenues from our long term care segment increased million  or percent  primarily due to increases in rates patient mix million and capacity million 
our revenues from the home health and hospice business increased million  or percent  primarily because of an increase in hospice services 

table of contents our rate increases for the long term care segment related to medicare  medicaid and private pay sources 
our average medicare rate increased percent from per day in to per day in  primarily due to inflationary increases 
the medicare rate increase was offset by the expiration of certain rate increases from bbra and bipa on september   the so called medicare cliff 
because of the net effect of inflationary increases and the medicare cliff  our medicare rates in the fourth quarter of were reduced by per patient day to per day compared with the third quarter 
the related revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in the volume of medicare patients 
our average medicaid rate increased percent from per day in to per day in we expect our average medicaid rate to increase between percent and percent in the first half of  but we are unable to predict the rate increase  if any  for the second half 
our average private and other rates for our skilled nursing facilities increased percent from per day in to per day in the increase in overall rates was also a result of the shift in the mix of our patients to a higher percentage of medicare patients 
our bed capacity increased between and primarily because of the transfer of assisted living facilities out of held for sale  as well as the timing of opening or closing facilities see our table in the overview 
assets held for sale were not included in our long term care segment in our occupancy levels were percent for and when excluding start up facilities  our occupancy levels were percent for and our occupancy levels for skilled nursing facilities were percent for and in the third and fourth quarter of  our skilled nursing occupancy was percent 
the quality mix of revenues from medicare  private pay and insured patients related to long term care facilities and rehabilitation operations remained constant at percent for and operating expenses 
our operating expenses increased million from to excluding the results of our hospital that was sold in  operating expenses in increased million  or percent  compared with operating expenses from our long term care segment increased million  or percent 
operating expenses from our home health and hospice business increased million  or percent  because of an increase in services 
we attribute the largest portion million of the long term care operating expense increase between and to wages  temporary staffing and payroll overhead  including workers compensation 
our other operating expense increase for this segment included ancillary costs  excluding internal labor  of million 
ancillary costs  which include various types of therapies  medical supplies and prescription drugs  increased as a result of our more medically complex patients 
our long term care general and professional liability expense decreased from million in to million in our expense included million of additional expense due to a court ordered liquidation of one of our insurers 
the corresponding reserve 
table of contents represents our estimated costs for claims in to that may not be covered by government emergency recovery funds 
our expense included million for our current policy periods and million for a change in estimate on policy periods prior to june refer to our overview for additional discussion of our general and professional liability costs 
we had an additional long term care operating expense of million in the fourth quarter of related to the damage award from the arbitration decision with neighborcare pharmacy services  or neighborcare 
on february   a decision was rendered in an arbitration hearing between neighborcare  an institutional pharmacy services subsidiary of genesis health ventures  inc  and us 
the decision denied our right to terminate our neighborcare supply agreements before their expiration on september  the decision required us to pay damages and certain related amounts of approximately million to neighborcare for profits lost  as well as prejudgment interest of million  as a result of their being precluded from supplying other facilities of ours 
the estimated interest cost of million was recorded in interest expense 
during  we reversed million of the million charge that was recorded in based on an amendment to the decision and award dated june  we paid million in see discussion of the interest expense portion of the award below 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased million compared with in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge related to the restructuring of our split dollar insurance arrangements 
one of our senior executive retirement plans is funded through collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangements 
under these arrangements  the officers are owners of the life insurance policies subject to an assignment to manor care of an interest in the policy cash value equal to the premiums paid by us 
because of the possible interpretation that our future payment of premiums on these policies would be considered a prohibited loan under the sarbanes oxley act of  we suspended future premium payments following the passage of that act 
policy dividend values are currently being used to pay the required portion of the annual premiums 
in addition  under the split dollar assignment agreements  the transaction with manor care of america  inc  or mca  in required us to set aside cash for future premium payments or to reallocate a portion of the corporate interest in the policies 
as the sarbanes oxley act may prohibit additional funding by manor care  we committed to reallocate million of our interest in the policy cash surrender values to the various officer policies  upon officer retirement 
this reallocation also reduced our accrued liability by million  resulting in a net charge of million 
excluding this charge  general and administrative expenses approximated percent of revenues and increased million from the prior year 
the increases related to general inflationary costs that were partially offset by decreases in costs for deferred compensation plans and stock 
table of contents appreciation rights 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation remained constant in comparison to the prior year 
the increase in depreciation for our new construction projects and renovations of existing facilities was offset by the decline in depreciation of million from the sale of our hospital and writedown of asset values due to impairment  as discussed below 
amortization decreased million from to because we no longer amortize goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the change in accounting principle for goodwill 
asset impairment 
during our quarterly reviews of long lived assets in  management determined that certain assets were impaired by million 
the impairment consisted of million for long term care facilities  million for non strategic land parcels  million for assets held for sale and million for our vision business 
we determined that our long term care facilities  consisting of seven skilled nursing and three assisted living facilities  were impaired in based on market conditions and their history of negative cash flows 
we determined that the necessary profitability levels would not occur in the near future and the carrying value of the facilities exceeded the projected future undiscounted cash flows 
we closed three of the facilities and are currently looking at alternatives for the other seven facilities 
we may continue to operate the facilities  sell the facilities as currently operated or sell the facilities for alternative uses 
we reduced the carrying values of the facilities by million to their estimated fair values of million 
the estimated fair values were determined based on comparable sales values 
we also determined that the carrying values of land parcels exceeded their estimated fair values by million 
the fair values were based on estimated sales values under current market conditions 
during  we received offers on all of our assisted living facilities that were held for sale 
the offers  less the cost to sell  were less than our carrying values on of these facilities and required us to write down the asset values by million to their estimated fair values of million 
we sold two of the texas facilities in the fourth quarter of the remaining facilities did not have final purchase agreements at december  and  accordingly  are no longer held for sale 
because the writedown of the assets to fair value was in excess of the depreciation that we would have recorded on these facilities  we did not have to recognize a retroactive depreciation adjustment when the facilities were transferred to property and equipment 
this transfer required us to reverse million of expense previously recorded for estimated selling costs 
we decided that our vision business was no longer a long term strategy 
because of this decision  our non compete and management contracts were impaired and written down by million in the second quarter 
the fair value of the management contracts was determined based on a discounted cash flow or a multiple of projected earnings 
we terminated one of our 
table of contents vision management contracts in the third quarter  requiring a writedown of the remaining fair value of million 
interest expense 
when excluding capitalized interest and interest from the arbitration decision with neighborcare  our interest expense decreased million compared with because of lower interest rates and debt levels

as a result of the repayment  we were assigned the full rights and privileges of the lenders including security interests in alzheimer s assisted living facilities 
during  we reached a settlement with all joint venture parties and received title to the facilities 
we consolidated the results of these facilities in the third quarter of and classified them as held for sale 
during the first half of prior to our consolidation  we recorded equity losses of million related to this development joint venture 
we were a percent owner in a partnership that sold its only nursing home in june during the second quarter of  we reversed million of previously recorded losses for this partnership

income taxes 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge related to the final resolution with the internal revenue service  or irs  for corporate owned life insurance  or coli

we paid million in additional taxes in related to the coli settlement with the irs 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  that we adopted january  under this statement  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for 
table of contents impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we completed our initial impairment test in the second quarter of and determined that million of our goodwill related to our vision business was impaired

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation will significantly change current practice in the accounting for and disclosure of guarantees 
guarantees meeting the characteristics described in the interpretation are required to be initially recorded at fair value  which is different from the general current practice of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
the interpretation s initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the interpretation also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures for virtually all guarantees even if the likelihood of the guarantor s having to make payments under the guarantee is remote 
the interpretation s disclosure requirements are effective for this year s financial statements 
we included appropriate disclosures of intercompany guarantees of debt in note to the consolidated financial statements and the residual guarantee and intercompany guarantee on our corporate headquarters operating lease in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
many variable interest entities have commonly been referred to as special purpose entities or off balance sheet structures  but this interpretation applies to a larger population of entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is any legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
until now  one company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
this interpretation changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of this interpretation apply to variable interest entities created after january  and apply to existing variable interest entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  we have not determined the effect of adopting this interpretation

after consideration of usage for letters of credit  we had million remaining credit available under the five year agreement on december  
table of contents our five year credit agreement requires us to meet certain measurable financial ratio tests  to refrain from certain prohibited transactions such as certain liens  larger than permitted dividends  stock redemptions and asset sales  and to fulfill certain affirmative obligations such as paying taxes when due and maintaining properties and licenses 
we met all covenants at december  none of our debt agreements permit the lenders to determine in their sole discretion that a material adverse change has occurred and either refuse to lend additional funds or accelerate current loans 
our senior note agreement contains a clause that is triggered if we have a change of control that is immediately followed by a downgrade in debt rating by either standard poor s ratings service or moody s investors service  inc if a change of control is followed by a rating agency downgrade  we are obligated to offer to redeem the senior notes

the following table provides information about our contractual obligations at december  payments due by years after total in thousands debt excluding capital lease obligations capital lease obligations operating leases internal construction projects environmental liability total the operating lease obligation includes the annual operating lease payments on our corporate headquarters that reflect interest only on the lessor s million of underlying debt obligations as well as a residual guarantee of that amount at the lease maturity in at the maturity of the lease  we will be obligated to either purchase the building by paying the million of underlying debt or vacate the building and cover the difference  if any  between that amount and the then fair market value of the building 

table of contents we believe that our free cash flow would be sufficient to permit us to repay all of our debt as it matures 
however  we also believe that a certain amount of debt has an appropriate place in our overall capital structure and it is not our strategy to eliminate all debt financing 
because of our significant annual cash flow  we believe that we will be able to refinance the major pieces of our debt as they mature  including our bank credit facility which expires in september based on our ability to refinance significant portions of our debt as it matures  we believe that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to cover operating needs  future capital expenditure requirements and scheduled debt payments of miscellaneous small borrowing arrangements and capitalized leases 
it is likely that we will pursue growth from acquisitions  partnerships and other ventures that we would fund from excess cash from operations  credit available under a refinanced bank credit agreement and other financing arrangements that are normally available in the marketplace 
commitments and contingencies letters of credit 
we had total letters of credit of million at december   which benefit certain third party insurers and bondholders of certain industrial revenue bonds  and percent of these letters of credit related to recorded liabilities 
environmental liabilities 
one or more subsidiaries or affiliates of mca have been identified as potentially responsible parties in a variety of actions relating to waste disposal sites that allegedly are subject to remedial action under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation liability act  or cercla  and similar state laws 
cercla imposes retroactive  strict joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties for the costs of hazardous waste clean up 
the actions arise out of the alleged activities of cenco  incorporated and its subsidiary and affiliated companies 
cenco was acquired in by a wholly owned subsidiary of mca 
the actions allege that cenco transported or generated hazardous substances that came to be located at the sites in question 
environmental proceedings may involve owners and or operators of the hazardous waste site  multiple waste generators and multiple waste transportation disposal companies 
these proceedings involve efforts by governmental entities or private parties to allocate or recover site investigation and clean up costs  which costs may be substantial 
we cannot quantify with precision the potential liability exposure for currently pending environmental claims and litigation  without regard to insurance coverage  because of the inherent uncertainties of litigation and because the ultimate cost of the remedial actions for some of the waste disposal sites where mca is alleged to be a potentially responsible party has not yet been determined 
based upon our current assessment of the likely outcome of the actions  we believe that our future environmental liabilities will be approximately to million 
we have received or expect to receive insurance proceeds that will substantially offset amounts due as a result of these exposures  depending upon the ultimate liabilities 
in january  we paid an environmental obligation of million and received insurance proceeds of million
