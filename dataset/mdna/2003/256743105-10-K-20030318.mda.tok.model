they engage in the business of renting vehicles directly to retail and tour customers and providing vehicle leasing and other services to franchisees that rent to customers 
the majority of dollar s revenue is derived from renting vehicles to customers from company owned stores  while the majority of thrifty s revenue is generated from leasing vehicles and providing services to franchisees 
the company s revenues consist of vehicle rentals consists of revenue generated from renting vehicles to customers  including all related charges  through company owned stores and is recognized as earned on a daily basis under the related rental contracts with customers

interest expense  net includes interest expense  net of interest earned on restricted cash  cash and cash equivalents  relating primarily to revenue earning vehicle financing 
amortization of goodwill  which as of january   is no longer recorded in order to comply with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the company s profitability is primarily a function of the volume and pricing of rental transactions  utilization of the vehicles and the number of vehicles leased to franchisees 
significant changes in the purchase or disposal price of vehicles or interest rates can also have a significant effect on the company s profitability  depending on the ability of the company to adjust pricing and lease rates for these changes 
the company s business requires significant expenditures for vehicles and consequently  requires substantial liquidity to finance such expenditures 
as with most companies  the company must exercise judgment in estimating certain costs included in its results of operations 
the more significant items include public liability and property damage the company may self insure or retain a portion of the exposure for losses related to public liability and property damage insurance 
the company retains the services of a third party actuary to provide estimates of these exposures for losses  however  these estimates change as claims are finalized and paid 
vehicle depreciation expense the company generally purchases to of its vehicles as program vehicles for which residual values are determined by depreciation rates that are established and guaranteed by the manufacturers 
the remaining to of the company s vehicles are purchased without the benefit of a manufacturer residual value guaranty program 
for these non program vehicles  the company must estimate what the residual values of these vehicles will be at the expected time of disposal to determine monthly depreciation rates 
the company continually evaluates estimated residual values 
differences between actual residual values and those estimated by the company result in a gain or loss on disposal and are recorded as an adjustment to depreciation expense 
the average life of the non program vehicles is to months and the company has generally experienced gains on disposal 
however  recent declines in used car market prices have resulted in a corresponding decline in these gains 
bad debt expense the company provides services to its franchisees  which include vehicles provided under a fleet leasing program 
the company historically has experienced several franchisee failures each year  particularly during periods of economic recession or as a result of other factors impacting the travel or rental car industries or individual franchisees 
the company must estimate a reserve for the potential amounts owed by its franchisees that will not be collected 
this estimate includes evaluating the financial viability of the franchisee and related collateral and may change as economic or industry conditions change
