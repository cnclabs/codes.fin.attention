overview we are a leading manufacturer of circulatory support products for use by patients with congestive heart failure  or chf 
according to the american heart association  million patients in the united states suffer from chf and an additional  patients are diagnosed with this disease annually 
we were the first company to receive fda approval to commercially market a ventricular assist device  or vad  to treat patients with late stage heart failure  which comprises approximately to of the chf patient population 
our vads are used primarily by these chf patients to perform some or all of the pumping function of the heart and we currently offer the widest range of products to serve this market 
we believe that our long standing reputation for quality and innovation and our excellent relationships with leading cardiovascular surgeons worldwide position us to capture growth opportunities in the expanding congestive heart failure market 
we also develop and sell products that are used by physicians and hospitals for vascular and diagnostic applications that include vascular grafts  blood coagulation testing and skin incision devices 
we conduct business both domestically and internationally 
the merger with thermo cardiosystems the merger of thoratec with tca was completed on february  we issued new shares of our common stock to the shareholders of tca in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of tca at an exchange ratio of shares of thoratec stock for each share of tca stock 
the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition because former shareholders of tca owned a majority of our outstanding stock subsequent to the merger 
for accounting purposes  tca is deemed to have acquired thoratec and  therefore  for fiscal year all financial information presented herein represents the results of operations of tca 
our consolidated financial information presented herein includes the financial results of tca for the full fiscal year and thoratec s financial results for the post merger period from february  through december  restructuring plan in june  we approved a plan to consolidate all of our vad manufacturing operations to our manufacturing facilities and headquarters in pleasanton  california  which we called the restructuring plan 
this restructuring plan specifically provided for the reduction of approximately of our manufacturing and related workforce at our woburn and chelmsford  massachusetts facilities  both of which were acquired in the merger in february we notified the affected employees during the second quarter of both through direct personal contact and written notification 
the chelmsford facility was closed in february our heartmate family of products  which were manufactured at the woburn facility  were transitioned to the pleasanton facility 
we completed the restructuring plan in the first quarter of through december   we have recorded million of restructuring charges  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  and staff accounting bulletin sab  restructuring and impairment charges 
these charges represent estimated severance costs and stock option acceleration charges

table of contents we believe that cash and investments on hand and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we expect that our operating expenses will increase in future periods as we spend more on product manufacturing  marketing  and research and development of new product lines 
the impact of inflation on our financial position and the results of operations was not significant during any of the years presented 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed below 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
merger accounting on february   thoratec completed its merger with tca 
pursuant to the merger agreement between thoratec and tca  thoratec issued new shares of its common stock to the shareholders of tca in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of tca 
the merger was treated as a reverse acquisition because the shareholders of tca owned the majority of thoratec common stock after the merger 
tca was considered the acquiror for accounting and financial reporting purposes 
the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
due to the reverse acquisition  thoratec s assets and liabilities were recorded based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the purchase price is also allocated to intangible assets  including goodwill 
as of december   approximately million of the total purchase price of million has been allocated to goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
the amounts allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets will affect the amount of amortization expense we recognize in future periods and could result in a possible impairment expense if at some future date such assets were determined to be impaired 
as a result of the merger  million relating to ipr d was expensed in the first quarter of the write off of ipr d was related to projects that were in development  had not reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use and for which successful development was uncertain 
there have been no significant developments subsequent to the merger related to the current status of any of the ipr d projects that would result in material changes to the assumptions or resulting valuation performed at the time of the merger

revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed generally upon shipment or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales to distributors are recorded when title transfers upon shipment 
one distributor has certain limited product return rights 
a limited number of other distributors have certain rights of return upon termination of their distribution agreement 
a reserve for sales returns is recorded for these customers applying reasonable estimates of product returns based upon significant historical experience in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
no other direct sales customers or distributors have return rights or price protection 
sales of certain cardiovascular segment products to first time customers are recognized when it has been determined that the customer has the ability to use such products 
these sales frequently include the sale of products and training services under multiple element arrangements 
for most customers  training is not essential to the functionality of the products as the customers already possess sufficient expertise and experience to use the products 
in these situations  training is provided as a best practice to optimize the use and success of the products 
the amount of revenues under these arrangements allocated to training is based upon fair market value of the training  performed principally by third party providers 
the amount of revenues allocated to the cardiovascular segment products is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated first to the undelivered training element based on the fair market value  with the remainder being allocated to the cardiovascular segment products 
the amount of revenues allocated to training is recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized when the training is completed 
as of the 
table of contents end of  million of products have been delivered and recorded as product sales for customers that were determined to be able to use those products  but for which training had not yet been completed

the change in accrued warranty expense in and is summarized in the following table in thousands balance charges to balance beginning costs and end of year expenses deductions of year year ended december  year ended december  reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments owed to us for product sales 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in june  we approved a restructuring plan to consolidate all of our vad manufacturing operations to our manufacturing facilities and headquarters in pleasanton  california 
through december   we have recorded million of restructuring charges in accordance with emerging issues task force  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity and staff accounting bulletin  restructuring and impairment charges 
these charges represent estimated employee severance costs and stock option acceleration charges 
we completed the relocation of the woburn  massachusetts manufacturing operations to our pleasanton facility in the first quarter of and in february the fda inspected the pleasanton facility related to this transfer 
we expect to receive fda approval in the half quarter of we do not believe there are likely to be any developments until fda approval which would have a significant impact on our original restructuring cost estimates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term and long term investments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
however  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our investment portfolio at the end of consisted of short term and long term corporate bonds that are classified as available for sale and have maturities of two years or less 
the fair market value of these investments will fall if market interest rates increase
