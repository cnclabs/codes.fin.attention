if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if that happens  the trading prices of our common stock and any other securities we may issue in the future could decline significantly 

table of contents the risk factors below contain forward looking statements regarding choicepoint 
actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
see cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements on page  following the table of contents 
customers we have few long term agreements with our customers 
although our management believes that the quality of our products and services should permit us to maintain relationships with our customers  there can be no assurance that we will do so 
any loss of a significant number of our major customers would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our customers include federal  state  and local governments 
government business is subject to many unique risks  such as delays in funding  reduction or modification of contracts or subcontracts  failure to exercise options  changes in government policies  and the imposition of budgetary restraints 
a loss of government contract revenues also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the acquisition or consolidation of our customers by another company could decrease the demand for our products and services 
after consolidation  these companies may reorganize management responsibilities or strategic and purchasing decisions that could adversely affect demand for our products and services 
we may lose business relationships with key contacts within a customer s organization due to budget cuts  layoffs  or other changes resulting from an acquisition or consolidation 
the consolidation of companies also may alter the technological infrastructure of the combined entity  and our products and services may not be compatible with the new technological system 
acquisitions our long term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions 
while we believe we have been successful in implementing this strategy during prior years  we are not certain that we will complete future acquisitions on acceptable terms or that we will successfully integrate any acquired assets  data or businesses into our operations 
any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses 
such risks include  among other things paying more than fair market value for an acquired company or assets  failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses in an efficient  timely manner  assuming potential liabilities arising from the products of an acquired company  managing the potential disruption to our ongoing business  distracting management focus from our core business  impairing relationships with employees  customers  and strategic partners  incurring expenses associated with the amortization of other intangibles  incurring expenses associated with a write off of a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions  weak economies in certain competitive markets  or the failure of certain acquisitions to realize expected benefits  or diluting the share value and voting power of existing shareholders 

table of contents suppliers we depend upon third party information suppliers for information used in our databases 
the loss of some of our data supply sources could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and non proprietary databases  and our operations depend upon information derived from a wide variety of automated and manual sources 
we obtain data from public records  information companies  governmental authorities  competitors  and customers 
our agreements with our data suppliers are generally short term agreements 
some of our suppliers are also our competitors  which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements 
we have no reason to anticipate the termination of any significant relationships with these data suppliers and believe that in most cases substitute suppliers could be arranged if any termination occurred 
however  such a termination could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources 
we currently maintain databases that contain information provided and used by insurance underwriters 
we do not own the information in these databases  and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases 
if this information was withheld  our business  financial condition  and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
we use social security numbers to generate certain reports 
social security numbers could become unavailable to us in the future because of changes in the law or because data suppliers decide not to supply them to us 
if we cannot obtain this information in the future  we will be unable to generate reports as efficiently 
although we use names  addresses  and dates of birth to generate our reports  without the use of social security numbers  we believe that those reports would not be as complete or as accurate as the reports generated with social security numbers 
we also would incur significant expense to revise the software we use to generate reports 
less complete or less accurate reports could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we obtain the credit header data in our databases from consumer credit reporting agencies 
the data consists of names  addresses  social security numbers  and dates of birth 
any of these suppliers could stop supplying this data to us or could substantially increase their prices 
withholding this data could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
competition the information industry in which we operate is highly competitive  and we expect it to remain highly competitive 
in each of our markets  we compete on the basis of price  quality  customer service  product and service selection 
our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of our competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment 
due to their size  certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can 
as a result  they may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences  emerging technologies and market trends 
in addition  new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away from us 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain or strengthen our competitive position in our market segments  especially against larger competitors 
if we fail to successfully compete  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
government regulation and adverse publicity because we use personal and public record information to search our databases and access the databases of others  we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning these uses 
we provide many types of data and services which already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act  gramm leach bliley act  drivers privacy protection act  and to a lesser extent  various other federal  state  and local laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace 
however  many consumer advocates  privacy advocates  and government regulators believe the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy 
they have become increasingly concerned with the use of 
table of contents personal information  particularly social security numbers  motor vehicle reports  and dates of birth 
as a result  they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information 
the following legal and regulatory developments could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations amendment  enactment  or interpretation of laws and regulations which restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the supply of data available to our customers  changes in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection and sharing  failure of our products and services to comply with current laws and regulations  and failure of our products and services to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient  cost effective manner 
attracting and retaining qualified personnel we cannot be certain that we can continue to attract and retain sufficient qualified management  technical  sales  or other personnel necessary to conduct our business successfully 
the resignation  retirement  death or disability of our chief executive officer or chief operating officer and the inability to sufficiently replace either position could adversely affect our business 
system interruptions system interruptions could delay and disrupt our products and services  cause harm to our business and reputation  and result in a loss of customers 
we depend heavily upon our computer systems  most of which are located in alpharetta  georgia and boca raton  florida  to provide reliable  uninterrupted service 
certain events beyond our control  such as fires  floods  earthquakes  hurricanes  power losses  and telecommunications failures  could damage our computer networks and temporarily or permanently interrupt services to our customers 
our systems in boca raton  florida are particularly susceptible to hurricanes 
these interruptions also may interfere with our suppliers ability to provide data and our employees ability to attend work and perform their responsibilities 
we have attempted to shield our systems from interruptions and failures  and we carry property and business interruption insurance in case these events occur 
however  our system safeguards and our insurance still may not adequately protect us from losses arising from system interruptions 
security breaches security breaches in our facilities  computer networks  and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers 
we have instituted many security measures to protect our systems and to assure the marketplace that our systems are secure 
however  despite such security measures  our systems may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  attacks by hackers  or similar disruptive problems 
third party contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information 
if unauthorized users gain access to our databases  they may be able to steal  publish  delete or modify confidential third party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks 
a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways deterring customers from using our products and services  harming our reputation  exposing us to liability  increasing our operating expenses to correct problems caused by the breach  
table of contents affecting our ability to meet our customers expectations  or causing inquiry from governmental authorities 
economy the current general economic downturn could continue to result in a reduced demand for our products and services 
our revenues are dependent to a certain extent upon general economic conditions and upon conditions in the industries we serve 
certain of our revenues are derived from pre employment screening services 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our existing and new products 
a softening of demand for our information services caused by a weakening of the economy generally may result in decreased revenues or lower growth rates 
we cannot be certain that our future revenues  results of operations  cash flows and profitability will not fluctuate on a quarterly or annual basis or that we will be able to refinance our existing credit facility or receivables facility 
direct marketing our direct marketing products and services could be vulnerable to the following risks development of other methods of sales and advertising that are more effective than direct marketing  changes in laws and regulations relating to data privacy  in particular  email privacy  and increases in postal rates or disruption in the availability of postal services that could increase the cost of direct mail production and processing and reduce demand for information among our direct mail customers  and loss of use or data by third parties 
new products  services  and technologies our growth partially depends on our ability to develop and market new products  services and technologies 
we have focused on developing growth opportunities in a number of potential markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing new products  services and technologies or that they will gain market acceptance or generate significant revenue 
our initiatives are in various stages of development and may be subject to delays in implementation  customer dissatisfaction with product or service performance or other significant undetected problems 
if we fail to successfully introduce new initiatives  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected
