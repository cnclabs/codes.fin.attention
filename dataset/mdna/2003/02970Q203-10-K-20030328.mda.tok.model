item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview asr is a full service real estate corporation which owns  manages and operates various income producing properties 
substantially all of the company s assets are held through the operating partnership  in which the company  as of december   held a general partner interest and an limited partnership interest 
as of december   through the operating partnership  the company owned and operated properties which consisted of office  office warehouse  three shopping center  and three apartment properties  and one developmental land property 
the properties are located in four geographic regions in nine states 
the company plans to expand its business and net assets by acquiring additional properties 
the company will focus primarily on office and office warehouse properties located in texas  california and arizona 
in october  the company acquired various properties in the consolidation 
pursuant to the consolidation  subsidiaries of the company merged with eight public limited partnerships  acquired the assets and liabilities of two private entities managed by cgs and acquired certain assets and liabilities of cgs and the majority owned affiliates of cgs 
sppi  one of the eight public limited partnerships  was treated  for accounting purposes  as the acquirer of the properties in the consolidation 
pursuant to the consolidation  partners of the public partnerships received shares in the company or promissory notes in exchange for their partnership units and owners of existing related entities exchanged ownership interests in real estate for asr shares or units in the operating partnership  an entity formed for this purpose and initially wholly owned by the company 
the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data in item and the consolidated financial statements of the company  including the notes thereto  included in item the major accounting policies followed by the company are listed in note summary of significant accounting policies 
in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the results of operations during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements certain leases provide for tenant occupancy during periods for which no rent is due or where minimum rent payments increase during the term of the lease 
the company records rental income for the full term of each lease on a straight line basis 
accordingly  a receivable is recorded from tenants equal to the excess of the amount that would have been collected on a straight line basis over the amount collected and currently due deferred rent receivable 
when a property is acquired  the term of existing leases is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for purposes of this calculation 
rental properties are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  unless circumstances indicate that cost  net of accumulated depreciation  cannot be recovered  in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value 
estimated fair value i is based upon the company s plans for the continued operation of each property and ii is computed using estimated sales price  as determined by prevailing market values for comparable properties and or the use of capitalization rates multiplied by annualized net operating income based upon the age  construction and use of the building 
the fulfillment of the company s plans related to each of its properties is dependent upon  among other things  the presence of economic conditions which will enable the company to continue to hold and operate the properties prior to their eventual sale 
due to uncertainties inherent in the valuation process and in the economy  the actual results of operating and disposing of the company s properties could be materially different than current expectations 
management is reconsidering whether it is in the best interest of the company to elect to be treated as a real estate investment trust or reit  as defined under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
in the event such election is made  the election could be effective as early as january  upon the filing of the appropriate forms for the tax year 
in this regard  the company plans to operate within the requirements of reit status in in general  a reit is a company that owns or provides financing for real estate and pays annual distributions to investors of at least of its taxable income 
a reit typically is not subject to federal income taxation on its net income  provided applicable income tax requirements are satisfied 
for the tax year  the company was taxed as a c corporation 
results of operations the statement of operations for the year ended reflects the operating results of sppi for the full year  and the acquired entities for october   through december   stub period 
the statements of operations for the year ended december  solely reflect the operating results of sppi sppi wholly owned one property valencia and held an equity interest in another entity prior to the consolidation 
therefore  a comparison of operating results between and and between and is not meaningful 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the operating results of three properties are reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented 
these consist of a shopping center and an apartment property sold in and an office warehouse property expected to be sold in the second quarter of the office warehouse property was wholly owned by sppi prior to the consolidation 
see note discontinued operations of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion reflects the results from continuing operations  which include the real estate assets held for investment 
the operating results of any properties acquired during the period include operations from the date of acquisition 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the company recorded rental revenue of  and expenses of  for the year ended december  compared to rental revenue of  and expenses of  for the stub period ended december  the company acquired three office properties and sold two shopping centers and one apartment property during rental revenue of  and expenses of  were attributable to the three property acquisitions 
the weighted average occupancy of the company s properties held for investment decreased from at december  to at december  as of december   the company owned and operated properties 
during  the company recorded impairment charges of  to provide for a decrease in the estimated fair market value of five properties 
impairment charges totaling  were recorded on the company s three shopping center properties in south carolina

no impairment charges were recorded in during  the company accrued a litigation settlement expense of  associated with the settlement of the teachout matter 
as part of the settlement  which is expected to be documented in the second quarter of  the company has agreed to pay legal fees of  to plaintiff s counsel 
under the settlement  the company reaffirmed its previously announced obligation to pay the former limited partners of fund ii  or their assignees or transferees  the loans which were made and called by the former general partner of fund ii as part of the consolidation 
pursuant to the settlement  the company has established a definitive repayment plan and will secure the repayment obligation with a second deed of trust on an office building owned by the company 
the repayment plan consists of a promissory note in the amount of  the amount of such loans  plus interest as of december   which shall accrue interest only at per annum 
interest only payments will be made quarterly until the note is paid 
the note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty 
the company recorded a  net loss on sales of real estate assets during the company recorded a  loss attributable to the sale of beach lampson  a shopping center property sold in april this loss was partially offset by the recognition of a  deferred gain associated with the sale of the tower industrial property in and a  gain as a result of compensation for a strip of land condemned for highway purposes at one of its office properties 
no gain or losses on sales of real estate assets were recorded during the company recorded a  net loss on early extinguishments of debt in connection with the refinancing of several loans during losses of  due to the write off of deferred loan costs and prepayment penalties were partially offset by a  gain on the write off of an unamortized loan premium 
during  the company recognized a net gain on early extinguishments of debt of  related to the payoff of two loans and the refinancing of two other loans 
the share of loss for the year ended december  for the holders of op units was  compared to a loss of  for the stub period ended december  the loss represents the limited partner interest in the operating partnership not held by the company at december  and sppi recorded income of  from investment in its unconsolidated joint venture partner  smmp  during this represents sppi s share of income generated by smmp and smmp s joint venture partners 
the company had no investments in unconsolidated joint ventures during during  the company recognized an income tax benefit of  in  management reevaluated an earlier decision and determined that it may sell certain of the company s real estate assets outside of tax deferred exchanges 
if the company elects reit status  during the year period following such election  the company will be subject to an entity level tax on the income it recognizes upon the sale of assets contributed by certain partnerships that it held before electing reit status in an amount up to the amount of the built in gains at the time the company becomes a reit 
the potential tax related to this built in gain for book purposes is approximately  therefore  the company recognized a deferred tax liability for this potential tax and has recorded this liability as a charge to equity 
during  the deferred tax liability for the built in gains was reduced primarily due to tax effect of impairments recorded for certain real estate assets held 
in addition  based on the current strategic plans of the company  management has determined that it was more likely than not that future taxable income  primarily from the gain on the sale of real estate assets  would be sufficient to enable the company to realize all of its deferred tax assets 
therefore  as of december   no valuation allowance has been recorded and the valuation allowance previously recorded has been reversed 
the tax effect of the impairments recorded and the reversal of the previously recorded allowance along with the tax benefits of the current year tax assets have been recorded in the statement of operations as an income tax benefit

thereafter  the lender notified the company it was in default for failure to pay a matured portion of the loan  which matured in november as of december   the amount due under the matured portion of the loan was  and the aggregate principal balance of the loan agreement was  in early  the lender sold the loan to the major tenant in the shopping center 
the new lender has not accelerated the loan agreement 
the company is considering various alternatives  including selling the property or using proceeds from the sale of another property to provide capital to pay off the matured portion of the loan 
the company continues to discuss the non compliance matter with the new lender 
in october  the company received proceeds of  from two bridge loans on maple tree  one of its shopping center properties 
one of the loans  which totaled  was provided by an affiliate of a related party see item certain relationships and related party transactions 
the mortgages were repaid in conjunction with the sale of the property in october the additional proceeds from the sale of the property were held in escrow at december  in order to meet the requirements for a tax deferred exchange 
in december  the company received proceeds of  from a loan on valencia  an office warehouse property classified as real estate held for sale in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the loan was provided by an affiliate of a related party see item 
the mortgage will be repaid in conjunction with the sale of the property  which is expected to occur in the second quarter of in december  modification agreements were entered into with a bank to extend maturity on five secured loans to december  these loans  whose balances total  bear interest at libor plus through june  and  provided certain lender conditions are satisfied  libor plus thereafter 
during  the company received a  payoff on its  mortgage loan receivable 
these funds were used to meet obligations for capital costs relating to re leasing and improvements to properties 
the company recorded a  loss on sale of real estate asset related to the payoff 
in april  the board of directors declared a dividend of cents per share to each holder of common stock and op units as of april  the dividend  which totaled approximately  was paid on june  in august  the board of directors declared a dividend of cents per share to each holder of common stock and op units as of september  the dividend  which totaled approximately  was paid on october  in november  the board of directors declared a dividend of cents per share to each holder of common stock and op unit as of december  the dividend  which totaled approximately  was paid on december  the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements for normal property operating expenses and general and administrative payroll expenses from cash generated by operations 
in addition  the company anticipates selling assets to provide funds for payments of certain payables  consisting primarily of property taxes  tenant improvements and capital improvements on properties and fees for professional services 
also  the company is projecting the need for cash to fund obligations in  including capital costs incurred and to be incurred related to re leasing space and improvements to properties and litigation settlement costs 
the funds to meet these obligations will be obtained from proceeds of the sale of assets and lender held funds 
based on current analysis  the company believes that the cash generated by these anticipated sales will be adequate to meet these obligations 
there can be no assurance  however  that the sales of these assets will occur and that substantial cash will be generated 
if these sales do not occur  the company will not have sufficient cash to meet its obligations 
as of this date  the company has not paid the property taxes due on several properties 
this non payment could be considered a technical default on the loans for these properties 
the company plans to pay these taxes with the proceeds from the sale of a property which is currently expected to occur in the second quarter of there can be no assurance  however  the sale of a property will occur 
contractual obligations and commitments the company has contractual obligations with regards to future principal payments of debt  a litigation settlement  operating leases  employment agreements  and the purchase of op units from nooney development partners 
the following table aggregates the company s expected contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  dollars in thousands thereafter total long term debt debt to former limited partners litigation settlement employee obligations operating lease commitments purchase of op units from nooney development partners total funds from operations in october  the board of governors of nareit issued white paper on ffo october to clarify its definition of funds from operations ffo 
the clarification was effective january  and requires restatement for all periods presented in financial statements or tables 
ffo  as clarified by nareit  represents net income excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
in  nareit clarified that ffo related to assets held for sale  sold or otherwise transferred and included in results of discontinued operations should continue to be included in ffo 
this clarification was effective january  and requires restatement for all periods presented in financial statements or tables 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  ffo provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flows from operations  as defined by gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not necessarily indicate that cash flows will be sufficient to fund all of the company s cash needs  including principal amortization  capital improvements and distributions to stockholders 
further  ffo as disclosed by other companies may not be comparable to the company s calculation of ffo 
the following table sets forth the company s calculation of ffo for the year ended december  in thousands except weighted average shares and per share amounts 
ffo for the year ended december  is not presented as it is not comparable or meaningful 
loss from operations before minority interest and discontinued operations depreciation and amortization impairment of real estate assets income tax benefit net loss on sales of real estate assets net income from discontinued operations  excluding gain on sales depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations minority interest on partially owned property from discontinued operations ffo basic weighted average shares ffo per share inflation substantially all of the leases at the industrial and retail properties provide for pass through to tenants of certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  common area maintenance expenses  and insurance 
leases at the multifamily properties generally provide for an initial term of one month to one year and allow for rent adjustments at the time of renewal 
leases at the office properties typically provide for rent adjustment and pass through of increases in operating expenses during the term of the lease 
all of these provisions may permit the company to increase rental rates or other charges to tenants in response to rising prices and therefore  serve to reduce the company s exposure to the adverse effects of inflation 
forward looking statements this report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities and exchange act of these forward looking statements are based on management s beliefs and expectations  which may not be correct 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements include the following the company s level of indebtedness and ability to refinance its debt  the fact that the company s predecessors have had a history of losses in the past  unforeseen liabilities which could arise as a result of the prior operations of companies or properties acquired in the consolidation  risks inherent in the company s acquisition and development of properties in the future  including risks associated with the company s strategy of investing in under valued assets  general economic  business and market conditions  including the impact of the current economic downturn  changes in federal and local laws and regulations  increased competitive pressures  and other factors  including the factors set forth below  as well as factors set forth elsewhere in this report on form k 
risk factors the company s increased leverage increases its risk of default 
this could adversely affect the company s results of operations  ability to make distributions and market price of its common stock 
the company increased its indebtedness to of the estimated fair market value of its assets 
this increase in the company s leverage increases the company s risk of default on its obligations and adversely affects the company s funds from operations and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders 
the company has a higher ratio of indebtedness to assets than many reits 
this could adversely affect the market price for the company s common stock 
there are risks inherent in the company s acquisition and development strategy 
the company may not make profitable investments 
the company plans to pursue its growth strategy through the acquisition and development of additional properties 
to the extent that the company pursues this growth strategy  it does not know that it will succeed 
the company may have difficulty finding new properties  negotiating with new or existing tenants or securing acceptable financing 
in addition  investing in additional properties is subject to many risks 
for instance  if an additional property is in a market in which the company does not invest  the company will have relatively little experience in and may be unfamiliar with that new market 
also  the company s acquisition strategy of investing in under valued assets subjects the company to increased risks 
the company may not succeed in turning around these properties 
the company may not make a profit on these investments 
the company has a history of losses 
the company cannot assure the stockholders that it will become profitable in the future 
the company has incurred losses in and losses on a pro forma basis in and the company cannot assure the stockholders that it will not continue to have losses after depreciation and amortization under generally accepted accounting principles 
if the company is not successful  it will reduce or eliminate the distributions that stockholders receive from the company 
the company is responsible for liabilities of entities included in the consolidation 
this could require the company to make additional payments and reduce its available cash 
subsidiaries of the company merged with cgs s majority owned affiliates and the operating partnership and its subsidiaries acquired assets of cgs and some of its subsidiaries 
some of these companies were engaged in the business of serving as general partners of limited partnerships and investing in and managing real properties 
as a result of the consolidation  the company or its subsidiaries may be responsible for liabilities arising out of the prior operations of these entities 
these liabilities may include claims asserted in connection with pending litigations against the company and unknown contingent liabilities 
as a result  the company has expended cash and may expend additional cash to pay these liabilities 
any payments would reduce cash available for distribution to stockholders 
the company will need to refinance mortgage loans and sell properties to meet its obligations 
the company expects to require substantial cash to meet its operating requirements  including budgeted capital expenditures 
to meet these obligations  the company will be required to refinance mortgage indebtedness and or sell certain assets to provide cash 
the company cannot provide assurance that it will be successful in refinancing the mortgage indebtedness and that it will have sufficient cash to meet its obligations 
in addition to fulfill the company s growth strategy  the company may be required it to raise additional cash through debt or equity financing 
the company s properties may not be profitable  may not result in distributions and or may depreciate 
properties acquired by the company i may not operate at a profit  ii may not perform to the company s expectations  iii may not appreciate in value  iv may depreciate in value  v may not ever be sold at a profit  and or vi may not result in dividends 
the marketability and value of any properties will depend upon many factors beyond the company s control 
the company may not be able to enter into favorable leases upon the expiration of current leases and on current vacant space 
over the next three years  approximately of the square footage of the company s total rentable square footage of office warehouse  office and shopping center properties will expire 
in addition  of the company s total rentable square footage was vacant as of december  the company may be unable to enter into leases for all or a portion of this space 
if the company enters into leases  the company may not do so at comparable lease rates  without incurring additional expenses 
if the company is unsuccessful in leasing the space  or cannot re lease the space at current rental rates or higher rental rates  it could reduce the distributions to shareholders and adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
real property investments entail risk 
these risks could adversely affect the company s distributions 
the company is subject to the risks of investing in real property 
in general  a downturn in the national or local economy  changes in the zoning or tax laws or the availability of financing could affect the performance and value of the properties 
also  because real estate is relatively illiquid  the company may not be able to respond promptly to adverse economic or other conditions by varying its real estate holdings 
the company may invest in joint ventures  which adds another layer of risk to its business 
the company may acquire properties through joint ventures  which could subject the company to certain risks that may not otherwise be present if investments were made directly by the company 
these risks include i the potential that the company s joint venture partner may not perform  ii the joint venture partner may have economic or business interests or goals which are inconsistent with or adverse to those of the company  iii the joint venture partner may take actions contrary to the requests or instructions of the company or contrary to the company s objectives or policies  and iv the joint venturers may not be able to agree on matters relating to the property they jointly own 
the company also may participate with other investors  including possibly investment programs or other entities affiliated with management  in investments as tenants in common or in some other joint ownership or venture 
the risks of such joint ownership may be similar to those mentioned above for joint ventures and  in the case of a tenancy in common  each co tenant normally has the right  if an unresolvable dispute arises  to seek partition of the property  which partition might decrease the value of each portion of the divided property 
the company could incur unforeseen environmental liabilities 
various federal  state and local laws and regulations subject property owners and operators to liability for reporting  investigating  remediating  and monitoring regulated hazardous substances released on or from a property 
these laws and regulations often impose strict liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or actually caused  the release 
the presence of  or the failure to properly report  investigate  remediate  or monitor hazardous substances could adversely affect the financial condition of the company or the ability of the company to operate the properties 
in addition  these factors could hinder the company s ability to borrow against the properties 
the presence of hazardous substances on a property also could result in personal injury or similar claims by private plaintiffs 
in addition  there are federal  state and local laws and regulations which impose requirements on the storage  use  management and disposal of regulated hazardous materials or substances 
the failure to comply with those requirements could result in the imposition of liability  including penalties or fines  on the owner or operator of the properties 
future laws or regulations could also impose unanticipated material environmental liabilities on the company in connection with any of the properties 
the costs of complying with these environmental laws and regulations for the company s properties could adversely affect the company s operating costs and  if contamination is present  the value of those properties 
the company faces intense competition in all of its markets 
numerous properties compete with the company s properties in attracting tenants to lease space 
additional properties may be built in the markets in which the company s properties are located 
the number and quality of competitive properties in a particular area will have a material effect on the company s ability to lease space at existing properties or at newly acquired properties and on the rents charged 
some of these competing properties may be newer or better located than the company s properties 
there are a significant number of buyers of properties  including institutional investors and publicly traded reits 
many of these competitors have significantly greater financial resources and experience than the company 
this has resulted in increased competition in acquiring attractive properties 
this competition can adversely affect the company s ability to acquire properties and increase its distributions 
the company may never elect reit status 
the company is not required to make a reit election and the board of directors may determine not to make a reit election 
the company will be taxed as a c corporation if the board of directors of the company determines not to make a reit election  or for any time period before an effective reit election 
if the company is taxed as a c corporation  it will be subject to a corporate income tax 
the stockholders will also have to pay taxes on any distributions they receive 
if the company qualifies as a reit  it will cease to be taxed as a c corporation 
if the company fails to qualify as a reit for tax purposes or does not make a reit election  the company will pay federal income taxes at corporate rates 
if the company fails to qualify as a reit  the company will pay federal income taxes at corporate rates 
the company s qualification as a reit depends on meeting the requirements of code and regulations applicable to reits 
the company has not requested  and does not plan to request  a ruling from the internal revenue service that it qualifies as a reit 
a reit is subject to an entity level tax for a ten year period on the sale of property with a fair market value in excess of basis it held before electing reit status 
if the company elects reit status  during the year period following such election  the company will be subject to an entity level tax on the income it recognizes upon the sale of assets including all the assets transferred to it as part of the consolidation it held before electing reit status in an amount up to the amount of the built in gains at the time the company becomes a reit 
if the company fails to qualify as a reit  it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
in addition to these taxes  the company may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and various state income taxes 
if the company qualifies as a reit and its status as a reit is subsequently terminated or revoked  unless specific statutory provisions entitle the company to relief  it could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which it was disqualified 
therefore  if the company fails to qualify as a reit or loses its reit status  the funds available for distributions would be reduced substantially for each of the years involved 
in addition  dividend distributions that the company makes would generally be taxed at income tax rates on ordinary income 
to qualify as a reit  the company must meet asset requirements 
if the company fails to meet these asset requirements  it will pay tax as a corporation 
in order to qualify as a reit  at least of the value of the company s assets must consist of investments in real estate  investments in other reits  cash and cash equivalents and government securities 
in addition  the company may not have more than of the value of its assets represented by securities other than government securities and not more than of the value of its total assets represented by the securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
additionally  with the exception of securities held in a taxable reit subsidiary  the company may not own i securities in any one company other than a reit which have  in the aggregate  a value in excess of of the value of the company s total assets  ii securities possessing more than of the total voting power of the outstanding securities of any one issuer and iii securities having a value of more than of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer 
the and tests are determined at the end of each calendar quarter 
if at the end of any calendar quarter plus a day cure period  the company fails to satisfy either test  it will cease to qualify as a reit 
to qualify as a reit  the company must meet distribution requirements 
if it fails to do so  it will pay tax as a corporation 
subject to adjustments that are unique to reits  a reit generally must distribute of its taxable income 
in the event that the company does not have sufficient cash  this distribution requirement may limit the company s ability to acquire additional properties 
also  for the purposes of determining taxable income  the code may require the company to include rent and other items not yet received and exclude payments attributable to expenses that are deductible in a different taxable year 
as a result  the company could have taxable income in excess of cash available for distribution 
in that case  the company may have to borrow funds or liquidate some of its assets in order to make sufficient distributions and maintain its status as a reit or obtain approval from its stockholders in order to make a consent dividend 
the company must meet limitations on share ownership to qualify as a reit 
these limitations may deter parties from purchasing the company shares 
in order to protect its reit status  the articles of incorporation include limitations on the ownership by any single stockholder of any class of the company capital stock 
the amended and restated articles of incorporation also prohibit anyone from buying shares if the purchase would cause the company to lose its reit status 
these restrictions may discourage a change in control of the company  deter any attractive tender offers for the company shares or limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for the company shares 
future changes in tax law could adversely impact the company s qualification as a reit 
the company s treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes is based on the tax laws currently in effect 
the company is unable to predict any future changes in the tax laws that would adversely affect its status as a reit 
in the event that there is a change in the tax laws that prevents the company from qualifying as a reit or that requires reits to pay corporate level federal income taxes  the company may not be able to make the same level of distributions to its stockholders 
in addition  such change may limit the company s ability to invest in additional properties
