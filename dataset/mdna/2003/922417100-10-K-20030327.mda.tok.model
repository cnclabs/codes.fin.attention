the decrease in us process equipment sales is offset slightly by a million increase in the sale of molecular beam epitaxy mbe equipment to the telecommunications and research industries by the company s applied epi subsidiary  which was acquired in september  in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
us metrology sales decreased by million from  primarily as a result of a million decline in the sale of afms to semiconductor customers  as well as a million decrease in the sale of slc products to data storage customers 
european sales decreased by million when compared to the prior year  which is primarily attributable to a million drop in process equipment sales consisting principally of a decrease in sales of etch and deposition products to data storage customers 
metrology sales in europe decreased by  or million 
although european sales of afms decreased by million  this was offset in part by a million increase in the sale of optical interferometry products to the semiconductor and optical telecommunications industries 
sales in japan decreased by million from the decrease is principally a result of a million decline in process equipment sales 
sales to data storage customers dropped by million  while sales to the telecommunications industry declined by million 
this was partially offset by a million increase in mbe sales to telecommunications and research customers 
metrology sales in japan decreased by million  primarily as a result of a million decrease in afm sales  as well as a million decrease in optical metrology sales  particularly to semiconductor and telecommunications customers 
sales in asia pacific increased by million over the comparable period  principally as a result of a million increase in the sale of etch and deposition products to data storage customers  offset in part by a million decrease in sales of ion beam deposition products to telecommunications customers 
metrology sales in asia pacific also increased by million over  due to a million increase in sales of optical metrology products to data storage customers  as well as a million increase in sales of optical interferometry products to semiconductor and telecommunications customers  offset by a million decrease in sales of afms  principally to the semiconductor industry 
the company believes that there will continue to be quarter to quarter variations in the geographic concentration of sales 
process equipment sales in were severely affected by the downturn in the data storage and telecommunications industries  causing a decrease of million from prior year sales of million 
this was due to a million drop in etch and deposition product sales  principally to the data storage market  as well as a million decrease in optical filter deposition sales to the telecommunications industry 
mbe sales  primarily to research and wireless telecommunications customers were million during the year ended december   compared to million in metrology sales were also affected  primarily by the downturn in the semiconductor industry causing a decrease of million from million in the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to a million decrease in the sale of afms  primarily to the semiconductor and research industrial industries  as well as a million decrease in optical interferometry sales  predominantly to the data storage and semiconductor industries 
the decrease in metrology sales was partially offset by a million increase in the sale of optical metrology products 
veeco received million of orders for the year ended december   representing a decrease from million of orders in the comparable period 
process equipment orders decreased by million to million  primarily due to the continued downturn in the data storage and telecommunications industries 
orders for etch and deposition equipment  sold primarily to the data storage industry  decreased million  from the prior year  while orders for optical filter deposition equipment decreased million from the comparable period 
the decrease in process equipment orders is offset in part by a million increase in mbe orders  primarily to telecommunications and research customers 
metrology orders increased by million to million  reflecting a increase in orders for afms as well as a increase in orders for optical metrology products 
the book to bill ratio for the year ended december   which is calculated by dividing orders received in a given time period by revenue recognized in that same time period  was to for the year ended december   the company experienced order cancellations of million  the majority of which related to the data storage and optical telecommunications market 
the company also experienced rescheduling of order delivery dates by customers 
due to the weak business environment  the company may continue to experience cancellation and or rescheduling of orders 
during the years ended december  and  the company incurred merger and restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  of which million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  respectively  related to the write off of inventory  which is included in cost of sales 
gross profit for the year ended december   decreased to from in excluding the merger and restructuring charges in both years  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to from 
the decreased gross margin is primarily due to the significant volume decrease from the prior year  particularly in process equipment sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million  or of sales  for the year ended december  represented a decrease of million  or  from million in the expense is higher as a percentage of sales due to the decrease in sales volume from the dollar decrease is principally attributable to a decrease in selling and commission expense resulting from the decreased sales volume  as well as cost reduction efforts implemented by the company 
the decrease is partially offset by a million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of the applied epi and tm subsidiaries  both of which were acquired by the company during the third quarter of research and development expense for the year ended december   of million represented a decrease of million  or  from the comparable period of  due primarily to cost reduction efforts implemented by the company in all product areas  except for afm 
this decrease is offset in part by the impact of million in research and development expense of applied epi and tm 
amortization expense for the year ended december   of million represented an increase of million from the comparable period of  due primarily to the intangible assets acquired during the third quarter of in connection with the applied epi and tm acquisitions 
this amount is offset in part by million of reduced amortization expense related to the accounting requirement to no longer amortize goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective on january  under sfas no 
 goodwill is to be reviewed annually for impairment 
as previously mentioned  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of in conjunction with the plan announced by the company in october to reduce operating costs by million in  as well as the continued weakness in the company s served markets and the uncertainty of their recovery  the company recorded merger and restructuring charges of approximately million during the fourth quarter of the million in future cost savings is expected to affect each of the four quarters of in addition  it is anticipated that of the million in cost savings  approximately million is to reduce cost of sales  and approximately million will reduce operating expenses  including selling  general and administrative expenses 
of the million charge  approximately million will require future cash outlays 
the million charge consisted of a inventory write down included in cost of sales in the process equipment segment  due to rationalization and discontinuance of certain product lines  million of personnel costs and business relocation  million of merger related expenses  million for a prepayment penalty on early extinguishment of debt and million in asset impairment charges  primarily in the process equipment segment 
the million in asset impairment charges included a million write down of goodwill  million for the impairment of two buildings and million for the impairment of other fixed assets see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
in light of current economic conditions  as well as the significant decline in process equipment sales  the company implemented a plan to rationalize certain product lines  which required discontinuance or modification of several products 
as a result of the significant reduction in sales volume and the rationalization of product lines  excess plant capacity existed 
part of the plan to reduce future operating costs consisted of consolidation or elimination of certain facilities resulting in the reduction of excess capacity 
the plan includes closing two process equipment manufacturing facilities  in fort collins  colorado and rochester  new york 
the manufacturing activities of the rochester facility ceased as of december   and the manufacturing activities of the fort collins facility are in the process of being phased out 
the manufacturing at both of these sites will be transferred to the company s plainview  new york facility 
as a result of this reorganization  the company recorded an inventory write down of approximately million 
in connection with these actions  certain products sold to the data storage industry were discontinued 
these products include certain physical vapor deposition equipment 
a portion of this product line s inventory is not useable and thus has been written off by the company 
the million charge also consists of the discontinuance or modification of certain telecommunications product lines  due to the continued decline in the telecommunications industry 
this industry has seen a significant decline due to excess of fiber optic capacity created by telephonic carriers as well as current economic conditions  which have resulted in a significant decrease in capital spending 
the million charge for personnel costs and business relocation includes severance costs of approximately million and business relocation costs of approximately million 
the severance charges relate to a workforce reduction of approximately employees  located in all operations of the company 
the majority of the job classifications affected were in production  purchasing  engineering  service  sales and marketing and were concentrated in the process equipment segment 
business relocation costs of million include costs related to rental payments and or lease termination fees on lease agreements relating to locations vacated by the company 
in addition  the business relocation costs include operating costs of the rochester facility that has ceased manufacturing operations 
these operating costs will be incurred while the building is being marketed for sale 
as of december   approximately million in termination benefits has been paid and approximately million remains accrued  which will be paid by the third quarter of as of december   approximately million of business relocation costs has been paid and approximately million remains accrued 
of the million remaining  approximately million is expected to be paid in the first quarter of  million is expected to be paid by the end of and approximately million in the aggregate is anticipated to be paid monthly through the third quarter of on july   the company entered into a merger agreement with fei  headquartered in hillsboro  oregon 
on january   the agreement was terminated 
veeco incurred approximately million in expenses related to the proposed merger with fei 
merger related costs were accounted for as an asset  and the company intended to allocate these direct costs to the purchase price of the acquisition 
however  due to the termination of the merger agreement  these costs were written off 
these costs include legal  accounting  tax  investment banking and regulatory fees and printing costs 
as of december   million of these costs have been paid and approximately million remains accrued  which will be paid in the first quarter of in conjunction with the restructuring in the process equipment segment and the closure of two manufacturing facilities  the company has classified the two facilities as held for sale as of december  in accordance with sfas no 
 these facilities are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
accordingly  an impairment charge of million was recorded by the company 
fair value was determined by the company based upon recent market data 
land  buildings and other fixed assets held for sale of approximately million are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  the sale of these two facilities is expected to occur by the end of certain machinery and equipment and furniture and fixtures with a net book value of million  the majority of which is a result of the closing of the rochester facility  were deemed to have no future value and  thus  the company has written off those assets and has included this charge in asset impairment in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  as a result of the rochester facility being available for sale  the company paid down a term loan and mortgage related to the building 
due to the prepayment of the term loan  the company was required to pay a penalty of approximately million in december  which is included in the merger and restructuring charge in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  during the three months ended september   the company incurred a restructuring charge of approximately million related to cost reduction efforts in response to continuing poor industry conditions and the decreased level of new orders 
the million charge includes severance related costs for approximately management and manufacturing employees principally located in the process equipment segment 
as of december   approximately million has been expended and approximately million remains accrued  which is anticipated to be paid in the first quarter of this charge is offset in part by approximately million of income related to the settlement of a post retirement benefit plan of the process equipment segment 
during the three months ended june   the company incurred a restructuring charge of approximately million related to the reductions in work force announced in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of the million charge includes severance related costs for approximately employees  which included both management and manufacturing employees principally located in the process equipment segment 
as of december   approximately million has been expended and approximately million remains accrued  which is expected to be paid in the first quarter of during the three months ended march   the company incurred a restructuring charge of million related to the reduction in work force announced in the fourth quarter of this charge includes severance related costs for approximately employees  which included both management and manufacturing employees located at the company s minnesota metrology and new york process equipment operations 
as of december   this accrual was fully expended 
other income  net  for the year ended december  improved to million over the comparable period from other expense  net  of million  due to a decrease in foreign currency exchange losses  which occurred principally in the first quarter of interest expense  net  of million for the year ended december   increased million from the comparable period as a result of the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes  which occurred in december and january income taxes for the year ended december  amounted to a benefit of million  or of loss before income taxes  as compared with income tax expense of million  or of income before income taxes in the lower effective tax rate for is due to approximately million of non deductible charges related to the write down of goodwill under sfas no 
in connection with the sale of its industrial measurement segment in may  the company recorded an additional million loss on the disposal of the discontinued operations during the year ended december   net of approximately million of taxes 
years ended december  and net sales were million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million  or  when compared to the year ended december  sales in the us  europe  japan and asia pacific  accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net sales for the year ended december  sales in the us increased by approximately million from the increase in us sales is primarily attributable to a million increase in process equipment sales  due to increased etch and deposition equipment sales to the data storage industry  as well as increased sales of optical filter deposition products to the telecommunications industry 
sales of mbe equipment have also contributed to the increase in us process equipment sales by approximately million over the comparable period  which have no comparable mbe sales 
european sales increased by million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this increase is primarily a result of a increase in process equipment sales 
the increase is a result of a million increase in etch and deposition products sold primarily to the data storage industry  a million increase in sales of optical filter deposition products sold principally to the telecommunications industry and million of sales of mbe equipment sold mainly to the telecommunications industry 
metrology sales in europe increased by  which was principally the result of an increase of million  or  in afm sales to the semiconductor and research industrial industries 
of the million  million was attributable to sales from the company s tm microscopes subsidiary  which was acquired in july of using the purchase method of accounting  and therefore there were no comparable sales in the increase was slightly offset by a million decline in optical metrology sales of interferometry products to the data storage and semiconductor industries 
sales in japan increased by million over the prior year  primarily as a result of increased metrology sales of for afms and for optical metrology products 
japan s process equipment sales remained relatively flat compared to the prior period 
sales in asia pacific decreased by million over the comparable period  as a result of decreased sales in optical metrology products 
this decrease resulted from the decline in sales of the slider level crown slc product line of approximately million to data storage customers over the prior comparable period  which was partially offset by an increase in afm sales 
the company believes that there will continue to be quarter to quarter variations in the geographic concentration of sales 
process equipment sales of million for the year ended december   increased million  or  over the prior year  due partially to a million increase in optical filter deposition sales to the telecommunications industry 
etch and deposition product sales  principally to the data storage market  also increased by million over the prior year 
mbe sales  as a result of the applied epi acquisition  were million during the year ended december  metrology sales of million for the year ended december  increased by million from the year ended december   reflecting a increase in the sale of afms  primarily to the semiconductor and research industrial industries  offset by a decrease in sales of optical metrology products  which was attributable to the above mentioned decrease in sales of the slc product line to data storage customers and a million decrease in interferometry sales  for the most part to the data storage and semiconductor industries  from the year ended december  veeco received million of orders for the year ended december   representing a decrease from million of orders in the comparable period 
process equipment orders decreased to million  primarily due to the significant business downturn in the telecommunications industry 
orders for optical filter deposition equipment decreased million from the comparable period 
orders for etch and deposition equipment  sold primarily to the data storage industry  decreased by million from the prior year 
metrology orders decreased to million  reflecting a decrease in orders for afms as well as a decrease in orders for optical metrology products 
the order declines are a result of the general economic slowdown that has had a very significant impact on the telecommunications  data storage and semiconductor markets that the company serves 
the book to bill ratio for the year ended december  was to for the year ended december   the company experienced order cancellations of million  of which approximately million related to the optical telecommunications market  for which veeco is a significant supplier 
from through the beginning of  the telecommunications industry experienced rapid and unprecedented growth 
in connection with this growth  telecommunications companies spent billions of dollars installing long haul optical networks in order to meet growing telecommunications needs 
these networks use a technology called dense wavelength division multiplexing dwdm 
certain of veeco s ion beam systems are used to manufacture dwdm filters  which create multiple optical channels that can be carried by optical fiber 
during this period dwdm filters were in extremely high demand  which created a worldwide shortage 
in order to keep up with this demand  optical telecommunications customers placed numerous multi unit system orders that were to be shipped over multiple quarters 
in early  it became apparent that many of these optical telecommunications customers had accumulated too much debt and constructed too many optical networks 
this caused these companies to reduce their capital spending  and as a result  demand for the filters started to evaporate 
many customers cancelled a majority of their multi unit orders 
by the end of the second quarter of  a substantial amount of the backlog for systems used for manufacturing dwdm filters had been cancelled 
during the years ended december  and  the company incurred merger and restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  of which million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  respectively  related to the write off of inventory  which is included in cost of sales 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased to from in excluding the merger and restructuring charges in both years  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to from due primarily to a mix change resulting in an increase in process equipment sales with lower average gross margins  as well as a decline in optical metrology sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  increased by million compared to million in the dollar increase is related to increased sales volume  primarily in the afm product line and deposition equipment for optical filters 
research and development expense for the year ended december  of million  increased by million over the comparable period of  due primarily to additional research and development in certain ion tech and afm product areas  as well as the inclusion of the newly acquired businesses of applied epi and tm  which were not included in veeco s spending in amortization expense for the year ended december   of million  increased by million over the comparable period of  due to the intangible assets acquired in connection with applied epi and tm acquisitions 
other expense  net for the year ended december  increased million over the comparable period  due to the impact of foreign currency exchange losses  principally in the first quarter of during the year ended december   the company recorded restructuring charges of approximately million in response to the significant downturn in the telecommunications industry and the overall weak business environment 
this downturn has affected veeco s customers ability to purchase capital equipment and is evidenced by a significant decline in the order rate for the company s products 
the million charge consisted of a million write off of inventory included in cost of sales related to order cancellations and the rationalization of certain product lines  million related to personnel costs and business relocation and million was for the write down of long lived assets 
of the million write off of inventory  approximately million was associated with the company s process equipment segment  which sells primarily to the telecommunications and data storage industries and approximately million related to veeco s metrology segment  which sells mainly to the semiconductor  research and data storage industries 
during the year  veeco experienced a significant amount of order cancellations for products for which many of the raw materials had been purchased prior to the cancellation date due to the amount of lead time necessary to build many of these tools 
the million charge for personnel and business relocation costs principally relates to plant consolidations and a workforce reduction of approximately employees  located in all operations of the company 
the majority of the job classifications that were eliminated included manufacturing  sales and marketing  due to the downturn in the economy 
as of december   approximately million of personnel and business relocation costs have been paid and approximately million remains accrued 
of this million liability  approximately million relates to rental payments on a lease agreement for space the company has vacated and will be paid over the next three years and million relates to termination costs that will be paid in the first quarter of the write down of long lived assets to estimated fair value related primarily to the write off of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in connection with the slc product line of approximately million  which has been phased out  as well as the write down of certain machinery and equipment of approximately million  which was deemed to have no future value 
in connection with the applied epi acquisition  the company recorded a million write off of the fair values of acquired in process technology projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
accordingly  this amount was expensed at the acquisition date 
applied epi s in process technology value is comprised of programs related to research systems  production systems  performance products and metal organic chemical vapor deposition mocvd systems that were approximately   and complete  respectively  at the date of acquisition 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by using the income approach  which involves estimating the discounted after tax cash flows attributable to projects  based on the projects stage of completion 
the rate used to discount net cash flows to their present value was 
as of december   programs related to both research and performance products are complete 
as of december   programs related to production systems are complete  with one program being cancelled and one program being postponed due to current market and business conditions 
with regard to the mocvd systems  due to the current market and business conditions and as a result of the company s reorganization in the process equipment segment see note  these programs have been abandoned by the company 
in connection with the tm acquisition  approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to in process technology projects for projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses and thus  the amounts were expensed as of the date of acquisition 
on the date of acquisition  the majority of tm s in process technology value was comprised of the fanou project which included the aurora iii product  which was approximately complete  with the remainder completed in the first quarter of the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by using the income approach and the rate used to discount net cash flows to their present value was 
the actual results of the fanou project did not differ materially from the underlying assumptions used by the company 
expenditures to complete both applied epi s and tm s projects are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurances can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
additionally  the projects will require maintenance r d after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility 
there are risks associated with these projects  and there is no assurance that these projects will meet with technological or commercial success 
in may  the company sold the remainder of the industrial measurement business 
this segment was comprised of the x ray fluorescence thickness measurement systems 
in january  the company sold its leak detection business  which was part of this segment 
accordingly  the company has classified the industrial measurement business as a discontinued operation 
sales for the industrial measurement business totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the year ended  the company recorded a loss on disposal of discontinued operations of million  which is net of income taxes of million and includes the write off of approximately million of goodwill that was previously allocated to this segment 
during  the company incurred a loss on disposal of its leak detection business of million  which is net of income taxes of million 
loss from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively  which is net of income taxes of million  million and million  respectively 
the assets sold included accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and other current assets and fixed assets and included certain liabilities assumed by the purchaser 
the net assets held for sale of approximately million were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  income taxes for the year ended december  amounted to million  or of income from continuing operations before income taxes as compared with million  or in the higher effective tax rate for is due to approximately million of non deductible charges related to the million merger and restructuring charges incurred in conjunction with the merger with cvc 
liquidity and capital resources although the company experienced an operating cash use of million during  funds from the sale of its industrial measurement business of million  as well as proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment of million and funds from financing activities  including the issuance of a million over allotment of subordinated debt and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock issuances under the company s employee stock purchase plan  were sufficient to fund capital expenditures and debt repayments 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at the end of  compared with at the end of the company s primary source of funds at december   consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents 
this amount represents an increase of million from the december  balance of million 
cash used by operations totaled million during the year ended december  this amount consisted primarily of the net loss of million plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  net loss on the disposal of discontinued operations  non cash restructuring and other expenses  and a stock option income tax benefit aggregating million  as well as a decrease in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively 
accounts receivable decreased due to the decrease in sales during the fourth quarter of receivables generally are due within days  other than customers in japan where payment terms range from days 
these items were offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  deferred profit and other current liabilities and an increase in deferred taxes of million  million and million  respectively 
deferred profit for the year ended december   decreased by million  primarily as a result of revenue recognition on tools that received final customer acceptance  as well as a decrease in the number of tools that are deferred as of december   due to a lower level of sales and product mix that impacts timing of revenue recognition 
accrued expenses and other current liabilities excluding deferred profit decreased million  primarily as a result of a million decrease in customer deposits and royalties  a million decrease in accrued installation and warranty  and million of tax payments made during the year related to sales and foreign taxes 
in addition  accrued expenses decreased as a result of a million decline in accrued bonuses and commission expense related to the decline in sales volume and orders  as well as a million decrease in other employee benefits due to the reduction in workforce previously discussed 
cash flows from investing activities of million for the year ended december  are a result of the proceeds from the sale of the company s industrial measurement business of million  which closed in may  proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment of million and net maturities of long term investments of million  offset by capital expenditures of million 
in december  the company issued million of convertible subordinated notes  and in january  the company issued an additional million of notes pursuant to an over allotment option 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the company pays interest on these notes on june and december of each year 
the notes will mature on december  in connection with this offering  the company purchased approximately million of us government securities  which have been pledged to the trustee under the indenture  as security for the exclusive benefit of the holders of the notes 
these securities will be sufficient to provide for the payment in full of the first six scheduled interest payments due on the notes and thus represent restricted investments 
the balance of these pledged securities as of december  was million 
except with respect to these pledged securities  the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all other indebtedness of the company 
the notes are repayable upon certain change of control events and upon the acceleration of certain other indebtedness for money borrowed of the company 
after the third anniversary of issuance  the notes may be redeemed at the option of the company at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture relating to the notes 
cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million 
the generation of cash from financing activities in primarily resulted from the million subordinated debt over allotment option exercise in january  as well as million from stock issuance  offset in part by million of repayments of long term debt and debt issuance costs 
on april   the company entered into a million revolving credit facility as amended  the facility 
the facility s interest rate is a floating rate based on the prime rate of the lending banks and is adjustable to a maximum rate of above the prime rate in the event the company s ratio of debt to cash flows exceeds a defined amount 
a libor based interest rate option is also provided 
the facility has a term of four years and borrowings under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital and acquisitions 
the facility contains certain restrictive covenants  which among other things  impose limitations with respect to the incurrence of indebtedness  the payment of dividends  long term leases  investments  mergers  acquisitions  consolidations and sales of assets 
the company is also required to satisfy certain financial tests and the accounts receivable of the company and its material domestic subsidiaries are pledged to secure the company s obligations under the facility 
in connection with a recent amendment of the facility  certain financial covenants were amended to allow for the fourth quarter restructuring charges as well as certain definitions were amended 
as of december   and for all prior periods  the company was in compliance with the covenants set forth in the facility 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility  and the company was contingently liable for letters of credit of approximately million issued under the facility 
in october  the company repaid one of its mortgages upon maturity in the amount of approximately million 
in february  in connection with a lawsuit commenced by toyo  the company agreed in principle to settle the lawsuit see note of the consolidated financial statements of the company for further discussion 
at december   veeco s contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to its debt obligations and lease payments are as follows in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt    operating leases      letters of credit   the company believes that existing cash balances together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the company s million facility will be sufficient to meet the company s projected working capital and other cash flow requirements for the next twelve months  as well as the company s contractual obligations  detailed in the above table  over the next five years 
application of critical accounting policies general veeco s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon veeco s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires veeco to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets and other long lived assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring costs and contingent litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  the valuation of inventories  the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and the impairment of long lived assets to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition effective january  the company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for products produced according to the company s published specifications  where no installation is required or installation is deemed perfunctory and no substantive customer acceptance provisions exist  revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer  generally upon shipment 
for products produced according to a particular customer s specifications  revenue is recognized when the product has been tested and it has been demonstrated that it meets the customer s specifications and title passes to the customer 
the amount of revenue recorded is reduced by the amount of any customer retention generally to  which is not payable by the customer until installation is completed and final customer acceptance is achieved 
the amount of customer retention is recorded in accounts receivable with a corresponding liability recorded in deferred profit 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred profit pertaining to customer retentions 
installation is not deemed to be essential to the functionality of the equipment since installation does not involve significant changes to the features or capabilities of the equipment or building complex interfaces and connections 
in addition  the equipment could be installed by the customer or other vendors and generally the cost of installation approximates only to of the sales value of the related equipment 
for new applications of the company s products  for new products or for products with substantive customer acceptance provisions where performance cannot be fully assessed prior to meeting customer specifications at the customer site  revenue is recognized upon completion of installation and receipt of final customer acceptance 
since title to goods generally passes to the customer upon shipment and to of the contract amount becomes payable at that time  inventory is relieved and accounts receivable is recorded for the entire contract amount 
the profit on these transactions is deferred and recorded as deferred profit in the accompanying balance sheets 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  are recorded in deferred profit pertaining to shipments where revenue recognition has been deferred 
service and maintenance contract revenues are recorded as deferred revenue  which is included in other accrued expenses  and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the service period of the related contract 
the company provides for warranty costs at the time the related revenue is recognized 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally first in  first out method or market 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a quarterly basis 
the company s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage for the next to month s requirements is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to veeco s future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence  possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment the company has significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if it is determined that impairment indicators are present and that the assets will not be fully recoverable  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair value 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  an historic or anticipated decline in revenue or operating profit  adverse legal or regulatory developments  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of amounts originally expected to acquire the asset and a material decrease in the fair value of some or all of the assets 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these assumptions  and thus veeco may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
the company completed the first of the required impairment tests on goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the first quarter of based upon the judgment of management  it was determined that there was no impairment to goodwill or intangibles with indefinite lives as of january  during the fourth quarter of  management determined that due to the continued weakness in the telecommunications industry and the uncertainty of the timing and speed of recovery  impairment indicators were present 
under sfas no 
 if impairment indicators are present  the fair value of the reporting unit must be determined 
based upon the judgment of management  goodwill arising from the september applied epi acquisition  which constitutes the telecommunications reporting unit  included in the process equipment operating segment  was deemed significantly impaired 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million and has written down goodwill related to the telecommunications reporting unit to approximately million as of december  long lived asset impairment the carrying values of long lived assets are periodically reviewed to determine if any impairment indicators are present 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining depreciation period  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair value 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  an historic or anticipated decline in revenue or operating profit  adverse legal or regulatory developments  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of amounts originally expected to acquire the asset and a material decrease in the fair value of some or all of the assets 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
during  million in fixed asset impairment charges were recorded by the company  in conjunction with the restructuring in the process equipment segment 
the company recorded million of fixed asset impairment charges in assumptions utilized by management in reviewing for impairment of long lived assets could be effected by changes in strategy and or market conditions which may require veeco to record additional impairment charges for these assets  as well as impairment charges on other long lived assets not previously recorded 
during december  approximately million of intangible assets were written off in connection with a phased out product line 
risk factors that may impact future results in addition to the other information set forth herein  the following risk factors should be carefully considered by shareholders of and by potential investors in the company 
we depend on the microelectronics industry 
the cyclicality of the data storage  telecommunications wireless  semiconductor  research and industrial industries directly affects our business 
veeco s business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of data storage  telecommunications wireless and semiconductor manufacturers  as well as research and industrial customers  which accounted for the following percentages of our net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  data storage telecommunications wireless semiconductor research and industrial the data storage  telecommunications wireless  semiconductor  research and industrial industries are cyclical 
these industries have experienced significant economic downturns at various times in the last decade  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production overcapacity 
a downturn in one or more of these industries or the businesses of one or more of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
the current global downturn in general economic conditions and in the markets for our customers products is resulting in a reduction in demand for some of our products 
we have experienced the effects of the global economic downturn in many areas of our business 
during this downturn and any subsequent downturns we cannot assure you that our sales or margins will not decline 
as a capital equipment provider  our revenues depend in large part on the spending patterns of our customers  who often delay expenditures or cancel orders in reaction to variations in their businesses or general economic conditions 
because a high proportion of our costs are fixed  our ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to revenue short falls is limited 
in a prolonged economic downturn  we may not be able to reduce our significant fixed costs  such as continued investment in research and development or capital equipment requirements 
in addition  during an economic downturn we may experience delays in collecting receivables  which may impose constraints on our working capital 
our customers may be adversely affected by rapid technological change and we may be unable to maintain timely product introduction 
the data storage  telecommunications wireless  semiconductor manufacturing  research and industrial industries are subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
our ability to remain competitive will depend in part upon our ability to develop in a timely and cost effective manner new and enhanced systems at competitive prices and to accurately predict technology transitions 
in addition  new product introductions or enhancements by our competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing products 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price competition resulting in lower margins  which could materially and adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
our success in developing  introducing and selling new and enhanced systems depends upon a variety of factors  including our product offerings  timely and efficient completion of product design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing processes  effective sales  service and marketing  and product performance in the field 
because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales  new product decisions must anticipate both the future demand for the products under development and the equipment required to produce such products 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or in enhancing existing products 
the process of developing new high technology capital equipment products and services is complex and uncertain  and failure to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately and to develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property could significantly harm our results of operations 
we must make long term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will eventually result in products that the market will accept 
we have invested significant resources in the development of certain products utilizing physical vapor deposition technology  which has been slow to gain customer acceptance 
further  after a product is developed  we must be able to manufacture sufficient volumes quickly and at low costs 
to accomplish this  we must accurately forecast volumes  mix of products and configurations that meet customer requirements  and we may not succeed 
we depend on a limited number of customers that operate in highly concentrated industries 
we rely on certain principal customers for a significant portion of our sales 
based on net sales  seagate technology  inc is our top customer 
the following table sets forth the percentage of our net sales to seagate our only customer with sales greater than in any of the past three years for the following periods year ended december  seagate if any principal customer discontinues its relationship with us or suffers economic setbacks  our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
our ability to increase sales in the future will depend in part upon our ability to obtain orders from new customers 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so 
in addition  because a relatively small number of large manufacturers  many of whom are our customers  dominate the industries in which they operate  it may be especially difficult for us to replace these customers if we lose their business 
a substantial portion of orders in our backlog are orders from our principal customers 
because we do not have long term contracts with our customers  our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time if we fail to meet their needs 
we do not have long term contracts with our customers 
as a result  our agreements with our customers do not provide any assurance of future sales 
accordingly our customers can cease purchasing our products at any time without penalty  our customers are free to purchase products from our competitors  we are exposed to competitive price pressure on each order  and our customers are not required to make minimum purchases 
if we do not succeed in obtaining new sales orders from new or existing customers  it will have a negative impact on our results of operations 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly 
our quarterly results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect this trend to continue 
factors which affect our quarterly results include cyclical patterns of capital spending by customers  changes in the market for personal computers  network servers  telecommunication wireless devices or other products incorporating telecommunications wireless  data storage or semiconductor research technology  market acceptance of our systems and our customers products  specific economic conditions in the telecommunications wireless  data storage or semiconductor research industries  our acquisitions and financings  changes in product mix  the timing of significant orders and customer acceptance of our products  the introduction of new products and technological innovations by us and our competitors  production and quality problems and resulting shipment delays  changes in the cost of materials  and disruption in our sources of supply 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
if our new orders  net sales or operating results in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  our stock price may be adversely affected 
our business and financial results for a particular period could be materially and adversely affected if orders are cancelled or rescheduled or if an anticipated order for even one system is not received in time to permit shipping during the period 
customer purchase orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer  generally with limited or no penalties 
in addition  veeco has  in limited circumstances  permitted major customers to return previously shipped products in order to maintain business relationships with such customers 
therefore  backlog or the amount of purchase orders at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
in addition  we derive a substantial portion of our net sales in any fiscal period from the sale of a relatively small number of high priced systems 
as a result  the timing of recognition of revenue for a single transaction could have a material effect on our sales and operating results for a particular fiscal period 
backlog adjustments for the year ended december  included order cancellations of million 
variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our systems may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
historically  we have experienced long and unpredictable sales cycles 
variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our net sales  and therefore our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows  to fluctuate widely from period to period 
these variations often are based upon factors partially or completely outside our control 
the factors that affect the length of time it takes us to complete a sale depend upon many elements  including the efforts of our sales force and our independent sales representatives  the history of previous sales to a customer  the complexity of the customer s manufacturing processes  the internal technical capabilities and sophistication of the customer  and the capital expenditure budget cycle of our customers 
as a result of these and a number of other factors that influence our sales cycles with particular customers  the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer  if ever  varies widely 
our sales cycle typically can range up to twelve months 
sometimes our sales cycle can be much longer  particularly during an economic downturn or when the sales cycle involves developing new applications for our systems and technology 
during these cycles  we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts before receiving any revenue  and we may never receive any revenue from a customer despite these sales efforts 
in addition to lengthy and sometimes unpredictable sales cycles  the build cycle  or the time it takes us to build a product to customer specifications  typically ranges from one to six months 
during this period  the customer may cancel its order  although generally it will be required to pay us a fee based on which stage of the build cycle we have completed 
for many of our products  after a customer purchases one of our systems we provide an acceptance period during which the customer may evaluate the performance of the system and potentially reject the system 
in addition  customers often evaluate the performance of one of our systems for a lengthy period before purchasing any additional systems 
the number of additional products a customer may purchase from us  if any  often depends on many factors that are difficult for us to predict accurately  including a customer s capacity requirements and changing market conditions for its products 
as a result of these evaluation periods and other factors  the period between a customer s initial purchase and subsequent purchases  if any  often varies widely  and variations in length of this period can cause further fluctuations in our operating results 
our strategy of pursuing acquisitions subjects us to risks associated with evaluating and pursuing these opportunities and integrating these businesses into our business 
we have considered numerous acquisition opportunities and completed several significant acquisitions during the past five years 
in addition  we may consider acquisitions of  or significant investments in  other businesses in the future 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control  including difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel  operations  technologies and products of acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other operational matters while evaluating and pursuing the acquisition as well as while integrating the business once acquired  the inability to retain the key employees of acquired companies  especially if the acquired business is to be relocated or the responsibilities of such key employees are to be changed  lack of synergy  or inability to realize expected synergies  resulting from the acquisition  and acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance by the acquired company  which could require us to record a charge to earnings for such impairment 
our inability to effectively manage these acquisition risks could materially and adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  if we issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition  the ownership percentage of our then existing shareholders would be reduced and the value of the shares held by our then existing shareholders could be diluted  which could affect the trading price of our common stock and of the subordinated notes 
if we use cash to pay for an acquisition  the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund our operations or to use for other purposes  including making payments on the subordinated notes 
also  acquisition financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
future acquisitions may also require us to assume contingent liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition or operating results 
the loss of key management or our inability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of managerial  engineering and other technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our continued success depends  in part  upon key managerial  engineering and technical personnel as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional personnel 
in particular  we depend on our chairman and chief executive officer  edward h 
braun 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition or operating results 
we may not be able to retain our key managerial  engineering and technical employees 
our growth is dependent on our ability to attract new highly skilled and qualified technical personnel  in addition to personnel that can implement and monitor our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems 
attracting qualified personnel is difficult  and we cannot assure you that our recruiting efforts to attract and retain these personnel will be successful 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully in our highly competitive industries 
the industries in which we operate are intensely competitive 
established companies  both domestic and foreign  compete with each of our product lines 
many of our competitors have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than us 
a substantial investment is required by customers to install and integrate capital equipment into a production line 
as a result  once a manufacturer has selected a particular vendor s capital equipment  we believe that the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for the specific production line application and frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor 
accordingly  if a particular customer selects a competitor s capital equipment  we expect to experience difficulty selling to that customer for a significant period of time 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside of our control  including price  product quality  breadth of product line  system performance  cost of ownership  global technical service and support  and success in developing or otherwise introducing new products 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 
we are exposed to the risks of operating a global business  including risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations and legal and regulatory changes 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks that are inherent in our anticipated sales  sales commitments and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
failure to sufficiently hedge or otherwise manage foreign currency risks properly could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins 
we also are exposed to interest rate risks inherent in our debt obligations and investment portfolios 
in  approximately of our total net sales were generated from sales outside the united states  and in approximately our total net sales were generated from sales outside the united states 
we expect sales from non us markets to continue to represent a significant  and possibly increasing portion of our total sales in the future 
our non us sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad  many of which are outside our control  including periodic economic downturns and unstable political environments  longer sales cycles  multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies  price and currency exchange controls  fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  difficulties protecting intellectual property  unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  and difficulties in managing a global enterprise  including staffing  collecting accounts receivable  managing distributors and representatives and repatriation of earnings 
changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may  in some instances  have a material effect on our results of operations 
in particular  a weakening of the euro or the yen could result in a weakening of our overall financial results 
although we attempt to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  these hedging activities may not always be available or adequate to eliminate  or even mitigate  the impact of our exchange rate exposure 
as a result of this exchange rate exposure  as well as the other factors listed above  we may experience a material adverse effect upon our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we enter into monthly forward contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on short term foreign currency denominated intercompany balances and other known currency exposures 
the average notional amount of such contracts was approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   we did not have any open forward contracts 
we estimate that based upon our balance sheet at december   a change in foreign exchange rates impact operating loss by approximately million 
our operating results are influenced by the performance of asian economies  which have experienced significant downturns during the past few years 
in recent years  asian economies including japan have been highly volatile and recessionary  resulting in significant fluctuations in local currencies and other instabilities 
approximately of our sales in and approximately of our sales in were derived from this region 
instabilities in asian economies including japan may continue and recur again in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
our exposure to the business risks presented by asian economies including japan will increase to the extent we continue to expand our operations in that region 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement 
several of our competitors hold patents covering a variety of technologies included in some of our products 
in addition  some of our customers may use our microelectronics products for applications that are similar to those covered by these patents 
from time to time  we and our customers have received correspondence from our competitors claiming that some of our products  as used by our customers  may be infringing one or more of these patents 
as of the date of this filing  none of these allegations has resulted in litigation 
competitors or others may  however  assert infringement claims against us or our customers in the future with respect to current or future products or uses  and these assertions may result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license to use intellectual property rights of others 
if claims of infringement are asserted against our customers  those customers may seek indemnification from us for damages or expenses they incur 
if we become subject to infringement claims  we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives  which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question or defending our position 
these licenses  however  may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all 
if we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
we are exposed to the risks that third parties may violate our proprietary rights and our intellectual property rights may not be well protected in foreign countries 
our success depends on the protection of our proprietary rights 
in our industry  intellectual property is an important asset that is always at risk of infringement 
we incur costs to obtain and maintain patents and defend our intellectual property 
we rely upon the laws of the united states and of other countries in which we develop  manufacture or sell our products to protect our proprietary rights 
however  these proprietary rights may not provide the competitive advantages that we expect  or other parties may challenge  invalidate or circumvent these rights 
further  our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the united states 
many us companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in foreign countries 
we derived approximately of our sales from foreign countries in  and approximately of our sales from foreign countries in if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries  it could be easier for our competitors to sell competing products 
infringement of our proprietary rights by a third party could result in lost market and sales opportunities  as well as increased costs of litigation 
we rely on a limited number of parts  components and equipment manufacturers 
failure of any of these suppliers to perform in a timely or quality manner could negatively impact revenues 
failure of critical suppliers of parts  components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities in a timely and cost effective manner could negatively affect our business 
we currently use numerous vendors to supply parts  components and subassemblies for the manufacture and support of our products 
however  some key parts may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
we also rely on a limited number of equipment manufacturers to develop and supply the equipment used to manufacture our products 
the failure of these manufacturers to develop or deliver equipment on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations 
in addition  as a result of the small number of equipment suppliers  we may be more exposed to future cost increases for this equipment 
we may not obtain sufficient affordable funds to fund our future needs for manufacturing capacity and research and development 
we need to continue to make significant capital expenditures to continue and expand our operations and to enhance our manufacturing capability to keep pace with rapidly changing technologies 
also  our industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development 
if we fail to invest sufficiently in research and development  our products could become less attractive to potential customers 
as a result of our emphasis on research and development and technological innovation  our operating costs may increase in the future 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as a percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
during the past few years  the markets for equity and debt securities have fluctuated significantly  especially with respect to technology related companies  and during some periods offerings of those securities have been extremely difficult to complete 
as a result  in the future we may not be able to obtain the additional funds required to fund our operations and invest sufficiently in research and development on reasonable terms  or at all 
such a lack of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
terrorist acts and acts of war may seriously harm our business and revenues  costs and expenses and financial condition 
terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our company  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  distributors and customers  which could significantly impact our revenues  costs and expenses and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially harm our business and results of operations 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect the business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
we will be largely uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
unforeseen environmental costs could impact our future net earnings 
some of our operations will use substances regulated under various federal  state and international laws governing the environment 
we could be subject to liability for remediation if we do not handle these substances in compliance with applicable laws 
it is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to sites inside and outside the united states  even when not subject to local government regulations 
we will record a liability for environmental remediation and related costs when we consider the costs to be probable and the amount of the costs can be reasonably estimated 
our articles of incorporation  by laws  shareholder rights plan and delaware law may have anti takeover effects which will make an acquisition of our company by another company more difficult 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of these shares without any further vote or action by the holders of our common stock 
we have designated  of those shares as series a junior preferred stock for potential issuance under our shareholder rights plan described below 
the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future may adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock 
the issuance of the preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of veeco that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
furthermore  such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights senior to our common stock and  as a result  the issuance of the preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors with staggered terms 
the existence of a classified board may render certain hostile takeovers more difficult and make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of veeco in certain instances  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of veeco that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
further  if shareholders are dissatisfied with the policies and or decisions of our board of directors  the existence of a classified board will make it more difficult for the shareholders to change the composition and therefore the policies of our board of directors in a relatively short period of time 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan  under which we have granted to our shareholders rights to purchase shares of junior participating preferred stock 
these rights could generally discourage a merger or tender offer for our common stock that is not approved by our board of directors by increasing the cost of effecting any such transaction and  accordingly  could have an adverse impact on a takeover attempt that a shareholder of veeco might consider to be in its best interest 
furthermore  we have adopted and may in the future adopt certain other measures that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of veeco 
certain of such measures may be adopted without any further vote or action by the holders of our common stock 
these measures may have anti takeover effects  which may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
in addition  certain other provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws relating to  without limitation  a actions required to be taken at a meeting of shareholders rather than by written consent  b the percentage of shareholders required to call a special meeting of shareholders  c a limitation on the maximum number of directors  d removal of directors only for cause  and e the percentage of shareholders required to approve amendments to our bylaws  may have anti takeover effects  which may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the general corporation law of the state of delaware  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
a business combination includes mergers  asset sales as well as certain transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder 
subject to certain exceptions  an interested stockholder is a person who  together with affiliates and associates  owns  or within three years did own  or more of the corporation s voting stock 
the operation of section may have anti takeover effects  which may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal market risks ie the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are rates on debt and short term and long term investment portfolios  and exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses 
interest rates veeco centrally manages its debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
veeco s investment portfolios consist of cash equivalents and obligations of us government agencies 
these investments in obligations of the us government are considered held to maturity securities 
accordingly  the amounts are carried at amortized cost 
assuming year end variable debt and investment levels  a one point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on net interest expense 
in december and january  the company issued million of convertible subordinated notes 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the company pays interest on these notes on june and december of each year 
interest payments commenced on june  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the notes will mature on december  after the third anniversary of the issuance  the notes may be redeemed at the option of the company  at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture 
foreign operations operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates  which are volatile at times 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on veeco is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
veeco s net sales to foreign customers represented approximately of veeco s total net sales in  in and in the company expects that net sales to foreign customers will continue to represent a large percentage of veeco s total net sales 
veeco s net sales denominated in foreign currencies represented approximately of veeco s total net sales in  in and in the aggregate foreign exchange gains losses included in determining consolidated results of operations were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in and  the foreign currency exchange gain loss is net of approximately and million of realized hedging losses gains  respectively  which were recorded and included in other income expense  net 
as of december   approximately million of losses related to forward contracts are included in accrued expenses and have been subsequently paid in january as of december   there were no open forward contracts 
veeco is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  veeco uses derivative financial instruments 
veeco does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company enters into monthly forward contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on short term foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions and other known currency exposures 
the average notional amount of such contracts was approximately million for the year ended december  the change in currency exchange rate that has the largest impact on translating veeco s international operating loss profit are the japanese yen and the euro 
the company estimates that based upon its balance sheet at december   a change in foreign exchange rates impact operating loss by approximately million 
the company believes that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing and operating strategies
