statement establishes standards for how companies classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  exposure to certain of these market risks is managed as described below 
interest rates the company s debt structure and interest rate risk are managed through the use of fixed and floating rate debt 
the company s primary exposure is to the london interbank offered rate libor 
a one percent increase in libor would decrease income from continuing operations before income taxes approximately  based on floating rate debt outstanding at september   excluding mni 
interest rate risk in the company s investment portfolio is managed by investing only in securities with a maturity at date of acquisition of days or less 
only high quality investments are considered 
in april  the company liquidated substantially all of its investment portfolio in conjunction with the acquisition of howard 
commodities certain materials used by the company are exposed to commodity price changes 
the company manages this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non cancelable supply contracts 
the company is also involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through identification of sourcing and operating efficiencies 
primary commodity price exposures are newsprint and  to a lesser extent  ink 
a per metric ton newsprint price increase would result in a reduction in income from continuing operations before income taxes of approximately  based on actual consumption in  excluding mni 
sensitivity to changes in value the estimate that follows is intended to measure the maximum potential impact on fair value of fixed rate debt of the company in one year from adverse changes in market interest rates under normal market conditions 
the calculation is not intended to represent the actual loss in fair value that the company expects to incur 
the estimate does not consider favorable changes in market rates 
the position included in the calculation is fixed rate debt  which totals  at september   excluding mni 
the estimated maximum potential one year loss in fair value from a basis point movement in interest rates on market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at september  is approximately  there is no impact on operating results from such changes in interest rates
