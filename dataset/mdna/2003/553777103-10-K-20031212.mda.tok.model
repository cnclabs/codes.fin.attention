item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies fiscal year effective with fiscal year  the company changed its fiscal year end to the saturday closest to september for the years ended september  and september   the company s fiscal year consisted of weeks 
effective with fiscal  the company changed its fiscal quarter ends to the saturday closest to december  march  and june this change had no material impact on comparability of the company s financial statements 
revenue recognition the company implemented the revenue recognition principles of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as of october  the cumulative effect adjustment of the change in accounting for all periods through september  was a reduction in net income of million net of income taxes of million  or per diluted share  which was accounted for as a change to the financial results for the first quarter of fiscal during the fiscal years ended september  and september   the company recognized million and million of revenues  respectively  which were previously recognized prior to the company s adoption of sab for orders that are manufactured and delivered in less than six months with routine installations and no special acceptance protocol  revenue is recognized when systems are shipped and title has passed to the customer  less the greater of the fair value associated with installation or the amount of consideration that is contingent upon installation  which is deferred until customer acceptance 
in cases where special acceptance protocols exist  the company recognizes revenue upon the completion of installation and fulfillment of obligations specific to the terms of the customer s contract 
revenue on contracts requiring longer delivery periods  generally longer than six months long term contracts  is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the cost incurred to date relative to estimated total cost of the contract 
in most cases  orders with complex installations and or unusual acceptance protocols involve long term contracts for custom systems that follow the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition through customer acceptance 
the company enters into long term contracts for customized equipment sold to its customers 
under the terms of such contracts  revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method may not be invoiced until completion of contractual milestones  upon shipment of the equipment  or upon installation and acceptance by the customer 
unbilled amounts for these contracts appear in the consolidated balance sheets as unbilled contracts and retainage receivable 
revenue for services is recognized as the service is performed and ratably over a defined contractual period for service maintenance contracts 
in light of eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  orders that are manufactured and delivered in less than six months with routine installations and no special acceptance protocol are considered to involve separable elements 
sufficient evidence of fair value of these elements exists to allow revenue recognition for these systems upon shipment  less the greater of the fair value associated with installation and training if applicable or the amount of revenue that is deemed contingent upon these elements  which is deferred until customer acceptance 
in cases where special acceptance protocols exist  installation and training are not considered to be separable from the other elements of the arrangement 
accordingly  revenue for these systems is recognized upon the completion of installation and fulfillment of obligations specific to the terms of the arrangement 
for contracts that involve delivery periods generally longer than six months  due to the complexity of installation and acceptance terms  the design  manufacture and installation elements of such arrangements  in aggregate  fall within the scope of accounting literature prescribing percentage of completion accounting through customer acceptance 
however  in light of eitf  when elements that would not separately fall within the scope of accounting literature prescribing percentage of completion accounting are included in an arrangement  the fair value of these elements is separated from the arrangement and accounted for as such services are provided 
inventories inventories at september  and september  are as follows expressed in thousands customer projects in various stages of completion   components  assemblies and parts   total   inventories consist of material  labor  and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost or market  determined under the first in  first out accounting method 
warranty obligations sales of the company s products and systems are subject to limited warranty guarantees that are included in customer contracts 
for sales that include installation services  warranty guarantees typically extend for a period of twelve months from the date of either shipment or acceptance 
product guarantees typically extend for a period of twenty four months from the date of purchase 
under the terms of these warranties  the company is obligated to repair or replace any components or assemblies it deems defective due to workmanship or materials 
the company reserves the right to reject warranty claims where it determines that failure is due to normal wear  customer modifications  improper maintenance  or misuse 
the company records warranty provisions monthly based on an estimated warranty expense percentage applied to current period revenue 
the percentage applied reflects historical warranty incidence over the preceding twelve month period 
both the experience percentage and the warranty liability are evaluated on an ongoing basis for adequacy 
warranty provisions and claims for the years ended september  and september  were as follows expressed in thousands beginning balance   warranty provisions   warranty claims   translation adjustment ending balance   management discussion and analysis customer orders and backlog expressed in thousands customer orders    backlog of undelivered orders    new orders from customers during fiscal totaled million  a decrease of million  or  compared to customer orders of million booked in fiscal in fiscal  customer orders totaled million

in fiscal  the company received one order in excess of million  compared to three such orders in fiscal and one in fiscal  all of which were within the test segment 
the company has been notified of the potential cancellation of a customer order for million

international orders received during fiscal of million increased by million  or  compared to orders received during fiscal of million 
international orders in fiscal totaled million 
the backlog of undelivered orders at september  totaled million  a decrease of approximately million  or  compared to backlog of million at september  backlog at the end of fiscal totaled million 
the decrease in backlog is attributable to a decrease in long cycle versus short cycle orders in fiscal a reduction in large custom project orders accounted for the majority of the decrease in backlog 
the company believes backlog is not an absolute indicator of its future revenue because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog could be cancelled at the customers discretion 
revenue expressed in thousands revenue    revenue of million for fiscal increased million  or  compared to million for fiscal revenue for fiscal totaled million 
on a segment basis  revenue for the test segment in fiscal totaled million  comparing favorably to revenue of million for fiscal and unfavorably to revenue of million for fiscal the increase in revenue for fiscal was principally due to an increase in beginning backlog  partially offset by the timing of large custom projects 
the decrease in revenue for fiscal was principally driven by the decline in capital spending in worldwide industrial and ground vehicles markets 
the shorter cycle businesses  particularly those related to the ground vehicle markets  experienced the largest decline in revenue 
revenue in the industrial segment totaled million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal revenue in the industrial segment increased in fiscal compared to fiscal largely due to sales into new markets as well as customer inventory replenishment in the european sensors business and increased development revenues in the aeromet business

over the past several years  the company has focused on several initiatives in both the test and industrial segments aimed at overall cost control and the alignment of resources with current and anticipated economic conditions and with markets having the greatest potential 
sg a expense in the test segment decreased to million in fiscal from million and million in fiscal and  respectively

in fiscal  general and administrative expenses of the test segment included a provision of million related to the restructuring of the company s manufacturing facility located in france 
the company also recorded million of expenses associated with the closure of its laboratory instruments business that was acquired as part of its acquisition of dsp technology  inc dsp 
sg a expense in the industrial segment in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to an increase in selling expense consistent with the increase in revenue in the sensors business

during fiscal  approximately of r d spending was in the test segment  compared to and  respectively  in fiscal and the overall decrease in r d spending as a percentage of revenue over the three year period is primarily due to management initiatives to focus spending on developments that have the greatest market potential and the highest return opportunity

changes in foreign currency exchange rates the company conducts business in countries outside the united states and is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that can affect its operating results and financial condition 
to minimize this risk  the company manages exposure to changes in foreign currency rates  principally through forward currency exchange contracts to set the dollar value of expected foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  and transactions 
gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
historically  approximately of the company s revenue results from shipments to customers outside the united states  and about of this revenue approximately of the company s total revenue is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies decreases the foreign currency denominated revenue and earnings when they are translated to us dollars 
conversely  a weakening of the us dollar has the reverse effect on revenue and earnings 
gains and losses attributed to translating the financial statements for all non us subsidiaries are included in the currency translation adjustments

the activity related to the provision was materially complete at september   and no additional charges were incurred during fiscal for the three years ended september   september   and september   the reserve for restructuring is as follows year beginning balance provision write off ending balance expressed in thousands recent accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force finalized its tentative consensus on eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which provides guidance on the timing of revenue recognition for sales undertakings to deliver more than one product or service 
the company adopted eitf on transactions occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june   as required 
in light of eitf  orders that are manufactured and delivered in less than six months with routine installations and no special acceptance protocol are considered to involve separable elements 
sufficient evidence of fair value of these elements exists to allow revenue recognition for these systems upon shipment  less the greater of the fair value associated with installation and training if applicable or the amount of revenue that is deemed contingent upon these elements  which is deferred until customer acceptance 
in cases where special acceptance protocols exist  installation and training are not considered to be separable from the other elements of the arrangement 
accordingly  revenue for these systems is recognized upon the completion of installation and fulfillment of obligations specific to the terms of the arrangement 
for contracts that involve delivery periods generally longer than six months  due to the complexity of installation and acceptance terms  the design  manufacture and installation elements of such arrangements  in aggregate  fall within the scope of accounting literature prescribing percentage of completion accounting through customer acceptance 
however  in light of eitf  when elements that would not separately fall within the scope of accounting literature prescribing percentage of completion accounting are included in an arrangement  the fair value of these elements is separated from the arrangement and accounted for as such services are provided 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on the company s fiscal financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging  which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments

quarterly stock activity and financial information revenue and operating results reported on a quarterly basis do not necessarily reflect changes in demand for the company s products or its operating efficiency 
revenue and operating results in any quarter can be significantly affected by customer shipment and or installation timing or the timing of the completion of one or more systems where revenue is recognized upon shipment or customer acceptance rather than on the percentage of completion accounting method 
the company s use of the percentage of completion revenue recognition method for large  long term projects generally has the effect of smoothing significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter
