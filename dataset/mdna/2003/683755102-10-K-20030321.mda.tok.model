the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company believes that the implementation of the following critical accounting policies  used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements  introduce the most significant levels of judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues on the percentage of completion method for its social research and market research segments  which relies on a periodic determination of the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a project can be made 
recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the project progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
these revisions could be material to the company s results of operations 
for the company s teleservices business  revenues are recognized at the time services are performed 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company has significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets  such as non competition agreements 
the determination of the related estimated useful lives involves significant judgments 
changes in those useful lives could be material to the company s results of operations 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other identifiable intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets

 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires the company to analyze its goodwill for impairment in  and then on an annual basis thereafter

as the company continues to expand its international operations  exposures to gains and losses from foreign currency fluctuations will increase

risk factors readers of this report should be aware that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the actual operating results of the company and could cause the company s actual consolidated results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company the company s success depends on its ability to retain its existing clients and obtain new clients 
the company s clients generally may terminate the services it provides to them at any time 
the loss of one or more of the company s large clients or a significant reduction in business from such clients could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the existence of larger projects and long term client relationships may increase the company s reliance on particular projects and clients 
in  approximately of the company s revenue was generated by providing services to various us governmental departments and agencies 
the company s business may suffer if demand for its services declines 
a number of factors that are beyond the company s control can adversely affect the demand of the company s existing clients for its services and impair its ability to attract new clients 
these include marketing budgets  general economic conditions  consolidations  government spending  and other industry specific trends 
changes in management or ownership of an existing client are factors that can affect the client s demand for the company s services 
as a result  the company may provide different amounts of services to its clients from year to year  and these differences can contribute to fluctuations in the company s operating results 
the company s attempts to expand its operations into markets where the company does not currently operate may not be successful and the company s efforts to expand its international operations will be subject to added risks which are inherent in doing business abroad 
part of the company s business strategy is to expand domestically and internationally  and to extend into related businesses through strategic acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to so expand or to identify targets for such acquisitions on terms attractive to the company 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s services will be sufficiently accepted to sustain its efforts to expand in selected international markets 
international expansion will also subject the company to risks inherent in doing business abroad  including adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates  limitations on asset transfers  changes in foreign regulations and political turmoil 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to integrate successfully the operations of any subsequently acquired company with its current operations 
the company s business may suffer if the company is unable to retain its key personnel

the loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company does not currently maintain key man life insurance policies on any of the company s executives other than john f 
short  the company s chief executive officer  and the company has employment agreements only with certain executive officers 
competition for senior management is intense  and the company may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting and retaining other personnel that the company may require in the future 
the company faces competition in its industry 
the company faces competition in connection with most of the individual services and products it provides 
although the company believes that no single competitor offers a comparable combination of services and products  there can be no assurance that other companies  including some with greater financial resources than the company  will not attempt to offer a range of services and products similar to those offered by the company  or otherwise compete more effectively in the market research and information services industry

the terms of the company s current financing agreements prohibit the payment of dividends  and future agreements may also contain terms that limit the amount of dividends the company may pay or prohibit any payment of dividends

the board of directors has also adopted a stockholder rights plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill 
the issuance of preferred stock  the existence of a classified board  and the stockholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company without board approval 
these provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for the company s common stock 
trading volume in the company s common stock has historically been limited 
there is a limited market for the company s common stock 
selling the company s shares may be difficult because smaller quantities of shares are bought and sold and security analysts and the news media s coverage about the company is limited 
these factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for the company s shares
