table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth items from our statements of operations as percentages of net sales net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating income loss non operating expenses income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss we posted net sales of million in  increasing from to and net sales of million in  decreasing from to average product prices increased less than and pipe pounds sold increased  resulting in the increase in net sales in compared to reduced product prices because of an industry wide oversupply of finished goods  and reduced raw material costs were the major causes of the decrease in net sales in compared to average pipe prices decreased by from to pipe pounds sold decreased less than in as compared to and had no material effect on the change in net sales 
gross profit  as a percent of net sales  increased by in as compared to gross profit percentage increased during the first nine months of due to a combination of strong demand for pipe and rising pvc resin and pipe prices 
pvc resin prices increased in the first seven months of due to a strong demand for resin and increasing raw material costs 
the strong demand for pipe in the first six months of allowed us to increase pipe prices at a greater rate than resin prices  thereby increasing our gross profit percentage 
a decrease in pvc resin and pipe prices in the second half of due to a weak economy resulted in a decrease in gross profit percentage in the fourth quarter of this offset some  but not all  of the gains achieved in gross profit percentage in as compared to in addition  the cost reduction measures taken in the second half of have reduced our cost of goods sold  further enhancing our gross profit 
gross profit as a percent of net sales decreased by in as compared to adverse economic conditions originating in the second half of  continued to negatively affect our results of operations in during the second half of  a weakened demand for pipe related to the weakened economy  and decreasing pvc resin and pipe prices  decreased our gross profits 
decreased pipe and resin prices resulted in a lower of cost or market adjustment at year end reducing pipe inventory by million and million in and  respectively 
the demand for pipe was further reduced by the reluctance of distributors to purchase pipe for inventory when pipe prices were dropping  and market conditions caused pipe prices to drop at a faster rate than resin prices 
during  the supply of pipe and pvc resin continued to be greater than demand for pipe and pvc resin 
these continuing oversupply conditions caused pvc resin and pipe prices to drop throughout the year  resulting in further decreases in gross profits 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by in as compared to the decrease is primarily the result of restructuring costs of million incurred in the third quarter of the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in as compared to is the result of decreased net sales in combination with certain fixed operating expenses 
actual operating expenses  including the million restructuring cost recorded in the third quarter  have decreased by million  or  as compared to operating expenses in the decrease in non operating expense in is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest rates for the unhedged portion of debt  a reduction in the balance of the revolving credit facility and continued payments on 
table of contents the long term debt 
the actual decrease in non operating expenses in as compared to of million or is primarily attributable to a decrease in the interest rates for the unhedged portion of the debt  continued payments on the long term debt and the absence of expenses totaling million related to a change in estimate to terminated acquisition costs recorded in these expense savings were partially offset by an increase in the revolver credit balance of our senior credit facility due to the repurchase of stock in connection with our modified dutch auction completed in the second quarter of  as well as a loss resulting from the write off of non productive assets in the fourth quarter of the income tax provision tax benefit for the twelve months ended december  and were calculated based on management s estimates of the annual effective tax rate for the year 
the annual effective tax rate for reflects our statutory federal and applicable state tax rates of approximately  up from in the rate was impacted by rate increases in certain states in which we operate  offset by an adjustment of accruals associated with certain tax contingencies 
liquidity and capital resources on february   we entered into amended loan agreements with the lenders of our senior credit facility and holders of the senior subordinated notes  and completed a sale leaseback transaction for certain of our manufacturing facilities and the eugene office building 
in connection with these revisions  the lenders of the senior credit facility and holders of the senior subordinated notes waived any event of default arising from the company s past inability to comply with the financial covenants of these agreements 
as a result of these transactions  principal payments under the revised senior credit facility were reduced to million annually  with principal payments on term note a due in quarterly installments of million beginning march  additionally  the amount available under the revolving credit facility was reduced from million to million 
proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction  along with proceeds from the february sale of certain assets  were used to reduce term note a from million to million and pay term note b in full 
the remaining proceeds were used to reduce the balance of the company s revolving credit facility by approximately million 
on september   we entered into a revised financing agreement with the lenders of our senior credit facility and an amended agreement with holders of the senior subordinated notes 
under the terms of the agreements  the company increased the amount of its senior term loan from million to million and decreased the annual principal payments from million to million 
the proceeds of million from the revision of the senior term loan were used to pay down the revolving credit facility to million 
changes to certain provisions in the borrowing base calculation of the senior credit facility were made to increase the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility by million 
the maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility was increased from million to million between february and may of each year 
the company incurred million in additional financing costs to complete these transactions which were capitalized and will be amortized over the life of the respective loans 
under the amended agreement  the term of the senior credit facility was extended by one year to september and the interest rates were reduced by 
the company s obligations at december  under various long term debt arrangements  including the sale leaseback transaction accounted for as a financing obligation  operating leases and other arrangements are summarized in the following table scheduled contractual obligations total after years term note senior subordinated notes financing lease obligation operating leases other notes 
table of contents at december  the company had a contingent liability for standby letters of credit totaling million that are issued and outstanding 
these letters of credit guarantee payment to third parties in the event the company is unable to pay in a timely manner 
standby letters of credit reduce the funds available under the revolving credit facility 
no amounts were drawn on these letters of credit as of december  our senior credit facility includes a revolving credit facility with an availability of million  increasing to million between february and may of each year  through september cash provided by operating activities was  in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
in addition to net income of million  the primary sources of cash in were non cash expenses of million and a federal tax refund of million  offset by million of increases in working capital needs 
working capital increased million from the prior year to million in investing activities provided million in and used million and million in and  respectively 
in  we sold our hillsboro manufacturing facility and certain equipment for million  which was partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
the primary use of cash in and was capital improvements  including the purchase of a manufacturing facility and related equipment in phoenix  arizona 
fiscal capital expenditures of million were held to minimum required levels and are not representative of our annual requirements 
fiscal capital expenditures of million reflect a spending program more consistent with our recurring replacement needs 
financing activities used million in in addition to the previously discussed revisions to our senior credit facility  we entered into a sale leaseback transaction  which generated million in proceeds 
the proceeds were used to reduce the term debt by million 
the remaining proceeds of approximately million were used to pay down the revolving credit facility 
financing activities used cash of million and million in and  respectively 
in  million provided from the revolving credit facility and million provided from operating activities was used to repay million in long term debt and fund the repurchase of approximately million of our common stock 
as described above  the company entered into a sale leaseback transaction agreement on february  for certain manufacturing facilities and the eugene office building 
as a result of the sale leaseback transaction  a financing lease obligation of million  net of a debt discount of million  was recorded based on the collective estimated fair value of the financing lease obligation and warrant on the date issued 
no gain or loss was recognized on the transaction 
the financing lease obligation  which expires in september  requires an annual lease payment of million  including interest at a rate of 
the financing lease includes certain financial covenants and requires the company to maintain an irrevocable letter of credit equal to one year s lease payments 
the company has a purchase option at the end of the lease term at an amount equal to the greater of the fair market value of the leased assets or million 
if the purchase option is not exercised and the company does not terminate the lease  the lease will automatically renew for a term of years 
we had commitments for capital expenditures of million at december   which we intend to fund from our revolving credit facility 
we announced a restructuring plan on july  to align our operations with market conditions 
the restructuring plan included an reduction to our workforce  permanently closing our hillsboro manufacturing facility  temporarily closing our phoenix  arizona facility  and initiating focused cost reduction programs across the company 
by december   we paid out approximately million in severance payments to employees  with a remaining balance owing of million to be paid in contracts extending through april we believe the restructuring plan will provide us with annual cost savings in excess of million  the majority of which will occur in reduced manufacturing costs 
see future outlook and risks to our business 
on august   we completed the acquisition of a  square foot pvc pipe manufacturing facility in phoenix  arizona and certain related production equipment located in the facility from uponor eti company uponor 
as part of our restructuring plan discussed in the preceding paragraph  we temporarily ceased operations at the phoenix facility and are maintaining the plant in an idled status 
we have long been active in the phoenix market  servicing it primarily from our facilities in southern california 
the acquisition of this facility will enable us to better serve our customers throughout the southwest 
while the production volume for of million pounds was only of plan  we expect production from the phoenix facility will grow to approximately million pounds as market conditions warrant to match that of our other facilities after completion of planned capital improvements 
total capital expenditures  including the purchase price  as well as the procurement of additional equipment are expected to total million upon completion of the facility  of which million had been incurred through 
table of contents december  we intend to fund this expansion from operating profits  and if needed  from our revolving credit facility 
on may   we received a million settlement payment for lost profits or business related economic harm from an action brought by us against certain responsible parties 
this action was associated with environmental contamination to our tacoma  washington property that resulted from releases occurring on adjacent property not owned by us 
this property was acquired as part of our september  acquisition of pwpipe 
approximately million of the settlement payment was  for financial reporting purposes  recorded as a retroactive reduction to the september  acquisition price of pwpipe since this represented the resolution of a preacquisition matter 
the balance of the payment was netted against litigation costs incurred in fiscal we are not a party to proposed clean up plans currently being structured between the state of washington and the responsible parties 
recent acquisition on march   we acquired the acquisition all of the stock of uponor eti company  a subsidiary of uponor oyj  a finnish company 
in connection with the acquisition  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary 
we merged the wholly owned subsidiary into uponor which changed its name to extrusion technologies  inc eti is a technology based manufacturer of polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe primarily for municipal engineering applications 
eti utilizes proprietary processes or designs which result in superior strength to weight characteristics relative to competitive products 
in addition to its pvc pipe products  eti also manufactures plastic water meter boxes for residential and commercial applications through its wholly owned subsidiary  mid states plastics  inc eti operates production facilities in texas  west virginia  missouri and kentucky  from operating headquarters in denver  colorado 
the acquisition of eti allows for differentiation of products in a competitive commodity business and expands the geographic markets served by the company 
the purchase price for eti was approximately million  of which million was paid at closing 
a working capital adjustment reduced the purchase price by approximately million 
also  included in the purchase price are transaction costs of million and royalties to be paid by eti of to million over the next eight years  based on the sales of specific products 
the acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase business combination but has not been included in the statement of earnings as the acquisition took place after the end of fiscal the initial purchase price will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their preliminary estimated fair values  comprised of net current assets of million  property  plant and equipment of million  various intangible assets totaling million and net deferred tax liabilities of million 
the acquisition was financed by an equity contribution from pw eagle to eti of million  drawn from pw eagle s revolving credit facility  a new million term note drawn under eti s new financing facility and a million advance drawn from eti s new revolving credit facility 
eti will be operated as a stand alone wholly owned subsidiary of pw eagle  with each entity responsible for its own debts and obligations without any guarantees or cross defaults 
in connection with the acquisition  eti entered into a senior credit facility consisting of i a revolving credit facility of million less the outstanding balance on the eti term note and the eti equipment notes ii a million term note and iii potential equipment notes of up to million 
the eti revolving credit facility bears an interest rate of libor plus 
eti is required to pay a fee of 
on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
principal payments on the eti term note are due in quarterly payments of  beginning on june  until it is paid in full on august  the term note bears an interest rate of libor plus 
additional payments on the term note will be made annually commencing december  for a cumulative total of million from excess cash flow  defined as ebitda net income plus interest  income taxes  depreciation  and amortization minus non financed capital expenditures  cash taxes  scheduled principal payments and cash interest 
payments on the eti equipment notes will be made monthly at th of 
table of contents the total note balance until paid in full on august  the equipment notes bear an interest rate of libor plus 
as of the date of acquisition  there are no outstanding equipment notes 
under this eti senior credit facility  eti is required to comply with certain restrictive financial ratios and covenants relating to minimum fixed charge coverage  minimum interest coverage  funded debt to ebitda  and maximum capital expenditures as well as other customary covenants  representations  warranties  and funding conditions 
eti is also required under the covenants to enter into a fixed rate agreement by april  with a minimum notional amount of  the eti senior credit facility is collateralized by nearly all of the assets of eti 
in addition  pw eagle amended its financing agreement with jp morgan partners  llc  among other parties collectively  the lenders  to acknowledge and reflect the purchase of eti 
in connection with this amendment  pw eagle issued to the lenders year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of pw eagle common stock for per share 
the warrants become exercisable on october  however  exercise is subject to the occurrence of certain events associated with a change in control of the company  as defined  that may either delay exercise or effectively cancel the warrants 
the warrants expire march  unless earlier terminated 
future outlook and risks to our business the statements contained in this section and statements contained in items   and a of this report on form k and the president s letter to shareholders in connection with our annual meeting of shareholders regarding our beliefs and expectations that are not strictly historical are forward looking statements made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements reflect our current expectations and beliefs as of march  and are based on information known to us and our assumptions as of that date 
these forward looking statements involve known and unknown business risks and risks that we cannot control 
as a result  our statements may not come true and our operating results may differ materially from our stated expectations and beliefs 
some of our current beliefs and expectations are discussed below along with risk factors that impact our industry and business 
forward looking statements we believe the gross domestic product gdp is closely correlated to the demand for pvc resin and pvc pipe and we recognize that our business is tied to economic cycles 
gdp increased by in  a significant improvement over the increase in because pvc producers and pipe producers began with low finished goods inventories and gdp has improved  we believe the demand for pvc pipe and pvc resin was greater than supply during the first half of the year 
we also believe that some of the demand for pvc pipe during the second quarter was the result of our customers increasing their inventory levels 
distributors began to decrease inventories during the second half of the year in anticipation of lower prices 
however  in the second half of the fourth quarter pvc resin producers announced price increases for january  and pipe producers announced pipe price increases to reflect these increased raw material costs 
as a result  distributors increased their purchases over normal seasonal levels during the second half of the fourth quarter 
in spite of increased purchases by distributors in the latter part of  we believe inventory levels of pvc pipe and pvc resin were relatively low at the end of  making it likely that the demand for pvc pipe and pvc resin will be greater than supply during the first half of  providing there is moderate growth in the economy 
in addition  the production of pvc may be limited by the availability of chlorine  a major raw material component of pvc resin 
chlorine capacity could be limited due to the closure of several chlorine manufacturing plants  and  to our knowledge  no significant capacity has been added 
this combination of industry conditions could lead to increased product pricing and increased margins in demand for pvc resin was strong in the first half of and pvc resin producers implemented increases totaling fourteen cents per pound during the first seven months of the year 
pipe producers implemented several pipe price increases during the same period in response to these resin price increases 
during the final four months of  pvc resin prices decreased by three cents per pound in response to a weakening demand for pvc resin 
during the same four months  pvc pipe prices decreased at a greater rate than pvc resin prices 

table of contents in response to increasing demand and relatively fixed current production capacity  pipe producers have implemented and announced several pipe price increases in response to resin price increases announced for the first four months of we believe these pipe price increases will have a positive impact on our margins 
over time  we expect the demand for plastic pipe to grow as acceptance of plastic pipe over metal pipe continues and the overall economy continues to grow 
industry growth projections call for annual sales growth rates for plastic pipe of three percent or greater in the actual growth rate may be less than or greater than three percent based on short term economic conditions 
we have historically been  and expect in the future to be  able to grow at rates in excess of the industry average annual growth rate  due to our emphasis on customer satisfaction and product quality 
our strategy has been  and continues to be  to concentrate growth initiatives in higher profit products and geographic regions 
in response to the reduction in the price of pvc resin and demand for our products in  we implemented operational and financial restructuring plans 
in july of  we announced an operational restructuring plan in response to the existing unfavorable pvc resin and pvc pipe price and poor economic conditions 
we permanently closed and sold the hillsboro  oregon production facility  and temporarily suspended operations of the phoenix  arizona manufacturing facility until customer demand requires additional capacity 
in the first quarter of  we decreased our operating expenses  eliminating non essential costs  and increased our production efficiencies 
we also successfully completed our financial restructuring plan 
elements of the plan included a million real estate sale leaseback financing transaction  the sale of our hillsboro  oregon facility and certain equipment for approximately million and the revision of our lending agreements 
we believe that the operational restructuring we completed in and the financial restructuring we completed in february and september have positioned the company for continued viability and future success 
we believe that these restructurings will allow us to meet our fixed charges even if the unfavorable economic conditions that we faced in return 
risk factors the pipe industry and our business are heavily dependent on the price and trend of pvc resin  our main raw material 
our gross margin percentage is sensitive to pvc and pe raw material resin prices and the demand for pvc and pe pipe 
historically  when resin prices are rising or stable  our margins and sales volume have been higher 
conversely  when resin prices are falling  our sales volumes and margins have been lower 
during the first seven months of  pvc resin producers implemented pvc price increases totaling fourteen cents per pound 
during the last four months of  pvc prices decreased by three cents per pound due to a decrease in demand for pvc 
in response to increasing demand and relatively fixed current production capacity  pvc resin producers implemented a two cent per pound price increase for january and a two cent per pound price increase for february in addition  price increases of two cents per pound in march and four cents per pound in april have been announced 
our gross margin decreases when the supply of pvc resin and pvc pipe is greater than demand 
conversely  our gross margins improve when pvc resin and pvc pipe are in short supply 
in april a major producer of pvc resin filed for bankruptcy and  during the first quarter of ceased operations at two manufacturing facilities 
this resulted in a reduction of approximately one billion pounds of production capacity  or of the north american industry capacity 
although these two facilities have subsequently been purchased by two pvc producers  we do not expect this idled capacity to re start in in addition  we believe the production of pvc resin may be limited by the availability of chlorine  a major raw material component 

table of contents the demand for our products is directly affected by the growth and contraction of the gross domestic product and economic conditions 
due to the commodity nature of pvc resin and pvc pipe and the dynamic supply and demand factors worldwide  historically the markets for both pvc resin and pvc pipe have been very cyclical with significant fluctuations in prices and gross margins 
generally  after a period of rising or stable prices  capacity has increased to exceed demand with a resulting decrease in prices and gross margins 
over the last ten years  there have been consolidations in both markets  particularly with respect to pvc resin manufacturers 
during the same period  the capacity of pvc resin producers has increased from just over billion pounds to over billion pounds today 
published pvc resin prices have fluctuated from a low of approximately 
per pound in to a high of almost 
per pound in to a low of approximately 
per pound in to a high of approximately 
per pound in  to a low of approximately 
per pound at the end of to its current level of approximately 
per pound in february while we expect the demand for pvc pipe to continue to increase over the long term  we also expect that the industry will continue to be subject to cyclical fluctuations and times when supply will exceed demand  driving prices and margins down 
these conditions could result from a general economic slowdown either domestically or elsewhere in the world or capacity increases in either the pvc resin or pvc pipe markets 
as a result of the size of both the pvc resin and pvc pipe markets  and the consolidation that has occurred in these industries  we believe that fluctuations from capacity increases are likely to be less extreme than they have been historically 
general economic conditions both in the united states and abroad will  however  continue to have a significant impact on our prices and gross margins 
we have a significant amount of outstanding debt and must continue to operate our business to meet our outstanding obligations 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding 
as a result  we must allocate a significant portion of cash resources  now and in the future  to pay the principal and interest on this debt 
during  we implemented financial restructurings to reduce our annual fixed charges 
while we believe these restructurings will allow us to meet our fixed charges even if the unfavorable economic conditions we faced in return  economic and market conditions could develop that cause us not to meet our fixed charges and default on our credit facilities 
in the event of a default  we will be required to either obtain a waiver from our lenders or amend our lending agreements 
there is no assurance that our lenders  note holders and lessors will waive any future default or agree to any future amendments of our credit facilities and leases 
if we failed to obtain a waiver or an amendment  we would be required to obtain new financing from alternative financial sources 
there is no assurance that we could obtain new financing  and if we did  there is no assurance that we could obtain terms as favorable as our current credit facilities 
interest rates effect our ability to finance our indebtedness and may adversely effect the demand for our products when higher rates slow the growth of our economy 
we financed our purchase of pwpipe in using a million senior credit facility and approximately million of senior subordinated notes 
on february   we completed a financial restructuring to reduce our floating interest rate term notes from million to million 
on september  we modified our financing agreement with the lenders of our senior credit facility 
changes to certain provisions of the senior credit facility were made to increase the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility by million 
the maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility was increased from to million between february and may of each year 
we increased the amount of the senior term loan from million to million 
we used these proceeds to pay down the revolving credit facility to million 
however  even with the revisions made to the senior credit facility and the senior subordinate notes  our ability to service our debt remains sensitive to an increase in interest rates 
interest rate increases would further challenge our ability to pay the interest expense on our debt and fixed charges 
see item a 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could slow the growth of the economy and affect the demand for our products 

table of contents other risk factors in addition to the risk factors discussed above  our business is also affected by the following i adverse weather conditions that result in a slow down in construction and the demand for our products  ii competition in the pvc resin and pipe industry that puts pressure on the price of pvc resin and the demand for pvc pipe  and iii net operating loss utilization 
for financial reporting purposes  the company s cumulative deferred tax asset recorded in prior years totaling approximately million associated with net operating loss carryforwards  has been fully utilized  including approximately million in the first half of we have evaluated tax reporting compliance relating to the past and fiscal utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards  and believe we have complied in all respects 
a failure to meet the requirements could result in a loss or limitation of the utilization of carryforwards  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the recorded values of certain assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management believes the company s critical accounting policies and areas that require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements include allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts necessary to maintain the allowance at a level estimated to be sufficient to absorb future losses due to accounts that are potentially uncollectible 
the allowance is based on our historical experience with prior year write offs  aging of past due accounts  financial condition of the customer and the general economic conditions of our market place 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions resulting in an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method and includes materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
judgment by management is required to determine both replacement cost and market 
we recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment in the fourth quarter of and reducing pipe inventory values by and million  respectively 
a change in this management estimate would impact cost of goods sold and the inventory carrying value 
property equipment and goodwill management periodically reviews its long lived and intangible assets and goodwill for impairment and assesses whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of that asset and its eventual disposition 
the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded  if any  is calculated by the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
management also periodically reassesses the estimated remaining useful lives of its long lived assets 
changes to either estimated future undiscounted cash flows or useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings 

table of contents accounting for income taxes significant judgment by management is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased  an expense within the tax provision is included in the statement of operations 
insurance liability we self insure our employees for health and dental related claims and record a claims liability based on claims history 
the liability is based on external analysis of our historical claim activity and reporting trends 
while management believes that the insurance liability is adequate at year end  results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 
worker s compensation liability we maintain an insurance liability for incurred and not paid and incurred but not reported employee related injuries 
the liability is based on external analysis of our historical claim activity and reporting trends 
while management believes that the worker s compensation liability is adequate at year end  results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 
warranty liability the provision for expenses related to product warranty is reviewed regularly 
warranty liabilities are estimated using historical information on the frequency and average cost of warranty claims 
management studies trends of warranty claims to improve pipe quality  pipe installation techniques and minimize future claims 
while management believes that the warranty liability is adequate at year end  results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard establishes new guidance on accounting for goodwill and intangible assets after a business combination is completed 
the standard discontinues the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  requiring instead the periodic testing of these assets for impairment 
goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  was million as of december  the company completed its transitional impairment testing during the second quarter of fiscal the policy for the periodic testing for impairment was finalized with the completion of the transitional testing 
no change was made to the carrying value of goodwill as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
or the annual testing completed in the third quarter of the effect of the change in accounting during the year ended december  was to increase net income by approximately  net of tax  or 
per diluted share 
the amounts shown below reflect the effect of retroactive application of the non amortization of goodwill as if the new method of accounting had been in effect in the prior periods 

table of contents in thousands  except per share amounts net income loss as reported effect of goodwill amortization as adjusted basic earnings per share as reported effect of goodwill amortization as adjusted diluted earnings per share as reported effect of goodwill amortization as adjusted there have been no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended december  there have been no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended december   other than the annual amortization of million 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations requiring the recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the carrying amount of the related long lived asset is correspondingly increased 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value and the related capitalized charge is depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  management believes the adoption of the provisions of this statement will not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
effective january   the company also adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement will require long lived assets to be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
this standard also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include disposals of assets below the segment level 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no
