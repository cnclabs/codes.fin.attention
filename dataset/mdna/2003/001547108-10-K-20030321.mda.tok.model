item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is set forth in item on january   ak steel entered into an asset purchase agreement with national steel corporation providing for the acquisition by ak steel of substantially all of national s assets 
national has been operating as a debtor in possession under chapter of the bankruptcy code since march  the purchase price specified in the agreement is  million  of which million is payable in cash and million consists of certain assumed liabilities  primarily operating leases for steelmaking equipment 
pursuant to the agreement  ak steel would not assume national s pension obligations or other postretirement employee benefit liabilities  consisting primarily of healthcare liabilities 
the agreement also contemplates the negotiation of a new contract with the united steelworkers of america  which represents most of national s hourly employees 
the agreement is subject to various contingencies  including approval of the bankruptcy court following a formal auction  currently scheduled for early april  at which competing bids could be submitted and considered in accordance with procedures established by the bankruptcy court 
additional information regarding the potential acquisition of national steel is set forth in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents customers ak steel s flat rolled carbon steel products are sold primarily to automotive manufacturers and to customers in the appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction markets  consisting principally of manufacturers of home appliances  heating  ventilation and air conditioning equipment and lighting products 
hot rolled  cold rolled  and coated carbon steel products are also sold to distributors  service centers and converters who may further process these products or resell them without further processing 
ak steel sells its stainless steel products primarily to customers in the automotive industry  as well as to manufacturers of food handling  chemical processing  pollution control and medical and health equipment 
electrical steels  which are iron silicon alloys with unique magnetic properties  are sold primarily to manufacturers of power transmission and distribution transformers  electrical motors and generators  and lighting ballasts 
in conducting its steel operations  ak steel s marketing efforts are principally directed toward those customers  such as automotive manufacturers  who require precise just in time delivery  technical support and the highest quality flat rolled steel 
management believes that ak steel s enhanced product quality and delivery capabilities  and its emphasis on customer technical support and product planning  are critical factors in its ability to serve this segment of the market 
the following table sets forth the percentage of the steel operations net sales attributable to various markets years ended december  automotive appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction distributors  service centers and converters the steel operations segment is a major supplier to the domestic automotive industry  including those foreign manufacturers with plants in the united states 
shipments to general motors  ak steel s largest customer  accounted for approximately  and of steel operations net sales in  and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of net sales for any of these years 
ak steel s relationship with general motors is solely that of a supplier in the ordinary course of business 
if general motors should elect to source more of its purchases of steel from other steel producers in the future  management believes that any material change in its purchases would need to be phased in over a multi year period 
management further believes that such a decrease in sales to general motors would be offset  to a material extent  by sales to new customers and increased sales to other existing customers 
if  however  these expectations prove incorrect  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
ak steel is a party to contracts with all of its major automotive and most appliance industry customers with terms that range from one to four years 
these contracts  which are typically finalized late in the year  set forth prices to be paid for each product category during each year of their term 
except for certain stainless steel agreements  which permit increased costs for nickel  chrome and molybdenum to be passed on to the customer  these contracts do not permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing market conditions or energy and raw material costs 
approximately of ak steel s sales of flat rolled steel products in were made to contract customers with the balance being made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale 
raw materials the principal raw materials required for ak steel s steel manufacturing operations are iron ore  coal  coke  electricity  natural gas  oxygen  chrome  nickel  silicon  molybdenum  zinc  limestone  carbon and stainless steel scrap  and other commodity materials 
in addition  ak steel routinely purchases between and of its carbon steel slab requirements from other steel producers  located primarily outside the united states  to supplement the production from its own steelmaking facilities 
most purchases of coal  iron ore and limestone  as 
table of contents well as transportation services  are made at negotiated prices under annual and multi year agreements 
purchases of carbon steel slabs  carbon and stainless steel scrap  natural gas and other raw materials are made at prevailing market prices  which are subject to price fluctuations in accordance with supply and demand 
ak steel may enter into financial instruments designated as hedges of the purchases of natural gas and certain raw materials  the prices of which may be subject to volatile fluctuations from year to year 
ak steel believes that adequate sources of supply exist for all of its raw material and energy requirements 
research and development ak steel conducts a broad range of research and development activities aimed at improving existing products and manufacturing processes and developing new products and processes 
research and development costs incurred in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
employees as of december   ak steel had approximately  employees 
approximately  employees at seven of ak steel s eleven plants are represented by international or independent labor unions  under various contracts that expire in the years through after a september  election  the national labor relations board certified the united auto workers uaw as the collective bargaining representative for production and maintenance employees at ak steel s plant in coshocton  ohio 
negotiations on a contract began on october  ak steel s mansfield works was one of the facilities owned and operated by armco prior to its merger with ak steel on september  on september   the contract between armco and the united steelworkers of america covering hourly workers at the mansfield works expired and the represented employees were locked out 
the lock out continued until the fourth quarter of while there is no new contract between ak steel and the union  in the first quarter of  ak steel began to call back represented employees on an orderly basis 
ak steel received notice on march   that the national labor relations board had certified the united auto workers as the collective bargaining representative for the salaried non exempt production workers at ak steel s plant in rockport  indiana  following a february  election 
no date has been set for commencement of negotiations on a collective bargaining agreement 
competition ak steel is one of the largest steel producers in north america 
ak steel competes with domestic and foreign flat rolled carbon  stainless and electrical steel producers both integrated steel mills and mini mills and producers of plastics  aluminum and other materials that can be used in lieu of flat rolled steels in manufactured products 
mini mills generally offer a narrower range of products than integrated steel mills but can have some competitive cost advantages as a result of their different production processes and non union work forces 
price  quality  on time delivery and customer service are the primary competitive factors and vary in relative importance according to the category of product and customer requirements 
domestic steel producers face significant competition from foreign producers who typically have lower labor costs 
in addition  many foreign steel producers are owned  controlled or subsidized by their governments and their decisions with respect to production and sales may be influenced more by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions 
imports of finished steel accounted for approximately of domestic steel market demand in  in and in these competitive factors  along with the cyclical nature of and intense competition within the industry  have resulted in downward pressure on steel prices and have caused dozens of steel companies to seek protection 
table of contents under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the last few years 
as a result  the industry has begun to consolidate  including the recent acquisition by international steel group of the assets of the former ltv corporation and its proposed acquisition of bethlehem steel s assets 
as previously mentioned  ak steel has entered into an agreement for the acquisition of the assets of national steel  which are also being sought by at least one other competing bidder 
these consolidating activities are expected to improve the competitive nature of the industry by creating larger  more cost competitive organizations 
in the first quarter of  the us government imposed temporary safeguard remedies on certain steel products that were the subject of u 
s 
international trade commission recommendations 
those remedies included a tariff rate quota on imported steel slabs  which are purchased by ak steel to supplement its own production  and tariffs on various imported finished steel products  some of which are sold in competition with products manufactured and sold by ak steel 
the remedies are scheduled to be phased out after three years via reductions in the tariffs and increases in the quotas during the second and third years 
environmental environmental matters domestic steel producers  including ak steel  are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
over the past three years  ak steel has expended the following for environmental related capital investments and environmental compliance costs years ended december  in millions environmental related capital investments environmental compliance costs except as expressly noted below  management does not anticipate any material impact on ak steel s recurring operating costs or future profitability as a result of its compliance with current environmental regulations 
moreover  because all domestic steel producers operate under the same set of federal environmental regulations  management believes that ak steel is not competitively disadvantaged by its need to comply with these regulations 
the company understands that the epa has completed preparation of the language for its final mact maximum achievable control technology rules for integrated iron and steel manufacturing facilities and intends to publish those final rules in the federal register in march pursuant to these rules  any existing affected source must have pollution control equipment necessary to comply with the mact rules installed and operating within three years after publication of the rules 
the company is in the process of planning and preparing for the timely installation of the necessary pollution control equipment to comply with the new mact rules 
the company anticipates that the three year cost  primarily capital investment  of such compliance will be a total of approximately million 
environmental remediation ak steel and its predecessors have been conducting steel manufacturing and related operations for more than years 
although their operating practices are believed to have been consistent with prevailing industry standards during this time  hazardous materials may have been released in the past at one or more operating sites  including sites that are no longer owned by ak steel 
potential remediation expenditures have been estimated for those sites where future remediation efforts are probable based on identified conditions  regulatory requirements or contractual obligations arising from the sale of a business 

table of contents pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  which governs the treatment  handling and disposal of hazardous waste  the united states environmental protection agency epa and authorized state environmental agencies may conduct inspections of rcra regulated facilities to identify areas where there have been releases of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents into the environment and may order the facilities to take corrective action to remediate such releases 
ak steel s major steelmaking facilities are subject to rcra inspections by environmental regulators 
while ak steel cannot predict the future actions of these regulators  the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities 
under authority conferred by the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  the epa and state environmental authorities have conducted site investigations at certain of ak steel s facilities  portions of which previously had been used for disposal of materials that are currently subject to regulation 
while the results of these investigations are still pending  ak steel could be directed to expend funds for remedial activities at the former disposal areas 
because of the uncertain status of these investigations  however  management cannot predict whether or when such expenditures might be required or their magnitude 
on july   ak steel received a special notice letter from the epa requesting that ak steel agree to conduct a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs and enter into an administrative order on consent pursuant to section of cercla regarding the former hamilton plant located in new miami  ohio 
the hamilton plant is no longer an operating steel mill  having ceased operations in  and all of its former structures have been demolished and removed 
while ak steel does not believe that a site wide ri fs is necessary or appropriate at this time  in april  ak steel entered into a mutually agreed upon administrative order on consent to perform such an investigation and study of the hamilton plant site 
the company has accrued the projected cost of the study at the hamilton plant of million and the study is projected to take approximately five years to complete 
environmental proceedings federal regulations promulgated pursuant to the clean water act impose categorical pretreatment limits on the concentrations of various constituents in coke plant wastewater prior to discharge into publicly owned treatment works potw 
due to concentrations of ammonia and phenol in excess of these limits in wastewater from the middletown works  ak steel  through the middletown potw  petitioned the epa for removal credits  a type of compliance exemption  based on the middletown potw s satisfactory treatment of the wastewater for ammonia and phenol 
the epa declined to review the petition on the grounds that it had not yet promulgated new sludge management rules 
ak steel thereupon sought and obtained from the united states district court for the southern district of ohio an injunction prohibiting the epa from instituting enforcement action against ak steel for noncompliance with the pretreatment limitations  pending the epa s promulgation of the applicable sludge management regulations 
management is unable to predict the outcome of this matter 
however  if the epa eventually refuses to grant the petition for removal credits  ak steel could incur additional costs to construct pretreatment facilities at the middletown works 
on february   the ohio environmental protection agency oepa issued a notice of violation with respect to the zanesville works alleging noncompliance with both a order and various state regulations regarding hazardous waste management 
ak steel is continuing to work with the oepa and the ohio attorney general s office to achieve final resolution of this matter 
in addition  on october   ak steel entered into an administrative consent order with the epa region pursuant to section of the rcra 
pursuant to this consensual order  ak steel agreed to investigate certain areas of the zanesville works 
ak steel and the epa are still discussing the scope of that investigation 
on june   the united states filed a complaint on behalf of the epa against ak steel in the us district court for the southern district of ohio the federal action for alleged violations of the clean 
table of contents air act  the clean water act and the rcra 
on the same date  ak steel filed a verified complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the court of common pleas for butler county  ohio the state action against the state of ohio and the oepa seeking a declaration that  among other things  a ak steel is in compliance with its operating permits for the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnaces at its middletown works  which would preclude the state of ohio and the oepa from taking any action to order or enforce obligations on ak steel with respect to those facilities  and b that any emissions from the middletown works do not cause  or otherwise contribute to  a public nuisance 
on june   the state of ohio moved to intervene in the federal action 
on august   the epa issued an order to ak steel pursuant of section of the rcra requiring it to investigate and remediate alleged polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in monroe ditch and dick s creek  which are located on and adjacent to the middletown works 
ak steel appealed the epa s order to the us district court for the southern district of ohio  where it was consolidated with the federal action 
on march   the us district court ruled that the state of ohio could conditionally intervene in the federal action 
subsequently  ohio filed a conditional complaint  which included various environmental claims  including seven air pollution claims 
on may   ak steel moved to dismiss all of ohio s claims in the federal action 
on july   the court of common pleas in the state action declared null and void two notices of violation issued by the oepa upon which certain of the air pollution claims of the epa and state of ohio in the federal action were predicated 
subsequently  the court held that that effectively concluded the state action 
ak steel appealed that holding to the th district court of appeals in butler county  ohio 
this appeal has been fully briefed 
ak steel is awaiting a decision from the th district court of appeals 
on october   the oepa issued purported final findings and orders ff os to ak steel containing allegations that were similar to those set forth in the two original notices of violation that had been declared null and void in the state action 
at the same time  the state of ohio moved to amend its conditional complaint in the federal action to withdraw four of its air pollution claims  which were predicated on the two original notices of violation that were declared null and void 
on september   the us district court dismissed with prejudice the epa s air pollution claim  which had been predicated on the two voided notices of violation letters 
in addition  on december   the us district court stayed the remaining three air pollution claims of the oepa in the federal action pending resolution of ak steel s related administrative appeal to the ohio environmental review appeals commission addressing the newly issued oepa ff os 
on january   the us district court granted ak steel s motion to dismiss as to six of the seven oepa air pollution claims  but denied ak steel s motion with regard to the oepa s remaining claims in the federal action 
on january   the us district court also denied ohio s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint to reassert certain air pollution claims against ak steel based upon the oepa s october   ff os 
also on january   the us district court allowed the sierra club and the national resources defense council to intervene in the federal action 
their complaint is virtually identical to the complaint filed by the united states on june  on january   the epa withdrew its administrative order issued to ak steel under section of the rcra regarding the investigation and remediation of alleged pcbs and pahs in monroe ditch and dick s creek 
discovery has commenced  but no trial date has yet been set in the federal action 
ak steel is vigorously contesting all of the remaining claims 
if the plaintiffs are ever completely successful in obtaining the relief they have sought in the federal action with respect to the air pollution claims  it could result in significant penalties and require a substantial capital investment to install interim pollution control equipment on the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnaces at the middletown works under current state pollution control regulations before certain proposed new federal regulations are made final 
once those proposed new federal regulations become final  ak steel could then be required to make another substantial capital investment to replace the interim pollution control equipment 
under those circumstances  ak steel may conclude that it is more cost effective to purchase slabs than to make them at the middletown works and may elect to shut down the hot end facilities of the middletown works 
if the epa and oepa are completely successful in obtaining the relief they seek in the federal action with respect to their water and or rcra claims  it could result in substantial penalties and an order requiring ak steel to investigate and remediate alleged pcbs and pahs in monroe ditch and dick s creek and or other alleged hazardous constituents at the middletown works 
at this time  ak steel is unable to estimate the cost of an adverse outcome related to the air pollution  water pollution or rcra claims or the potential cost of a shutdown of the hot end of the middletown works 

table of contents on september   armco received an order from the epa under section of rcra requiring it to develop a plan for investigation of eight areas of the mansfield works that allegedly could be sources of contamination 
a site investigation began in november and is continuing 
the company has accrued the projected cost of the study at the mansfield works of approximately million and the study is projected to take approximately five years to complete 
on june   the epa issued an emergency order pursuant to the safe drinking water act to ak steel s butler works located in butler  pennsylvania concerning discharge of nitrate nitrite compounds to the connoquenessing creek  an occasional water source for the borough of zelienople 
on march   ak steel entered in an agreed administrative order with the epa calling for  among other things  a decrease in the levels of nitrates and nitrites in the treated water discharged to waters of the commonwealth of pennsylvania by ak steel s butler works and for the provision of emergency drinking water for zelienople during certain times when it must draw drinking water from the connoquenessing creek 
ak steel has taken the measures necessary to comply with that order 
on september   ak steel entered into an agreed order with the commonwealth of kentucky for certain alleged air quality violations at its plant in ashland  kentucky 
this order required the adoption of certain corrective action plans and the payment of a  penalty 
ak steel has completed all requirements necessary to comply with that order 
on december   ak steel entered into an agreed order with the indiana department of environmental management for alleged violations concerning certain initial air emissions tests associated with the start up of rockport works 
this order requires the implementation of certain supplemental environmental projects and the payment of a  penalty 
the penalty has been paid and it is anticipated that the supplemental environmental projects will be completed in in addition to the foregoing matters  the company is or may be involved in proceedings with various regulatory authorities that may require the company to pay fines  comply with more rigorous standards or other requirements or incur capital and operating expenses for environmental compliance 
except to the limited extent noted above with respect to the claims in the federal action  management believes that the ultimate disposition of the foregoing proceedings will not have  individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

the complaint seeks various forms of declaratory  injunctive and unspecified monetary relief including back pay  front pay  lost benefits  lost seniority and punitive damages for the named plaintiffs and the other members of their alleged class 
ak steel has answered the complaint  moved to dismiss some of the claims and moved for summary judgment as to other claims 
the company continues to contest this matter vigorously 
on june   oral arguments were presented on the objections to the special master s recommendations in the case of ak steel corporation v 
sollac  sa  et al  case nos 
c   united states district court for the southern district of ohio the patent case 
the patent case involves issues of infringement  validity and enforceability of six us patents owned by ak steel that relate to aluminized stainless steel 
ak steel is seeking injunctive relief and monetary damages for infringement of the aluminized stainless steel patents 
the special master recommended that the court find certain claims of the patents were 
table of contents valid and that the defendants did not infringe upon these valid claims 
the special master also recommended that certain claims of the patents were not valid for lack of enablement 
on july   the trial court adopted the special master s recommendations in the patent case

t  federal court of canada the canadian case 
the canadian case presents issues of infringement  validity and disparagement related to three canadian patents owned by ak steel 
the plaintiffs in the us case allege that ak steel has unlawfully monopolized the aluminized stainless steel market 
discovery is underway and trial is currently scheduled to begin on january  in the us case 
no trial date yet has been set in the other cases 
the company continues to vigorously contest all of these claims 
in april  a class action was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio by bernard fidel and others against ak steel holding corporation and certain of its directors and officers  alleging material misstatements and omissions in the company s public disclosure about its business and operations 
on september   the court issued a ruling denying a motion the company had filed to dismiss the action 
discovery has commenced and trial currently is scheduled to commence in march the company is contesting this matter vigorously 
as of december   the company is named as a defendant in approximately lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos 
the majority of these suits have been filed in texas on behalf of people who claim to have been exposed while visiting the premises of a former armco facility in houston that has been closed since most of these lawsuits do not include a specific dollar claim for damages and many include a number of plaintiffs and multiple defendants 
specific dollar claims for damages have been asserted in only cases  involving over  named defendants in addition to the company and a total of plaintiffs 
a total of cases involve claims of  or less  cases involve claims between  and million  cases involve claims of million  two cases involve claims of million and one case sets forth a claim of million 
in all but four cases  each involving a claim of less than  the amount claimed is for compensatory damages and a separate claim in an equal amount is asserted for punitive damages 
most claimants fail to allocate their alleged claims of liability among the various named defendants 
it has been the company s experience  however  that  as a result of discovery  only a small percentage of claimants ultimately identify ak steel as a defendant from whom they are actually seeking damages and most of these claims ultimately are either dismissed or settled for a small fraction of the damages initially claimed 
for example  during  the company disposed of claims either through dismissal or settlement  with total settlement payments of approximately  during  the company disposed of claims with total settlement payments of less than  since the beginning of  the company has disposed of a total of claims with total settlement payments of approximately million and has not experienced a significant increase in the cost of settlement during this period 
in addition  only one case against ak steel has ever proceeded to trial and that case concluded with a verdict for the defense 
the company intends to continue its practice of vigorously defending these cases 
based upon its present knowledge  and the factors set forth above  the company believes it is unlikely that the resolution of these claims in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
however  predictions as to the outcome of pending litigation  particularly claims alleging asbestos exposure  are subject to substantial uncertainties 
these uncertainties include the significantly variable rate at which new claims may be filed  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies currently or historically defending asbestos claims  the uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  the type and severity of the disease alleged to be suffered by each claimant  and the potential for enactment of legislation affecting asbestos litigation

dollars in millions  except per share and per ton amounts operations overview ak steel s steel operations consist of seven steelmaking and finishing plants that produce flat rolled carbon steels  including premium quality coated  cold rolled and hot rolled products  and specialty stainless and electrical steels that are sold in slab  hot band  sheet and strip 
these products are sold primarily to the domestic automotive  appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction markets  as well as to distributors  service centers and converters 
steel operations also include ak tube  llc  which further finishes flat rolled steel into welded steel tubing  and european trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products 
the snow and ice control products segment consists of the operations of douglas dynamics  llc  the largest north american manufacturer of snowplows and salt and sand spreaders for four wheel drive light trucks 
the company s other operations consist of greens port industrial park on the houston  texas ship channel 
on april   the company completed the sale of sawhill tubular 
for all periods presented  the results of sawhill tubular are classified as discontinued operations 

table of contents compared to total steel shipments for the twelve months ended december  and were  tons and  tons  respectively 
steel shipments increased primarily due to record automotive shipments and  to a lesser extent  the addition of ak tube  which was acquired in the third quarter of value added products comprised over of total shipments  compared to approximately in shipments of hot rolled products increased in the second half of as the company took advantage of attractive spot market pricing for this commodity grade steel 
net sales in were  a nearly increase over the  reported in steel operations contributed  to total net sales in  compared to  in flat rolled sales per ton increased to per ton in compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of increased shipments to the automotive sector and higher spot market prices 
consolidated operating loss in totaled compared to a loss of in  while steel operations operating losses were in and in the following presents  on a pro forma basis  consolidated operating profit loss before and after unusual items  which are discussed below 
operating profit loss as reported pension and other postretirement benefit charge insurance settlement impairment of equity investment stock received in insurance demutualization operating profit loss  pro forma under its method of accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit plans  the company recognizes into its results of operations  as a fourth quarter adjustment  any unrecognized actuarial net gains or losses that exceed of the larger of projected benefit obligations or plan assets 
amounts inside this corridor are amortized over the average remaining service life of active plan participants 
actuarial net gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from any of the many assumptions used to value the benefit plans  or when the assumptions change  as they may each year when a valuation is performed 
in  the combination of a loss on pension plan assets compared to an assumed return  a decrease in the discount rate used to value projected plan obligations from to  to reflect declines in prevailing interest rates  and other actuarial losses resulted in a net actuarial loss in excess of the corridor 
as a result  the company recognized a non cash pre tax pension corridor charge of in addition  due to the decrease in the discount rate and rising healthcare costs  the company was required to recognize a non cash  pre tax corridor charge of related to its other postretirement benefit plans 
during  a investment loss on pension plan assets compared to an assumed return  and a percentage point decrease in the discount rate  required the recognition of a non cash pre tax pension corridor charge of in addition  because the decline in asset value in also caused the company s principal pension plans to be underfunded  the company recorded a non cash after tax reduction in equity of approximately based on current assumptions  no cash payments to the pension plans are expected until see liquidity and capital resources the operating loss included a pre tax benefit of arising from insurance settlements entered into by the company with certain of its insurance carriers  partially offset by an increase in environmental reserves 
including the benefit of this second quarter insurance settlement would result in a pro forma operating profit of or per shipped ton 
the settlement amount represented a negotiated dollar value the company accepted for reimbursement of past environmental and asbestos expenditures and  to a lesser extent  to release those insurance companies from a responsibility to reimburse the company for future covered expenditures under the policies 
other existing insurance policies covering asbestos and environmental contingencies may serve to mitigate future covered expenditures 
in addition  the company maintains reserves for future probable payments related to asbestos claim settlements and environmental investigation  monitoring and remediation  which do not consider the potential for insurance recoveries 
if these reserves are not adequate to cover future claims  then the company s financial position  operating results and cash flows may be negatively impacted 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a pre tax impairment of its investment in eveleth taconite mines llc evtac  a business the company accounts for using the equity method 
evtac  a company that produces iron ore pellets used in the production of steel  is a joint venture of ak steel  rouge steel and stelco 
the impairment  which reduces the carrying value of evtac to zero  resulted from the joint venture s loss of several major customers  including the company  which has elected to purchase most of its iron ore requirements from other suppliers 
in the fourth quarter of  anthem inc  the company s primary health insurance provider  converted from a mutual insurance company to a corporation  issuing shares of its common stock to certain of its long time policyholders 
as a major policyholder  ak steel received approximately million shares of anthem common stock as a result of this demutualization  recording an unusual pre tax benefit of the benefit was net of a liability established for the portion of the proceeds deemed to be healthcare plan assets 
in the first quarter of  the company liquidated all of these shares for total proceeds of  recording a non operating pre tax gain of excluding the unusual items described above  the decrease in pro forma operating profit from to was primarily due to higher costs  including in increased pension expense and in higher other postretirement benefit expense 
the increase in pension expense was primarily due to unfavorable investment returns in  lower asset balances and a decrease in the rate of expected returns from to 
the expected rates of return on plan assets reflect the company s belief that its fund managers can maintain long term earnings at least equal to these rates based on approximately equity and fixed income investment allocation 
the higher other postretirement benefit expense reflected an increase in current and future assumed healthcare trend rates 
operating costs in also included higher costs for scheduled blast furnace outages at the middletown and ashland works  and other planned and unplanned maintenance work and increasing scrap and purchased slab prices 
the higher costs in also resulted in a charge from an increase in lifo inventory reserves  including from liquidation of lifo layers 
in  declining costs resulted in a lifo credit of the increased costs were in large part offset by the benefits of higher shipment volumes  strong automotive shipments and higher spot market pricing 
overall contract pricing was lower in  but the company was able to negotiate some higher contract pricing that became effective at various times in the second half of the year 
cost savings were achieved through improved unit productivity and product quality  as well as reduced overtime and discretionary spending 
for the year ended december  and  snow and ice control products recorded operating profits of and on sales of and  respectively 
sales by the snow and ice control products business are strongly dependent on weather conditions in its market area and the level of light trucks sales 
the unfavorable variance in the year to year comparison is the result of lower shipments due to the very mild winter at the beginning of  partially offset by continued strong truck sales in the current year 
on april   the company completed the sale of its sawhill tubular division for approximately the company recorded a pre tax loss on the sale of after tax or per share in in the period from january through april  and for the full year  sawhill tubular generated after tax losses of and  respectively

table of contents the company s net loss in of  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share 
excluding the after tax effects of the unusual items  gain on the sale of anthem stock  loss from discontinued operations and extraordinary loss on the redemption of debt  the company s net of tax pro forma loss would have been  compared to a net of tax pro forma loss of in the comparative results reflected the current year s net increase in costs  including postretirement benefit expenses and maintenance costs  and lower profits at the snow and ice control products business  partially offset by improved shipments  pricing and productivity  and reduced spending 
compared to total steel shipments during declined to  tons from  tons shipped in although demand from automotive and appliance contract customers increased late in  shipments for virtually all product lines were equal to or lower than in due to severely depressed steel pricing  the company chose to forego some spot market sales during value added steel products represented of total shipments  compared to in  while commodity hot rolled product shipments declined to of total shipments in  compared to in during  net sales decreased to  from  reported for steel operations contributed  to total net sales in  compared to  in  a decrease of 
these declines were primarily due to lower prices in both the contract and spot markets  which were partially offset by a richer product and market mix 
approximately of ak steel s shipments of flat rolled steel products during were made pursuant to annual and multi year contracts  with the balance being made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale 
strong truck sales due to aggressive marketing by automotive companies  as well as higher snowfalls during the winter of contributed to snow and ice control products sales increasing to in from in the company recorded an operating loss in of  including an operating loss of in the steel operations 
both losses included the effects of two unusual items described above 
snow and ice control products posted an increase in operating profit to in from in  primarily due to the higher sales volumes 
excluding the pension charge and the insurance company demutualization benefit  the company would have recorded an operating profit of in compared to an operating profit of in the significant decrease in was primarily due to lower contract pricing and severely depressed spot market pricing  which lowered average selling prices by per ton  and the reduction in shipping volume  partially offset by company wide cost savings 
cost savings were derived primarily from lower market prices for purchased slabs and scrap  which saved over in  as well as overtime cost savings of approximately  partially offset by approximately in higher natural gas costs

the company recorded a net loss in of  or per share  compared to net income of  or per share  for excluding the two unusual items  net of tax  and the loss from discontinued operations  the company would have recorded a loss of in 
table of contents outlook the company expects its shipment volumes in to be about million tons  slightly lower than the amount shipped in while the company anticipates shipments to the automotive sector to be comparable to  demand and pricing in the spot market and demand for stainless and electrical steel products are beginning to weaken 
consistent with its long term strategy  value added products are expected to approximate of total shipments in  up from in notwithstanding anticipated lower spot market prices  the company s average selling prices for are expected to be approximately higher across all product lines compared to as a result of the improved product mix and higher contract pricing 
for the first time since the company recently negotiated higher contract prices with many of its contract customers 
the company expects its pension expense to increase in to  prior to any potential fourth quarter corridor adjustment 
the increased expense is primarily due to unfavorable investment returns on plan assets and a half percentage point reduction in assumed returns for however  based on current assumptions  no cash payments to the pension plans are expected until if actual experience differs from these assumptions  funding could be required as early as primarily due to rising medical costs and falling interest rates  other postretirement benefit expense is expected to be approximately  a increase over  excluding any potential fourth quarter corridor adjustment 
under the company s pension and other postretirement benefit accounting method  the annual determination of a fourth quarter gain or loss  if any  is made as of the plans measurement date 
since the balance of deferred actuarial losses for all major pension and other postretirement benefit plans was at or near the edge of the corridor at the end of  the development of any additional net actuarial losses  calculated in the fourth quarter of  would likely result in another corridor charge 
the amount and timing of required contributions to the pension trust depends on the investment performance of the pension funds and interest rate movements  among other things and  accordingly  the company cannot reasonably estimate the requirement at this time  but the amount could be substantial 
pension and other postretirement benefit expenses are dependent on numerous assumptions made annually 
use of different assumptions can have a material effect on the amount of annual expense recognized 
for example  one of the assumptions made in determining pension expense is the expected rate of return on plan assets 
a one percentage point decrease in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase the projected pension expense by approximately before tax 
one of the major assumptions made in determining other postretirement benefit expense is the assumed healthcare trend rate 
a one percentage point increase in this rate would increase projected other postretirement benefit expense by approximately before tax 
these estimates exclude any potential fourth quarter corridor charges 
the company expects overhead costs to rise approximately from levels  due primarily to the higher employee benefit costs described above and rising insurance costs  partially offset by continued cost containment efforts 
in addition  there continues to be significant volatility in energy markets  including natural gas  though the effect of normal market volatility on the company s natural gas costs is partially offset by its hedging strategies 
depreciation is expected to increase approximately  while interest expense should decline approximately due to overall debt reduction and the refinancing of of senior notes 
in the first quarter of  the company expects to ship approximately million tons  down from million tons shipped in the fourth quarter of due primarily to reduced demand from contract customers in the appliance  construction and manufacturing markets 
in addition  as a result of lower than expected spot market selling prices  the company chose to reduce its sales to non contract customers 
the company also has experienced a significant increase in natural gas prices  an unplanned blast furnace maintenance outage and higher prices for carbon scrap and foreign slabs  as well as the anticipated increased overhead costs and pension and other postretirement benefit expenses discussed above 
additionally  a seasonal decline in operating profit in the snow and ice control products segment of approximately is expected in the first quarter of as 
table of contents compared to the fourth quarter of as a result of these factors  the company expects to report both an operating loss and a net loss for the first quarter on january   ak steel entered into an asset purchase agreement with national steel corporation providing for the acquisition by ak steel of substantially all of national s assets 
national has been operating as a debtor in possession under chapter of the bankruptcy code since march  the purchase price specified in the agreement is  of which is payable in cash and consists of certain assumed liabilities  primarily operating leases for steelmaking equipment 
pursuant to the agreement  ak steel would not assume national s pension obligations or other postretirement employee benefit liabilities  consisting primarily of healthcare liabilities 
the agreement also contemplates the negotiation of a new contract with the united steelworkers of america  which represents most of national s hourly employees 
the agreement is subject to various contingencies  including approval of the bankruptcy court following a formal auction  currently scheduled for early april  at which competing bids could be submitted and considered in accordance with procedures established by the bankruptcy court 
the cash portion of the offer includes for national s working capital  which would be financed with a new credit facility that the company expects will utilize national s accounts receivables and inventories as collateral 
the company anticipates that the remaining cash would be derived from a combination of cash on hand and the issuance of debt 
the company has performed extensive due diligence and expects to realize in excess of of annual cost reductions and cost based synergies as a result of the acquisition 
these synergies consist of a combination of operating efficiencies  including productivity and product quality improvements  and reduced reliance on purchased foreign slabs 
this also includes the company s anticipation of significant overhead cost reductions and lower costs for labor and employee benefits 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had total liquidity  defined as cash  cash equivalents and availability under credit facilities  of on that date cash and cash equivalents totaled compared to of cash and cash equivalents at december  the company s primary source of cash is funds generated by operations and  as such  future operations could have a significant impact on the company s cash balances and liquidity

the company made a voluntary payment to its major pension plans during  however  its pension and other postretirement benefit expense exceeded total payments in the period by  excluding the fourth quarter corridor charge 
working capital utilized cash of during the period  including for accounts receivables  primarily resulting from higher steel sales in december compared to december the company also used of cash as a result of a reduction in accounts payable and other accrued current liabilities  primarily related to payments for slabs purchased in the fourth quarter of in preparation for a planned blast furnace outage at the middletown works early in the first quarter consumption of slabs during the maintenance outage and a reduction in raw materials were the primary drivers as inventory reductions generated of cash in the year

financial covenants the indentures and other instruments governing the company s senior indebtedness as well as its accounts receivable purchase facility contain restrictions and covenants that may limit the company s operating flexibility 
the senior note indentures impose restrictions regarding the amount of sale leaseback transactions  transactions by subsidiaries and with affiliates  use of proceeds from asset sales and some investments 
furthermore  the senior note indentures impose the following additional restrictions maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio of at least to failure to meet this covenant will limit the amount of additional debt the company can incur

table of contents capital investments the company anticipates capital investments of approximately  all of which are expected to be funded from available cash and cash generated from operations 
at december   commitments for future capital investments totaled approximately employee benefit obligations as of december   the company s pension plans were funded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  based on current assumptions  no cash payments to the pension plans are expected until if actual experience differs from these assumptions  funding could be required as early as the amount of any required payments made in that year or after would be subject to future market conditions leading up to the payments and could be substantial 
currently  the pension benefit obligation is  compared to pension trust assets of  at december   the company s liability for postretirement benefits other than pensions totaled  the company has established a healthcare trust as a means of prefunding a portion of this liability 
the balance in the trust  including the earnings on trust investments  as of december   was energy and raw material hedging the company enters into derivative transactions in the ordinary course of business to hedge the price of natural gas and certain raw materials 
on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december   current and noncurrent assets included and  respectively  and current and noncurrent liabilities included and  respectively  for the fair value of these derivatives 
changes in the prices paid for the related commodities are expected to offset the effect on cash of settling these amounts 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles permit choices among alternatives and require numerous estimates of financial matters 
the company believes the accounting principles chosen are appropriate under the circumstances  and that the estimates  judgments and assumptions involved in its financial reporting are reasonable 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership passes 
this is when the products are shipped per customers instructions  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
use of estimates accounting estimates are based on historical experience and information that is available to management about current events and actions the company may take in the future 
significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of long lived assets  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  environmental and legal liabilities  and assets and obligations related to employee benefit plans 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the potential that some customers may be unable to make payments 
while  based on the company s experience  losses due to credit failures have been low  if in the future the financial condition of some customers deteriorates affecting their ability to pay  additional allowances may be needed 
approximately of trade receivables outstanding at december  are due from businesses associated with the us automotive industry 
except in a few situations where the risk warrants it  collateral is not required on trade receivables  and while it believes its trade receivables will be collected  the company anticipates that in the event of default it would follow normal collection procedures 

table of contents the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in estimating levels of future taxable income  the company has considered historical results of operations in recent years and would  if necessary  consider the implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to generate future taxable income 
if future taxable income is less than the amount that has been assumed in determining the deferred tax asset  then an increase in the valuation reserve will be required  with a corresponding charge against income 
on the other hand  if future taxable income exceeds the level that has been assumed in calculating the deferred tax asset  the valuation reserve could be reduced  with a corresponding credit to income 
the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss  capital loss  and tax credit carryforwards as of the date of the merger with armco inc will be limited by section of the internal revenue code 
the company has recorded a valuation reserve for those carryforward amounts that are expected to expire prior to being used as a result of the limits imposed by section the company is involved in a number of environmental and legal proceedings 
accruals of probable costs have been made based on a combination of litigation and settlement strategies on a case by case basis and  where appropriate  are supplemented with incurred but not reported development reserves 
it is possible that results of operations in any future period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or by the effectiveness of these strategies 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans under its method of accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit plans  the company recognizes into income  as a fourth quarter adjustment  any unrecognized actuarial net gains or losses that exceed of the larger of projected benefit obligations or plan assets  defined as the corridor 
amounts inside this corridor are amortized over the average remaining service life of active plan participants 
this method results in faster recognition of actuarial net gains and losses than the minimum amortization method permitted by prevailing accounting standards and used by the vast majority of companies in the united states 
faster recognition limits the amounts by which balance sheet assets and liabilities differ from economic net assets or obligations related to the plans 
however  faster recognition under this method also results in the potential for highly volatile and difficult to forecast corridor adjustments  similar to those recognized in the past two years 
under the applicable accounting standards  actuarial net gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from any of the many assumptions used to value the benefit plans or when the assumptions change  as they may each year when a valuation is performed 
the usual major sources of actuarial gains and losses for pension plans are the differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used to value pension liabilities as of the measurement date 
for other postretirement benefit plans  differences in estimated versus actual healthcare costs  changes in assumed healthcare cost trend rates or a change in the difference between the discount rate and the healthcare trend rate are major sources of actuarial gains and losses 
in addition to the potential for corridor adjustments  these changes affect future quarterly net periodic benefit expense 
investments the company s financial statements consolidate the operations and accounts of the company and all subsidiaries in which the company has a controlling interest 
the company also has investments in associated companies that are accounted for under the equity method and  because the operations of these companies are integrated with the company s basic steelmaking operations  its proportionate share of their income loss is reflected in the company s cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company has a subordinated note receivable of due from  combined metals of chicago llc  one of these associated companies  which is recorded in other investments on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company has also provided a letter of credit to support a portion of that company s bank indebtedness proportionate to the company s investment in that company 
the company guarantees its proportionate share of the performance under an equipment lease that terminates in of ak isg steel coating company  another entity in which it holds an equity interest 
at december   the company s maximum liability under this guarantee was 
table of contents approximately  which was not recorded on its financial statements 
payment of any amounts under this guarantee  if necessary  would be made in monthly installments through early the company does not guarantee the debt of any other unconsolidated companies  has no off balance sheet debt and does not have any so called special purpose entities that are not included in its consolidated financial statements 
the company s investment in afsg holdings  inc represents the carrying value of its discontinued insurance and finance leasing businesses  which have been largely liquidated 
the activities of the remaining operating companies are in runoff mode and the group is accounted for as a discontinued operation under the liquidation basis of accounting  whereby future cash inflows and outflows are considered 
the company is under no obligation to support the operations or liabilities of this group 
financial instruments the company is a party to derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges under the financial accounting standards board s fasb s statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related pronouncements 
the company s objective in using such instruments is to protect its earnings and cash flows from fluctuations in the fair value of selected commodities and currencies 
for example  in the ordinary course of business  the company uses cash settled commodity price swaps  with a duration of up to three years  to hedge the price of a portion of its natural gas  nickel  aluminum and zinc requirements 
the company designates these swaps as cash flow hedges and the resulting changes in their fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income 
subsequent gains and losses are recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction 
as of december   currently valued outstanding commodity hedges would result in the reclassification into earnings of in net of tax gains within the next twelve months 
based on such reviews as it deems reasonable and appropriate  the company believes that all counterparties to its outstanding derivative instruments are entities with substantial credit worthiness 
goodwill at december   the company s assets included of goodwill 
each year  as required by statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performs an evaluation of goodwill to test this balance for possible impairment 
the evaluation requires that the reporting unit underlying the goodwill be measured at fair value and  if this value is less than the carrying value of the unit  a second test must be performed 
under the second test  the current fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the assets and liabilities of the unit including an amount for any implied goodwill 
if implied goodwill is less than the net carrying amount of goodwill  then the difference becomes the amount of the impairment that must be recorded in that year 
during  the company performed the required first test and determined that the fair value of its reporting units  which support its goodwill balance  exceed their carrying value and no further testing was required 
however  the company s businesses operate in highly cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate  which may lead to a required impairment charge in future operating costs 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
the company will adopt the statement in  but does not believe adoption will have a material effect on its financial statements

the company cautions readers that such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently expected by management 
in addition to those noted in the statements themselves  these factors include  but are not limited to  the following risks of continuing recessionary conditions in the general economy and in the cyclical steel industry  reduced domestic automotive production  changes in demand for the company s products  including the possible need to shift shipments to the spot market from the contract market  unanticipated plant outages  equipment failures or labor difficulties  actions by the company s domestic and foreign competitors  their employees and labor unions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company s market risk is limited to changes in a interest rates  b the prices of raw materials and energy sources  and c foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manages interest rate risk by issuing substantially all of its debt securities on a fixed rate basis 
the fair value of this debt as of december  is  million 
a reduction in prevailing interest rates of would result in an increase in the total fair value of the company s long term debt of approximately million 
the fair value was determined primarily from quoted prices 
the increase in total fair value due to an assumed decline in interest rates was calculated based on a change in the rate used to discount total future principal and interest payments 
an unfavorable effect on the company s results and cash flows from exposure to interest rate declines and a corresponding increase in the fair value of its debt would result only if the company elected to repurchase its outstanding debt securities at prevailing market prices 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in the price of certain commodities 
since approximately of ak steel s flat rolled steel sales in were made under long term contracts where selling prices generally cannot be adjusted in response to changes in the costs of raw materials and energy  a rise in the price of natural gas or other commodities is  for the most part  absorbed by the company rather than passed on to the customer 
natural gas prices  for example  have been volatile in recent years 
at normal consumption levels  a per million btu rise in natural gas prices would result in an approximately million decrease in annual pre tax operating results  excluding the effects of any then existing hedging instruments 
while such cost volatility increases the company s risk related to most commodities  in the case of stainless steel  increased costs for nickel  chrome and molybdenum can usually be recovered through price surcharges to customers 
the company uses cash settled commodity price swaps and or options to hedge the price of a portion of its natural gas  nickel  aluminum  and zinc requirements 
the company s hedging strategy is designed to protect it against normal volatility  however  abnormal price increases in any of these commodity markets could negatively impact operating costs 
gains and losses from the use of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss includes million in unrealized net of tax gains for the fair value of these derivative instruments 
the following table presents the negative effect on pre tax income in millions of dollars of a hypothetical change in 
table of contents the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december  due to an assumed and decrease in the market price of each of the indicated commodities 
commodity derivative decrease decrease natural gas nickel aluminum zinc because these instruments are structured and used as hedges  all of these hypothetical losses would be offset by the benefit of lower prices paid for the physical commodity used in the normal production cycle 
the company currently does not enter into contracts for trading purposes 
the company is also subject to risks of exchange rate fluctuations on a small portion of its receivables  which are denominated in foreign currencies 
forward currency contracts are used to manage exposures to certain of these currency price fluctuations 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency contracts with a total notional value of million for the sale of euros 
based on the contracts outstanding at the end of  a increase in the dollar to euro rate would result in a million pre tax loss in value  which would offset the income benefit of a more favorable translation rate
