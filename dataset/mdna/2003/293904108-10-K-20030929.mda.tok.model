on february   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with nps pharmaceuticals  inc nps 
on june   the merger agreement was terminated 
in accordance with the mutual termination agreement between the two companies  we received million shares of nps common stock 
the termination agreement imposes certain restrictions with respect to the transferability of the underlying shares by stipulating the maximum number of shares that can be transferred each month after the registration statement relating to the shares is declared effective 
considering such restrictions  million shares were valued at the fair value of nps stock on june  in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas of million and the balance of  shares were considered as restricted stock as defined under the scope exception provisions of sfas the restricted stock was valued at million by applying a discount on the related fair value based on a valuation performed by an independent third party consulting firm 
total consideration received aggregated million 
we also recorded million in costs incurred related to the proposed merger with nps primarily investment banking  legal and accounting fees 
the net gain of million was recorded as other income in the statement of operations for the year ended june in august  we entered into a zero cost protective collar arrangement with a financial institution to reduce the exposure associated with the million shares of nps common stock 
by entering into this equity collar arrangement and taking into consideration the underlying put and call option strike prices  terms are structured so that we have ensured that our investment in nps stock  when combined with the value of the equity collar  should secure ultimate cash proceeds in the range of of the market value per share of on the date the collar was entered into 
the collar is considered a derivative hedging instrument and as such  we will periodically measure its fair value and recognize the derivative as an asset or a liability 
the change in fair value will be recorded in other comprehensive income or in the statement of operations depending on its effectiveness 
when the underlying shares become unrestricted and freely tradable  we are required to deliver as posted collateral a corresponding number of shares of nps common stock with the financial institution 
the collar will mature in four separate three month intervals beginning november through august at which time we will receive the proceeds from the sale of the securities 
the amount due at each maturity date will be determined based on the market value of nps common stock on such maturity date 
the contract requires us to maintain a minimum cash balance of million and additional collateral up to million as defined under certain circumstances with the financial institution 
the strike prices of the put and call options are subject to certain adjustments in the event we receive a dividend from nps 
while we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investments will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future  we may seek additional financing  such as through future offerings of equity or debt securities or agreements with collaborators with respect to the development and commercialization of products  to fund future operations and potential acquisitions 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our operating leases  our convertible debt and our license agreements with collaborative partners 
as of june   we had million of convertible subordinated notes outstanding 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of 
interest is payable on january and july of each year beginning january  accrued interest on the notes was million as of june  which was paid on july  
the holders may convert all or a portion of the notes into common stock at any time on or before july  the notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events 
the notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness 
on or after july   we may redeem any or all of the notes at specified redemption prices  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the day preceding the redemption date

we have a multi year strategic collaboration with micromet ag  a private company to combine our patent estates and complementary expertise in single chain antibody sca technology to create a leading platform of therapeutic products based on antibody fragments 
we have an obligation to fund of research and development expenses for activities relating to sca for the collaboration through september we have a multi year strategic alliance with nektar whereby the companies have entered into a product developement agreement to jointly develop three products to be specified over time using nektar s enhance pulmonary delivery platform and seds supercritical fluids platform 
we have an obligation to fund most clinical developement and commercialization costs for the collaboration through january during january  we entered into a strategic alliance with skyepharma plc skyepharma based on a broad technology access agreement 
the two companies will draw on their combined drug delivery technology and expertise to jointly develop up to three products for future commercialization 
under the agreement we received a non refundable upfront technology access fee of million 
research and development costs related to the jointly developed products will be shared equally based on an agreed upon annual budget  and future revenues generated from the commercialization of jointly developed products will also be shared equally 
in addition  skyepharma is entitled to a million milestone payment for each product based on its own proprietary technology that enters phase ii clinical development 
effective december   we obtained an exclusive license for the right to sell  market and distribute skyepharma s depocyt product 
we paid a license fee of million for the north american rights to depocyt in january under the agreement we are required to purchase minimum levels of finished product for calendar of of the previous year sales by skyepharma and a sales level of million for each subsequent calendar year 
skyepharma is also entitled to a milestone payment of million if our sales of the product exceed a million annualized run rate for four consecutive quarters and an additional milestone payment of million if enzon s sales exceed an annualized run rate of million for four consecutive quarters 
we are also responsible for a million milestone payment if the product receives approval for all neoplastic meningitis prior to december  this milestone payment is incrementally reduced if the approval is received subsequent to december  to a minimum payment of million for an approval after december  during june we licensed the north american right to develop and commercialize atg fresenius s from fresenius biotech fresenius 
under the agreement we are required to pay fresenius two separate milestone payments of million each  the first payment upon fda approval of an investigational new drug application and the second at the submission of a biologics license application 
upon the commercialization of the product in north america  we will purchase the finished product from fresenius at a specified percentage of net sales 
contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
the following chart represents our contractual cash obligations aggregated by type as of june  in millions payments due by period contractual obligations and less than more than commercial commitments total year years years years long term debt including current portion operating lease obligations purchase obligations interest due on long term debt totals results of operations fiscal years ended june    and revenues 
total revenues for the year ended june  were million compared to million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  the components of revenues are net sales and certain contract manufacturing revenues  royalties we earn on the sale of our products by others and contract revenues 
net sales and manufacturing revenue increased by to million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  the increase in net sales was due to our commencing of sales of abelcet in north america in november and depocyt r in january  and increased sales of adagen r and oncaspar r 
during november  we acquired the north american rights and operational assets associated with the development  manufacture  sales and marketing for abelcet from elan 
during the year ended june   we recorded million of sales related to the abelcet product line  of which million related to sales of the product in north america and million related to the shipment of the product which we manufactured and sold to elan for the international market and other contract manufacturing revenue 
during december  we obtained an exclusive license for the right to sell  market and distribute skyepharma s depocyt 
during the year ended june   we recorded depocyt sales of million 
sales of oncaspar increased by to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  as a result of our reacquisition in june of the rights to market and distribute oncaspar in certain territories which we had previously licensed to aventis 
sales of adagen increased by for the year ended june  to million  as compared to million for the year ended june  due to an increase in the number of patients receiving the drug 
net sales increased by to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the increase was due to increased oncaspar sales due to the lifting during the prior year of all fda distribution and labeling restrictions that were in place for a portion of fiscal during the year ended june   the fda gave final approval to manufacturing changes which we made to correct certain manufacturing problems  and all previously imposed restrictions were lifted 
net sales of adagen were million for the year ended june  as compared to million in fiscal royalties for the year ended june  increased to million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the increased sales by schering plough  our marketing partner  of peg intron in combination with rebetol in the us and increased sales of peg intron in europe 
royalties for the year ended june  increased to million as compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to the commencement of sales of peg intron in combination with rebetol in the us and increased sales of peg intron in europe 
peg intron received marketing approval for use in combination with rebetol for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c in the european union in march and in the us in august schering plough launched peg intron as a combination therapy with rebetol in the us in october due to the competitive pressure from the launch of hoffman laroche s pegasys  a pegylated version of its interferon product roferon a in december  we believe royalties from sales of peg intron will decrease or remain flat for the first half of fiscal since its launch  pegasys has taken market share away from peg intron and the overall market for pegylated alpha interferon in the treatment of hepatitis c has not increased sufficiently so as to offset the effect the increasing pegasys sales have had on sales of peg intron 
as a result  quarterly sales of peg intron and the royalties we receive on those sales have flattened or declined in recent quarters 
we cannot assure you that pegasys will not continue to gain market share at the expense of peg intron which could result in lower peg intron sales and royalties to us 
based on our focused marketing efforts for abelcet we believe that we have been able to stabilize the pressure from the introduction of new products in the antifungal market and that the product is now back on a growth pattern 
we expect sales of depocyt  which are currently running at an annual rate of approximately million  to increase over the coming year 
we expect adagen and oncaspar sales to grow over the next year at similar levels as achieved during the previous twelve months 
however  we cannot assure you that any particular sales levels of abelcet  adagen  oncaspar  depocyt or peg intron will be achieved or maintained 
contract revenues for the year ended june  increased to  as compared to  the prior year 
the increase was related to revenue received from the licensing of our peg technology to skyepharma 
in connection with such licensing  we received a payment of million which is being recognized into income based on the term of the related agreement 
contract revenues for the year ended june  decreased by million to  as compared to million in the year ended june  the decrease was related primarily to a million milestone payment from our development partner schering plough which was earned to a result of the fda s approval of peg intron during the year ended june  we had export sales and royalties recognized on export sales of million for the year ended june   million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  of these amounts  sales in europe and royalties recognized on sales in europe  were million for the year ended june   million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  cost of sales and manufacturing revenue 
cost of sales and manufacturing revenue  as a percentage of net sales and manufacturing revenue  increased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  the increase was due to higher cost of sales for abelcet due to certain purchase accounting adjustments to the acquired inventory totaling million and as a result of unabsorbed capacity costs 
the increase was also due to our reacquisition of oncaspar  which resulted in increased cost of sales for the product 
under the reacquisition agreement  we made a million payment to aventis in june and we pay aventis a royalty on net sales of oncaspar 
the royalty and amortization of the million payment over a year period are included in cost of sales for the product  accounting for an increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales 
cost of sales and manufacturing revenue  as a percentage of sales  for the year ended june  was as compared to in this increase was due to lower cost of sales during the previous fiscal year as certain finished goods  which had previously been reserved for due to previously disclosed manufacturing problems related to oncaspar  were cleared and sold in fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million or to million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the same period last year 
the increase was due to increased spending of approximately million related to our single chain antibody sca collaboration with micromet ag and increased spending of approximately million on our peg camptothecin development program  offset by a reduction of approximately  due to our january decision to suspend its phase i peg paclitaxel program 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  increased by to million as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the clinical advancement and related clinical trial costs for peg camptothecin and peg paclitaxel and increased payroll and related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased by million to million as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to i increased sales and marketing expense of approximately million related to the abelcet acquisition and the sales force acquired from elan  ii increased sales and marketing expense of approximately million due to the reacquisition of marketing and distribution rights for oncaspar and establishment of an oncology sales force  and iii increased general and administrative personnel and related costs of approximately  these increases were partially offset by a reduction in legal expense of approximately million related to the settlement of the prior year s patent litigation with nektar 
during january  we settled our patent infringement suit with nektar and entered into a broad based technology collaboration 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased by million to million  as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to increased payroll and related expenditures for additional personnel and costs related to the identification and review of potential strategic alliances to gain access to technologies and products 
amortization 
amortization expense increased to million for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year as a result of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the abelcet acquisition during november and the depocyt license fee in january amortization of intangible assets is provided over their estimated lives ranging from years on a straight line basis 
write down of investment 
in january  we entered into a broad strategic alliance with nektar to co develop products utilizing both companies proprietary drug delivery platforms 
as a part of this agreement  we purchased million of newly issued nektar preferred convertible stock which is currently convertible into nektar common stock at a conversion price of per share 
under the cost method of accounting  investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value  distributions of earnings and additional investments 
as a result of the continued decline in the price of nektar s common stock  we determined during the three months ended december  that the decline in the value of its investment in nektar was other than temporary 
accordingly  we recorded a write down of the carrying value of its investment in nektar  which resulted in a non cash charge of million 
the adjustment was calculated based on an assessment of the fair value of the investment 
the estimated fair value of the nektar preferred stock was determined by multiplying the number of shares of common stock that would be received based on the conversion rate in place as of the date of the agreement  per share by the closing price of nektar common stock on december   less a discount to reflect the fact that the shares were not convertible as of december   the valuation date 
other income expense 
interest and dividend income decreased by million to million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in our interest bearing investments resulting from our purchase of the north american rights to abelcet in november for a cash payment of million  plus acquisition costs  as well as a decrease in interest rates 
interest expense remained unchanged from the prior year 
the majority of interest expense is related to million in convertible subordinated notes  which were outstanding for both periods 
in connection with the termination of the merger agreement with nps we received total consideration aggregating million 
we also recorded million in costs incurred related to the proposed merger with nps primarily investment banking  legal and accounting fees 
the net gain of million was recorded as other income in the statement of operations for the year ended june  other income expense decreased to  for the year ended june  as compared to million for the prior year  primarily due to a million payment received from nektar in the prior year in connection with the settlement of the patent infringement suit against nektar s subsidiary shearwater corporation  inc this one time payment was reimbursement for expenses we incurred in defending our branched peg patent 
other income expense decreased by million to million for the year ended june  interest and dividend income increased by million to million for the year ended june  as compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in interest income was attributable to an increase in interest bearing investments  primarily due to the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes during june interest expense increased to million from  for the prior year due to the issuance of the million in convertible subordinated notes in june other income increased to million for the year ended june  as compared to  in the prior year  primarily due to a million payment from nektar in connection with the settlement of the patent infringement suit against nektar s subsidiary shearwater corporation  inc this one time payment was reimbursement for expenses we incurred in defending our branched peg patent 
income taxes 
for the year ended june   we recognized net tax expense of approximately  certain tax expense  primarily related to the nps settlement in june  was offset by the reduction in the valuation allowance based on our net operating loss carryforwards expected to be utilized in the future 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the majority of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  and we therefore recognized million of net deferred tax assets 
of these assets  approximately million related to net operating losses from stock option exercises which  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  was recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital and not as a credit to income tax expense 
the remaining benefit from the reduction of the valuation allowance totaled million and was recorded as an income tax benefit in the statement of operations 
during the year ended june   we sold approximately million of our state net operating loss carryforwards for proceeds of  which was recorded as a tax benefit and we purchased approximately million of gross state net operating loss carryforwards for million 
we expect to record a effective tax rate in future years 
in fiscal  we had a net tax benefit of million 
we recognized a tax provision in fiscal which represents our anticipated alternative minimum tax liability based on our fiscal taxable income 
this tax provision was offset by the sale of a portion of our net operating losses to the state of new jersey 
we sold approximately million of our state net operating loss carry forwards for proceeds of  the fiscal tax provision benefit also included a reduction of a portion of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets based on future taxable income expected in fiscal for the year ended june   we recognized a tax provision which represented our anticipated alternative minimum tax liability based on our fiscal taxable income 
the tax provision was offset by the sale of a portion of our net operating losses to the state of new jersey 
during the year ended june   we sold approximately million of our state net operating loss carry forwards and recognized a tax benefit of  from this sale 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
all professional accounting standards effective as of june  have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
some of those estimates are subjective and complex  and  consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies have been highlighted as significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our consolidated financial statements 
revenues from product sales and manufacturing revenue are recognized at the time of shipment and a provision is made at that time for estimated future credits  chargebacks  sales discounts  rebates and returns 
these sales provision accruals are presented as a reduction of the accounts receivable balances 
we continually monitor the adequacy of the accruals by comparing the actual payments to the estimates used in establishing the accruals 
we ship product to customers primarily fob shipping point and utilizes the following criteria to determine appropriate revenue recognition pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  selling price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
royalties under our license agreements with third parties are recognized when earned through the sale of the product by the licensor 
we do not participate in the selling or marketing of products for which it receives royalties 
contract revenues are recorded as the earnings process is completed 
non refundable milestone payments that represent the completion of a separate earnings process are recognized as revenue when earned  upon the occurrence of contract specified events and when the milestone has substance 
non refundable payments received upon entering into license and other collaborative agreements where we have has continuing involvement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the estimated service period 
under the asset and liability method of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets is provided for when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have significant net deferred tax assets  primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards  and continue to analyze what level of the valuation allowance is needed 
we assess the carrying value of our cost method investments in accordance with sfas no 
and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
an impairment write down is recorded when a decline in the value of an investment is determined to be other than temporary 
these determinations involve a significant degree of judgment and are subject to change as facts and circumstances changes 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life acquired in a purchase business combination  are not subject to amortization  are tested at least annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value to its fair value 
recoverability of amortizable intangible assets is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flow to be generated by the asset 
the evaluations involve amounts that are based on management s best estimate and judgment 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
if recorded values are less than the fair values  no impairment is indicated 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimated useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
recently issued accounting standards in july  fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard supercedes the accounting guidance provided by emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
fas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
fas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  this adoption did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas requires an issuer to classify the following instruments as liabilities or assets in some circumstances mandatory redeemable financial instruments  obligations to repurchase the issuer s equity shares by transferring assets  and certain obligations to issue a variable number of its equity shares 
sfas is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise shall be effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we do not expect sfas to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
for a guarantee subject to fin  a guarantor is required to o measure and recognize the fair value of the guarantee at inception for many guarantees  fair value will be determined using a present value method  and o provide new disclosures regarding the nature of any guarantees  the maximum potential amount of future guarantee payments  the current carrying amount of the guarantee liability  and the nature of any recourse provisions or assets held as collateral that could be liquidated and allow the guarantor to recover all or a portion of its payments in the event guarantee payments are required 
the recognition and initial measurement provision was applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  fin does not have an impact on our financial position 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of apb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  at june  we were not a party to transactions contemplated under fin in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus opinion on eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the consensus provides that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met 
the consideration for the arrangement should be allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with different provisions if the fair value of all deliverables is not known or if the fair value is contingent on delivery of specified items or performance conditions 
applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for each separate unit of accounting 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  entities may elect to report the change as a cumulative effect adjustment in accordance with apb opinion  accounting changes 
risk factors our business is heavily dependent on the continued sale of peg intron and abelcet 
if revenues from either of these products fail to increase as anticipated or materially decline  our financial condition and results of operations will be materially harmed 
our results of operations are heavily dependent on the revenues derived from the sale and marketing of peg intron and abelcet 
under our agreement with schering plough  pursuant to which we applied our peg technology to develop a modified form of schering plough s intron a  we are receiving royalties on worldwide sales of peg intron 
during the fiscal year ended june   total royalties comprised approximately of our total revenues 
hoffmann la roche recently received fda and european union approval for pegasys  which competes with peg intron in the united states  europe and canada 
the launch of pegasys has led to greater competitive pressure on peg intron sales 
since its launch  pegasys has taken market share away from peg intron and the overall market for pegylated alpha interferon in the treatment of hepatitis c has not increased sufficiently so as to offset the effect the increasing pegasys sales have had on sales of peg intron 
as a result  quarterly sales of peg intron and the royalties we receive on those sales have flattened or declined in recent quarters 
we cannot assure you that pegasys will not continue to gain market share at the expense of peg intron which could result in lower peg intron sales and royalties to us 
schering plough is responsible for conducting and funding the clinical studies  obtaining regulatory approval and marketing the product worldwide on an exclusive basis 
schering plough received marketing authorization for peg intron and in peg intron and rebetol capsules as combination therapy for the treatment of hepatitis c in us and the european union 
if schering plough fails to effectively market peg intron or discontinues the marketing of peg intron for these indications  this would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even though the use of peg intron as a stand alone therapy and as combination therapy with rebetol has received fda approval  we cannot assure you that schering plough will be successful in marketing peg intron or that schering plough will not continue to market intron a  either as a stand alone product or in combination therapy with rebetol 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by schering plough to the marketing of peg intron is not within our control 
if schering plough breaches or terminates its agreement with us  the commercialization of peg intron could be slowed or blocked completely 
our revenues will be negatively affected if schering plough continues to market intron a in competition with peg intron or if it cannot meet the manufacturing demands of the market 
in  schering plough was unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of peg intron to meet market demand due to overwhelming demand for the peg intron and ribavirin combination therapy 
as a result  schering plough implemented a temporary wait list program for newly enrolled patients in order to ensure uninterrupted access for those patients already using peg intron 
as of october   the wait list was terminated as a sufficient quantity of peg intron and ribavirin was available to meet market demand 
if schering plough breaches the agreement  a dispute may arise between us 
a dispute would be both expensive and time consuming and may result in delays in the commercialization of peg intron  which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
abelcet accounts for million or approximately of our total revenues and we expect that abelcet will account for a significant portion of our future total revenues 
the entry of new products from merck and pfizer in the antifungal market is currently impacting abelcet sales  as clinicians explore the use of these new therapeutic agents 
in addition  fujisawa healthcare  inc and gilead pharmaceuticals are currently marketing ambisome  and intermune  inc is marketing amphotec  each of which is a liposomal version of amphotericin  for the treatment of fungal infections 
ambisome and amphotec compete with abelcet and sales of these competitive products have resulted in greater competitive pressure on abelcet sales 
we cannot assure you that revenues from the sale and marketing of abelcet will remain at or above current levels 
in addition  our manufacturing facility in indianapolis manufactures our entire supply of abelcet 
if sales of abelcet decline  if the indianapolis facility were to cease operations or if there were a long term supply interruption due to the facility s decreased production  our financial condition and results of operations will be materially harmed 
we may not sustain profitability 
prior to the fiscal year ended june   we had incurred substantial losses 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
although we earned a profit for the fiscal years ended june   and  we cannot assure you that we will be able to remain profitable 
our ability to remain profitable will depend primarily on schering plough s effective marketing of peg intron and our effective marketing of abelcet  as well as on the rate of growth in our other product sales or royalty revenue and on the level of our expenses 
our ability to achieve long term profitability will depend upon our or our licensees ability to obtain regulatory approvals for additional product candidates 
even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval  we cannot assure you that our products will achieve market acceptance or will be commercialized successfully or that our operations will sustain profitability 
we are subject to extensive regulation 
compliance with these regulations can be costly  time consuming and subject us to unanticipated delays in developing our products 
the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products in the united states and abroad are subject to stringent governmental regulation 
the sale of any of our products for use in humans in the united states will require the prior approval of the fda 
similar approvals by comparable agencies are required in most foreign countries 
the fda has established mandatory procedures and safety standards that apply to the clinical testing  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
obtaining fda approval for a new therapeutic product may take several years and involve substantial expenditures 
adagen was approved by the fda in oncaspar was approved in the united states and in germany in  and in canada in  in each case for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who are hypersensitive to native forms of l asparaginase 
oncaspar was approved in russia in april for therapeutic use in a broad range of cancers 
peg intron was approved in europe and the united states for the treatment of hepatitis c in may and january  respectively 
abelcet received us approval in november and canadian approval in september depocyt received us approval in april except for these approvals  none of our other products has been approved for sale and use in humans in the united states or elsewhere 
we cannot assure you that we or our licensees will be able to obtain fda or other relevant marketing approval for any of our other products 
in addition  any approved products are subject to continuing regulation 
if we or our licensees fail to comply with applicable requirements it could result in o criminal penalties  o civil penalties  o fines  o recall or seizure  o injunctions requiring suspension of production  o orders requiring ongoing supervision by the fda  or o refusal by the government to approve marketing or export applications or to allow us to enter into supply contracts 
if we or our licensees fail to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals or fail to obtain or maintain approvals of the scope requested  it will delay or preclude us or our licensees or marketing partners from marketing our products 
it could also limit the commercial use of our products 
any such failure or limitation may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have experienced problems complying with the fda s regulations for manufacturing our products  and have had to conduct voluntary recalls of certain of our products 
these problems could materially harm our business 
manufacturers of drugs also must comply with the applicable fda good manufacturing practice regulations  which include quality control and quality assurance requirements as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodic inspection by the fda and corresponding state agencies  including unannounced inspections  and must be licensed as part of the product approval process before they can be used in commercial manufacturing 
we or our present or future suppliers may be unable to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practice regulations and other fda regulatory requirements 
we manufacture abelcet  oncaspar and adagen 
schering plough is responsible for manufacturing peg intron and skyepharma is responsible for manufacturing depocyt 
adagen and oncaspar use our earlier peg technology which tends to be less stable than the peg technology used in peg intron and our products under development 
due  in part  to the drawbacks in the earlier technologies we have had and will likely continue to have potential manufacturing problems with these products 
manufacturing and stability problems required us to implement voluntarily recalls for one adagen batch in march and certain batches of oncaspar in june voluntary recalls may take place in the future 
mandatory recalls can also take place if regulators or courts require them  even if we believe our products are safe and effective 
recalls result in lost sales of the recalled products themselves  and can result in further lost sales while replacement products are manufactured 
we cannot assure you that a product recall will not materially adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations or our reputation and relationship with our customers 
during  we experienced manufacturing problems with oncaspar 
the problems were due to increased levels of white particulates in batches of oncaspar  which resulted in an increased rejection rate for this product 
in november  as a result of manufacturing changes we implemented  the fda withdrew this distribution restriction 
during this period we agreed with the fda to temporary labeling and distribution restrictions for oncaspar and instituted additional inspection and labeling procedures prior to distribution 
in july  the fda conducted an inspection of our manufacturing facility in connection with our product license for adagen 
following that inspection  the fda documented several deviations from current good manufacturing practices  known as cgmp  in a form report 
we provided the fda with a corrective action plan 
in november  the fda issued a warning letter citing the same cgmp deviations listed in the july form  but it also stated that the fda was satisfied with our proposed corrective actions 
as a result of the deviations  the fda decided not to approve product export requests from us for oncaspar until it determined that all noted cgmp deviations were either corrected or in the process of being corrected 
this restriction was removed in august since january  the fda has conducted follow up inspections as well as routine inspections of our manufacturing facilities related to abelcet  oncaspar and adagen 
following certain of these inspections  the fda issued eight form reports citing deviations from cgmp  the most recent one of which was issued in june we have or are in the process of responding to such reports with corrective action plans 
we are aware that the fda has conducted inspections of certain of the manufacturing facilities of schering plough  and those inspections have resulted in the issuance of form s citing deviations from cgmp 
if we or our licensees  including schering plough  face additional manufacturing problems in the future or if we or our licensees are unable to satisfactorily resolve current or future manufacturing problems  the fda could require us or our licensees to discontinue the distribution of our products or to delay continuation of clinical trials 
in addition  if we or our licensees  including schering plough  cannot market and distribute our products for an extended period  sales of the products will suffer  which would adversely affect our financial results 
our clinical trials could take longer to complete and cost more than we expect 
we will need to conduct significant additional clinical studies of all of our product candidates  which have not yet been approved for sale 
these studies are costly  time consuming and unpredictable 
any unanticipated costs or delays in our clinical studies could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a phase iii clinical trial is being conducted for peg intron for one cancer indication 
schering plough is also in early stage clinical trials for peg intron in other cancer indications 
schering plough is currently conducting late stage strategic clinical trials for treatment of hepatitis c in japan 
clinical trials are also being conducted for peg intron as a long term maintenance therapy the copilot study and separately as combination therapy with rebetol in patients with chronic hepatitis c who did not respond to or had relapsed following previous interferon based therapy 
we are currently conducting phase ii clinical trials for peg camptothecin and plan to initiate phase iii clinical trials for atg fresenius s during fiscal the rate of completion of clinical trials depends upon many factors  including the rate of enrollment of patients 
if we or the other sponsors of these clinical trials are unable to accrue sufficient clinical patients in such trials during the appropriate period  such trials may be delayed and will likely incur significant additional costs 
in addition  fda or institutional review boards may require us to delay  restrict  or discontinue our clinical trials on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the cost of human clinical trials varies dramatically based on a number of factors  including o the order and timing of clinical indications pursued  o the extent of development and financial support from corporate collaborators  o the number of patients required for enrollment  o the difficulty of obtaining clinical supplies of the product candidate  and o the difficulty in obtaining sufficient patient populations and clinicians 
all statutes and regulations governing the conduct of clinical trials are subject to change in the future  which could affect the cost of our clinical trials 
any unanticipated costs or delays in our clinical studies could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we rely on corporate collaborators or academic institutions to conduct some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our product candidates 
we will have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted them entirely on our own 
we cannot assure you that these trials will commence or be completed as we expect or that they will be conducted successfully 
if preclinical and clinical trials do not yield positive results  our product candidates will fail 
if preclinical and clinical testing of one or more of our product candidates does not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the desired indications  those potential products will fail 
numerous unforeseen events may arise during  or as a result of  the testing process  including the following o the results of preclinical studies may be inconclusive  or they may not be indicative of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials  o potential products may not have the desired effect or may have undesirable side effects or other characteristics that preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use if approved  o results attained in early human clinical trials may not be indicative of results that are obtained in later clinical trials  and o after reviewing test results  we or our strategic partners may abandon projects which we might previously have believed to be promising 
clinical testing is very costly and can take many years 
the failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic product under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval  which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
in june  we reported that schering plough completed its phase iii clinical trial  which compared peg intron to intron a in patients with newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia or cml 
in the study  although peg intron demonstrated clinical comparability and a comparable safety profile with intron a  the efficacy results for peg intron did not meet the protocol specified statistical criteria for non inferiority  the primary endpoint of the study 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for our products  they may not be accepted in the marketplace 
the commercial success of our products will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community and third party payors as clinically useful  cost effective and safe 
even if our products obtain regulatory approval  we cannot assure you that they will achieve market acceptance of any kind 
the degree of market acceptance will depend on many factors  including o the receipt  timing and scope of regulatory approvals  o the timing of market entry in comparison with potentially competitive products  o the availability of third party reimbursement  and o the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical safety  efficacy and cost effectiveness of drug candidates  as well as their advantages over existing technologies and therapeutics 
if any of our products do not achieve market acceptance  we will likely lose our entire investment in that product 
we depend on our collaborative partners 
if we lose our collaborative partners or they do not apply adequate resources to our collaborations  our product development and financial performance may suffer 
we rely heavily and will depend heavily in the future on collaborations with corporate partners  primarily pharmaceutical companies  for one or more of the research  development  manufacturing  marketing and other commercialization activities relating to many of our product candidates 
if we lose our collaborative partners  or if they do not apply adequate resources to our collaborations  our product development and financial performance may suffer 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by our collaborators to their collaborations with us is not within our control 
if any collaborator breaches or terminates its agreements with us  or fails to conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner  the commercialization of our product candidates could be slowed or blocked completely 
we cannot assure you that our collaborative partners will not change their strategic focus or pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by these collaborative programs 
our collaborators could develop competing products 
in addition  our revenues will be affected by the effectiveness of our corporate partners in marketing any successfully developed products 
we cannot assure you that our collaborations will be successful 
disputes may arise between us and our collaborators as to a variety of matters  including financing obligations under our agreements and ownership of intellectual property rights 
these disputes may be both expensive and time consuming and may result in delays in the development and commercialization of products 
we purchase some of the compounds utilized in our products from a single source or a limited group of suppliers  and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenues 
we purchase the unmodified compounds utilized in our approved products and products under development from outside suppliers 
we may be required to enter into supply contracts with outside suppliers for certain unmodified compounds 
for example  we have an agreement with hoffmann la roche diagnostics gmbh to produce the unmodified adenosine deaminase enzyme used in the manufacture of adagen and agreements with merck co  inc and kyowa hakko to produce the unmodified forms of l asparaginase used in the manufacture of oncaspar 
we have two suppliers that produce the amphotericin used in the manufacture of abelcet  bristol myers squibb and alpharma aps we have a supply agreement with bristol myers squibb 
if we experience a delay in obtaining or are unable to obtain any unmodified compound  including unmodified adenosine deaminase  unmodified l asparaginase or amphotericin  on reasonable terms  or at all  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are required to obtain an alternate source for an unmodified compound utilized in a product  the fda and relevant foreign regulatory agencies will likely require that we perform additional testing to demonstrate that the alternate material is biologically and chemically equivalent to the unmodified compound previously used in our clinical trials 
this testing could delay or stop development of a product  limit commercial sales of an approved product and cause us to incur significant additional expenses 
if we are unable to demonstrate that the alternate material is chemically and biologically equivalent to the previously used unmodified compound  we will likely be required to repeat some or all of the preclinical and clinical trials conducted for the compound 
the marketing of an fda approved drug could be disrupted while such tests are conducted 
even if the alternate material is shown to be chemically and biologically equivalent to the previously used compound  the fda or relevant foreign regulatory agency may require that we conduct additional clinical trials with the alternate material 
hoffmann la roche diagnostic gmbh is the only fda approved supplier of the adenosine deaminase enzyme  or ada  used in adagen 
during we obtained fda approval of the use of the ada enzyme obtained from bovine intestines from cattle of new zealand origin 
new zealand currently certifies that it s cattle are bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease free 
beginning in september  the united states department of agriculture usda required all animal sourced materials shipped to the united states from any european country to contain a veterinary certificate that the product is bse free  regardless of the country of origin 
our permit issued by the usda to import ada expired in march we currently have more than six months supply of ada enzyme in inventory and have applied for a new import permit from the usda 
we cannot guarantee that such import permit will be issued 
if the usda fails to issue a new import permit or if our sole supplier is unable or unwilling to continue supplying us with ada  it is likely that we will be unable to produce or distribute adagen once we utilize our current inventory of ada enzyme 
the united states and foreign patents upon which our original peg technology was based have expired 
we depend on patents and proprietary rights  which may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and the development by our competitors of competitive products 
research corporation technologies  inc held the patent upon which our original peg technology was based and had granted us a license under such patent 
research corporation s patent contained broad claims covering the attachment of peg to polypeptides 
however  this united states patent and its corresponding foreign patents expired in december based upon the expiration of the research corporation patent  other parties will be permitted to make  use or sell products covered by the claims of the research corporation patent  subject to other patents  including those which we hold 
we have obtained numerous patents with claims covering improved methods of attaching or linking peg to therapeutic compounds 
we cannot assure you that any of these patents will enable us to prevent infringement or that competitors will not develop alternative methods of attaching peg to compounds potentially resulting in competitive products outside the protection that may be afforded by our patents 
we are aware that others have also filed patent applications and have been granted patents in the united states and other countries with respect to the application of peg to proteins and other compounds 
however  other than hoffmann la roche s pegasys  we are unaware of any other pegylated products that compete with our pegylated products 
the expiration of the research corporation patent or other patents related to peg that have been granted to third parties may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to develop and maintain a strong patent position for our products and technologies both in the united states and in other countries 
we have been issued patents in the united states  many of which have foreign counterparts 
these patents  if extensions are not granted  are expected to expire beginning in through we have also filed and currently have pending patent applications in the united states 
under our license agreements  we have access to large portions of micromet s and nektar s patent estates as well as a small number of individually licensed patents 
of the patents owned or licensed by us  relate to peg intron  relate to abelcet  relate to peg camptothecin  and relate to depocyt 
although we believe that our patents provide certain protection from competition  we cannot assure you that such patents will be of substantial protection or commercial benefit to us  will afford us adequate protection from competing products  or will not be challenged or declared invalid 
in addition  we cannot assure you that additional united states patents or foreign patent equivalents will be issued to us 
the scope of patent claims for biotechnological inventions is uncertain  and our patents and patent applications are subject to this uncertainty 
to facilitate development of our proprietary technology base  we may need to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties 
if we are unable to obtain such licenses  our product development efforts may be delayed or blocked 
we are aware that certain organizations are engaging in activities that infringe certain of our peg and sca technology patents 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enforce our patent and other rights against such organizations 
we expect that there will continue to be significant litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries regarding patents and other proprietary rights 
we have become involved in patent litigation  and we may likely become involved in additional patent litigation in the future 
we may incur substantial costs in asserting any patent rights and in defending suits against us related to intellectual property rights 
such disputes could substantially delay our product development or commercialization activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also rely on trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advancements to protect our proprietary technology 
we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators 
however  these parties may not honor these agreements  and we may not be able to successfully protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets and know how 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others  which could increase our costs and negatively affect our profitability 
our success also depends on avoiding infringement of the proprietary technologies of others 
in particular  there may be certain issues patents and patent applications claiming subject matter which we or our collaborators may be required to license in order to research  develop or commercialize at least some of our products 
in addition  third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us 
an adverse outcome in these proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease or modify the use of our technology 
if we are required to license such technology  we cannot assure you that a license under such patents and patent applications will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
further  we may incur substantial costs defending ourselves in lawsuits against charges of patent infringement or other unlawful use of another s proprietary technology 
we have limited sales and marketing experience  which makes us dependent on our marketing partners 
we have historically had limited experience in sales  marketing or distribution 
in connection with our acquisition of abelcet business from elan in november  we acquired a person sales and marketing team 
in addition  we have recently acquired marketing rights to depocyt from skyepharma and reacquired the rights to market and distribute oncaspar in the united states and certain other countries in june prior to these acquisitions  adagen  which we market on a worldwide basis to a small patient population  was the only product for which we engaged in the direct commercial marketing  and therefore  we are significantly dependent on the abelcet sales and marketing team to promote abelcet 
we have provided exclusive marketing rights to schering plough for peg intron worldwide and to medac gmbh for oncaspar in most of europe and parts of asia 
we have an agreement with nova factor  inc formerly known as gentiva health services  inc to purchase and distribute adagen  oncaspar and depocyt in the united states and canada 
to the extent that we enter into licensing arrangements for the marketing and sale of our future products  we may not be able to enter into or maintain such arrangements on acceptable terms  if at all  and any revenues we receive will depend primarily on the efforts of these third parties 
we will not control the amount and timing of marketing resources that such third parties devote to our products 
in addition  to the extent that we market products directly  significant additional expenditures and management resources would be required to increase the size of our internal sales force 
in any sales or marketing effort  we would compete with many other companies that currently have extensive and well funded sales operations 
our marketing and sales efforts may be unable to compete successfully against other such companies 
we may acquire other companies or products and may be unable to successfully integrate such companies with our operations 
we may expand and diversify our operations with acquisitions 
if we are unsuccessful in integrating any such company with our operations  or if integration is more difficult than anticipated  we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from any acquisition include those associated with o unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired company  o conforming the acquired company s standards  processes  procedures and controls with our operations  o coordinating our new product and process development  o diversion of existing management relating to the integration and operation of the acquired company  o hiring additional management and other critical personnel  and o increasing the scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
we may need to obtain additional financing to meet our future capital needs  and this financing may not be available when we need it 
our current development projects require substantial capital 
we may require substantial additional funds to conduct research activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials and other activities relating to the successful commercialization of potential products 
in addition  we may seek to acquire additional products  technologies and companies  which could require substantial capital 
in addition  we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to obtain significant revenue from peg intron 
additional funds from other sources may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are unavailable from operations or additional sources of financing  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or one or more of our proposed acquisitions of technologies or companies which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operations 
while we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investments will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including o the level of revenues we receive from our fda approved products and product candidates  o continued progress of our research and development programs  o our ability to establish additional collaborative arrangements  o changes in our existing collaborative relationships  o progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  o the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory clearance for our products  o the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  o competing technological and market developments  and o our ability to market and distribute our products and establish new collaborative and licensing arrangements 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources which may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to o delay  reduce the scope or eliminate one or more of our development projects  o obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves  or o license rights to technologies  product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available 
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel  which would harm our business 
because of the specialized scientific nature of our business  we are highly dependent upon qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel  which include arthur j 
higgins  kenneth j 
zuerblis and ulrich grau  phd there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field 
therefore  we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
although we have employment agreements with mr 
higgins  mr 
zuerblis and dr 
grau  the loss of their services as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific  technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner  would harm our research and development programs and our business 
risks related to our industry we face rapid technological change and intense competition  which could harm our business and results of operations 
the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change 
our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances 
rapid technological development by others may result in our products and technologies becoming obsolete 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experiences and greater manufacturing  marketing and financial resources than we do 
accordingly  our competitors may develop technologies and products that are superior to those we or our collaborators are developing and render our technologies and products or those of our collaborators obsolete and noncompetitive 
in addition  many of our competitors have much more experience than we do in preclinical testing and human clinical trials of new drugs  as well as obtaining fda and other regulatory approval 
if we cannot compete effectively  our business and financial performance would suffer 
we face intense competition from established biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as academic and research institutions that are pursuing competing technologies and products 
we know that competitors are developing or manufacturing various products that are used for the prevention  diagnosis or treatment of diseases that we have targeted for product development 
for example  hoffmann la roche s pegasys has received fda and european union approval for treatment of hepatitis c as a monotherapy and in combination with ribavirin 
pegasys competes with peg intron in the united states and the european union and has led to greater competitive pressure on peg intron sales 
since its launch  pegasys has taken market share away from peg intron and the overall market for pegylated alpha interferon in the treatment of hepatitis c has not increased sufficiently so as offset the effect the increasing pegasys sales have had on sales of peg intron 
as a result  quarterly sales of peg intron and the royalties we receive on those sales have flattened or declined in recent quarters 
we cannot assure you that pegasys will not continue to gain market share at the expense of peg intron which could result in lower peg intron sales and royalties to us 
similarly  fujisawa healthcare  inc and gilead pharmaceuticals are currently marketing ambisome  and intermune  inc is marketing amphotec  each of which is a liposomal version of amphotericin  for the treatment of fungal infections 
ambisome and amphotec compete with abelcet and sales of these competitive products have resulted in greater competitive pressure on abelcet sales 
depocyt  an injectable  sustained release formulation of the chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine for the treatment of lymphomatous meningitis  competes with the generic drugs  cytarabine and methotrexate  and oncaspar  a peg enhanced version of a naturally occurring enzyme called l asparaginase  competes with asparaginase to treat patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
existing and future products  therapies and technological approaches will compete directly with our products 
current and prospective competing products may provide greater therapeutic benefits for a specific problem or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost 
any product candidate that we develop and that obtains regulatory approval must then compete for market acceptance and market share 
our product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  healthcare payors and the medical community 
we may be sued for product liability 
because our products and product candidates are new treatments with limited  if any  past use on humans  their use during testing or after approval could expose us to product liability claims 
we maintain product liability insurance coverage in the total amount of million for claims arising from the use of our products in clinical trials prior to fda approval and for claims arising from the use of our products after fda approval 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing insurance coverage or obtain coverage for the use of our other products in the future 
also  this insurance coverage and our resources may not be sufficient to satisfy any liability resulting from product liability claims  and a product liability claim may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
because of the uncertainty of pharmaceutical pricing  reimbursement and healthcare reform measures  we may be unable to sell our products profitably in the united states 
the availability of reimbursement by governmental and other third party payors affects the market for any pharmaceutical product 
in recent years  there have been numerous proposals to change the healthcare system in the united states and further proposals are likely 
some of these proposals have included measures that would limit or eliminate payments for medical procedures and treatments or subject the pricing of pharmaceuticals to government control 
in addition  government and private third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both the coverage and the level of reimbursement of drug products 
consequently  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
our ability to commercialize our products will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of the products and related treatments will be available from third party payors 
if we or any of our collaborators succeeds in bringing one or more products to market  we cannot assure you that third party payors will establish and maintain price levels sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
in addition  lifetime limits on benefits included in most private health plans may force patients to self pay for treatment 
for example  patients who receive adagen are expected to require injections for their entire lives 
the cost of this treatment may exceed certain plan limits and cause patients to self fund further treatment 
furthermore  inadequate third party coverage may lead to reduced market acceptance of our products 
significant changes in the healthcare system in the united states or elsewhere could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 
risks related to our subordinated notes and common stock the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile which may significantly affect the trading price of our notes 
historically  the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range  and it is likely that the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future 
the market price of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors  including o the results of preclinical testing and clinical trials by us  our corporate partners or our competitors  o announcements of technical innovations or new products by us  our corporate partners or our competitors  o the status of corporate collaborations and supply arrangements  o regulatory approvals  o government regulation  o developments in patent or other proprietary rights  o public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us or others  o litigation  o acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide  and o general market conditions in our industry 
in addition  due to one or more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters  our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 
the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have especially affected the market price of the stock of many high technology and healthcare related companies 
such fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
nonetheless  these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
our notes are subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness 
our convertible subordinated notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness 
in the event of our bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization  or upon acceleration of the notes due to an event of default under the indenture and in certain other events  our assets will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after all senior indebtedness has been paid 
as a result  there may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the outstanding notes 
we are not prohibited from incurring debt  including senior indebtedness  under the indenture 
if we were to incur additional debt or liabilities  our ability to pay our obligations on the notes could be adversely affected 
as of june   we had no senior indebtedness outstanding 
we may be unable to redeem our notes upon a fundamental change 
we may be unable to redeem our notes in the event of a fundamental change 
upon a fundamental change  holders of the notes may require us to redeem all or a portion of the notes 
if a fundamental change were to occur  we may not have enough funds to pay the redemption price for all tendered notes 
any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness may contain similar provisions  or expressly prohibit the repurchase of the notes upon a fundamental change or may provide that a fundamental change constitutes an event of default under that agreement 
if a fundamental change occurs at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing or redeeming notes  we could seek the consent of our lenders to redeem the notes or could attempt to refinance this debt 
if we do not obtain a consent  we could not purchase or redeem the notes 
our failure to redeem tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture 
in such circumstances  or if a fundamental change would constitute an event of default under our senior indebtedness  the subordination provisions of the indenture would restrict payments to the holders of notes 
a fundamental change is any transaction or event whether by means of an exchange offer  liquidation  tender offer  consolidation  merger  combination  reclassification  recapitalization or otherwise in connection with which all or substantially all of our common stock is exchanged for  converted into  acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive  consideration which is not all or substantially all common stock that o is listed on  or immediately after the transaction or event will be listed on  a united states national securities exchange  or o is approved  or immediately after the transaction or event will be approved  for quotation on the nasdaq national market or any similar united states system of automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices 
the term fundamental change is limited to certain specified transactions and may not include other events that might adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of the notes or our common stock 
our obligation to offer to redeem the notes upon a fundamental change would not necessarily afford holders of the notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction  reorganization  merger or similar transaction involving us 
a public market for our notes may fail to develop or be sustained

the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in may   our board of directors authorized shares of series b preferred stock in connection with its adoption of a stockholder rights plan  under which we issued rights to purchase series b preferred stock to holders of the common stock 
upon certain triggering events  such rights become exercisable to purchase common stock or  in the discretion of our board of directors  series b preferred stock at a price substantially discounted from the then current market price of the common stock 
our stockholder rights plan could generally discourage a merger or tender offer involving our securities that is not approved by our board of directors by increasing the cost of effecting any such transaction and  accordingly  could have an adverse impact on stockholders who might want to vote in favor of such merger or participate in such tender offer 
while we have no present intention to authorize any additional series of preferred stock  such issuance  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock

we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
as a result of the initial offering of the notes  our long term debt is million 
this indebtedness has affected us by o significantly increasing our interest expense and related debt service costs  and o making it more difficult to obtain additional financing 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy the annual debt service payments that will be required under the notes 
this may require us to use a portion of the proceeds of the notes to pay interest or borrow additional funds or sell additional equity to meet our debt service obligations 
if we are unable to satisfy our debt service requirements  substantial liquidity problems could result  which would negatively impact our future prospects

the liquidity of  and trading markets for  the notes also may be adversely affected by general declines in the market for unrated debt 
such declines may adversely affect the liquidity of  and trading markets for  the notes  independent of our financial performance or prospects 
in addition  certain regulatory restrictions prohibit certain types of financial institutions from investing in unrated debt  which may further suppress demand for such securities
