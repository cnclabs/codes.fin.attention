item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
except for the historical matters contained herein  statements made in this annual report are forward looking and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the securities litigation reform act of critical accounting policies and estimates sec financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies as contemplated by frr see note to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
accounting for intangible assets 
in fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets fas  new rules for measuring the impairment of brand licenses  trademarks and intangibles and discontinued amortization for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
the value of our intangible assets  including brand licenses and trademarks  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we review intangible assets for impairment using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
allowance for sales returns 
as is customary in the prestige fragrance industry  we grant certain of our us department store customers the right to return product which does not sell through to consumers 
upon sale  we record a provision for estimated product returns based on our historical sell through experience  economic trends and changes in customer demand 
based upon this information  we provide an allowance for sales returns 
there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the factors influencing the allowance for returns and additional allowances in any particular period may be needed  reducing net income or increasing net loss 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover uncollectible accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including a customer by customer review for large accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers  or any one customer  deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required 
provisions for inventory obsolescence 
we record a provision for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  the estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
if there are changes to these estimates  additional provisions for inventory obsolescence may be necessary 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period of such determination 
since april  we have not made any changes of these critical accounting policies  nor have we made any material changes in any of the critical accounting estimates underlying these accounting policies  except for the adoption of emerging issues task force eitf described on page all discussions below include the effect of adopting eitf and the resulting reclassifications

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we sell our products worldwide with all such sales being denominated in united states dollars 
as a result  we are not at risk to any foreign exchange translation exposure  but could be subject to changes in political and economic conditions in many of these countries 
we closely monitor such conditions and are able  for the most part  to adjust our sales strategies accordingly 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our bank line of credit 
the bank line of credit bears interest at a variable rate  as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources 
we mitigate interest rate risk by continuously monitoring the interest rates and electing the lower of the fixed rate libor or prime rate option available under the line of credit 
as a result of borrowings associated with our operating and investing activities  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
as of march  and  primary source of funds for working capital and other needs was our million line of credit 
of the approximate million and million of short term and long term borrowings on the company s balance sheet as of march  and  respectively  approximately and  respectively  represented fixed rate instruments 
the line of credit bears interest at a floating rate of prime plus 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates would increase fiscal year and interest expense by approximately million in each year
