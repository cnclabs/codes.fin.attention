item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
we are a publicly traded limited partnership nyse symbol  epd that was formed in april to acquire  own  and operate all of the ngl processing and distribution assets of enterprise products company  or epco 
we conduct all of our business through our owned subsidiary  enterprise products operating lp  our operating partnership and its subsidiaries and joint ventures 
our general partner  enterprise products gp  llc  owns a interest in us and a interest in our operating partnership 
unless the context requires otherwise  references to we  us  our or the company are intended to mean the consolidated business and operations of enterprise products partners lp  which includes enterprise products operating lp and its subsidiaries 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the company and operating partnership included under item of this report on form k 
in addition  the reader should review cautionary statement regarding forward looking information and risk factors under item of this annual report for information regarding forward looking statements made in this discussion and certain risks inherent in our business 
other risks involved in our business are discussed under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk beginning on page of this report 
additionally  please see part iii  item for a discussion of related party matters  including our relationship with shell 
our results of operation we have five reportable operating segments pipelines  fractionation  processing  octane enhancement and other 
pipelines consists of ngl  petrochemical and natural gas pipeline systems  storage and import export terminal services 
fractionation primarily includes ngl fractionation  isomerization and propylene fractionation 
processing includes our natural gas processing business and related ngl marketing activities 
octane enhancement represents our interest in a facility that produces motor gasoline additives to enhance octane currently producing mtbe 
the other operating segment consists of fee based marketing services and various operational support activities 
our management evaluates segment performance based on our measurement of segment gross operating margin 
gross operating margin for each segment represents operating income before depreciation and amortization  lease expense obligations retained by epco  gains and losses on the sale of assets and selling  general and administrative expenses 
segment gross operating margin is exclusive of other income and expense transactions  provision for income taxes  minority interest and extraordinary charges 
we include equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in our measurement of segment gross operating margin 
our equity investments with industry partners are a vital component of our business strategy 
they are a means by which we conduct our operations to align our interests with a supplier of raw materials or a consumer of finished products 
this method of operation also enables us to achieve favorable economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business risk assumed versus what we could accomplish on a stand alone basis 
many of these businesses perform supporting or complementary roles to our other business operations 
for additional information regarding our business segments  see the notes to our consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report 
under the terms of an agreement we executed with epco at our formation in the epco agreement  see item  epco subleases to us certain equipment located at our mont belvieu facility and railcars for one dollar per year the retained leases 
epco holds these items pursuant to operating leases for which it has agreed to retain the corresponding lease payment obligation 
operating costs and expenses as shown in the statements of consolidated operations and comprehensive income treat the lease payments being made by epco as a non cash related party operating expense  with the offset to partners equity on the consolidated balance sheets recorded as a general contribution to the partnership 
epco does not receive any additional ownership rights as a result of its contribution to us of the retained leases 
in addition  epco has assigned to us the purchase options associated with these leases 
these purchase options are based on the estimated fair market values of the equipment at the end of their respective lease terms

costs and expenses increased million year to year primarily due to the addition of costs and expenses of acquired businesses and an unfavorable change in the results of our commodity hedging activities 
operating income decreased million primarily as a result of such changes 
pipelines 
gross operating margin from our pipelines segment was million for compared to million for on an energy equivalent basis  net pipeline throughput volume for was  mbpd compared to mbpd during our acquisition of the mid america and seminole ngl pipelines in july accounted for million of the improvement in segment gross operating margin and mbpd of the increase in throughput rates 
gross operating margin from our mont belvieu storage businesses improved million in primarily due to the acquisition of diamond koch s storage business in january another million of the improvement in year to year gross operating margin results from including a full year s results of operations from acadian gas  whereas included only nine months 
we acquired acadian gas in april fractionation 
gross operating margin from our fractionation segment was million for compared to million for we expanded our propylene fractionation business in february with the acquisition of splitter iii from diamond koch 
our propylene fractionation volumes increased to mbpd during from mbpd during gross operating margin from these businesses increased million year to year 
splitter iii accounted for mbpd of the increase in volumes and million of the increase in gross operating margin 
our isomerization business posted a million decrease in gross operating margin for when compared to isomerization volumes increased to mbpd during versus mbpd during the positive effect of the higher isomerization volumes was offset by a decrease in isomerization revenues 
certain of our isomerization fees are indexed to historical natural gas prices which were higher in relative to 
lastly  gross operating margin from our ngl fractionation businesses decreased million in when compared to ngl fractionation volumes increased to mbpd during from mbpd during the year to year decrease in ngl fractionation gross operating margin is primarily due to lower revenues from our mont belvieu facility caused by strong competition at this industry hub  partially offset by the addition of earnings from the toca western facility we acquired in june of the mbpd increase in ngl fractionation volumes  mbpd is due to our purchase of an additional interest in the mont belvieu facility and mbpd is due to the acquisition of toca western 
processing 
gross operating margin from our processing segment was a loss of million for compared to income of million for of the million change in gross operating margin  million is due to a decrease in results from our commodity hedging activities 
we recorded a loss of million from these activities during versus income of million during also  gross operating margin from ngl marketing activities included in this segment benefited from unusually strong demand for propane and isobutane during early and mid which did not repeat during the year to year net decline in commodity hedging results and earnings from our ngl marketing activities was partially offset by a favorable decrease in ngl inventory valuation adjustments 
also  gross operating margin for includes the million expense we recorded related to amounts owed to us by enron  which filed for bankruptcy in december our equity ngl production was mbpd during versus mbpd during the mbpd increase in equity ngl production rates is primarily due to improved gas processing conditions 
as noted above  the million decrease in commodity hedging results was the primary reason for the year to year decline in gross operating margin from this segment 
in order to manage the risks associated with our processing segment  we may enter into short term  highly liquid commodity financial instruments to hedge our exposure to price risks associated with natural gas  ngl production and inventories  firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions 
we have employed various hedging strategies to mitigate the effects of fluctuating commodity prices primarily ngl and natural gas prices on our earnings from processing segment businesses 
beginning in late and extending through march  a large number of our commodity hedging transactions were based on the historical relationship between natural gas prices and ngl prices 
this type of hedging strategy utilized the forward sale of natural gas at a fixed price with the expected margin on the settlement of the position offsetting or mitigating changes in the anticipated margins on ngl marketing activities and the market values of our equity ngl production 
throughout  this strategy proved very successful as the price of natural gas declined relative to our fixed positions and was responsible for most of the million in commodity hedging income we recorded during in late march  the effectiveness of this strategy was reduced due to an unexpected rapid increase in natural gas prices whereby the loss in the value of our fixed price natural gas financial instruments was not offset by increased gas processing margins 
due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding natural gas prices at the time  we decided that it was prudent to exit this strategy  and we did so by late april the increased ineffectiveness of this strategy is the primary reason for the million in commodity hedging losses recorded during a variety of factors influence whether or not our hedging strategies are successful 
for additional information regarding our financial instrument portfolios  see item a of this report 
octane enhancement 
our equity earnings from bef were million for compared to million for the improvement is primarily due to increased mtbe production attributable to less maintenance downtime 
on a gross basis  bef s mtbe production increased to mbpd during compared to mbpd during other 
gross operating margin from this segment decreased million year to year primarily due to an increase in information technology related facility support costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased to million during compared to million during the increase is primarily due to the additional staff and resources needed to support our expansion activities resulting from acquisitions and other business development 
the majority of the additional costs for are attributable to amounts we paid williams for transition services associated with our acquisition of mid america and seminole 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million during compared to million during the increase is primarily due to debt obligations we incurred as a result of business acquisitions and investments in inventory 
of the million increase in interest expense  million is attributable to the debt incurred to finance the mid america and seminole acquisitions 
in addition  income from our interest rate hedging activities which is recorded as a reduction in interest expense decreased million in when compared to the change in interest rate hedging results is primarily due to certain elections by counterparties during to terminate interest rate hedging agreements 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table shows our consolidated revenues  costs and expenses  and operating income for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands for year ended december  revenues   costs and expenses   operating income   revenues for increased million over those of the increase in revenue is primarily due to the acquisition of acadian gas from shell during the higher pipeline revenues were offset by a decline in ngl product prices during relative to which lowered revenues from our ngl marketing activities 
costs and expenses during were million higher than primarily due to the addition of costs and expenses of acquired businesses offset by decreased ngl product purchase prices and improved results from commodity hedging activities 
operating income increased million year to year primarily as a result of such changes 
pipelines 
gross operating margin from our pipelines segment was million for compared to million for on an energy equivalent basis  net pipeline throughput volume for was mbpd compared to mbpd during of the million increase in segment gross operating margin  million is due to the addition of earnings from natural gas pipelines we acquired during specifically  we acquired acadian gas from shell in april and equity ownership interests in four gulf of mexico systems from el paso in january the natural gas throughput on these systems accounted for mbpd of the mbpd increase in segment volumes  on an energy equivalent basis 
an additional million of the year to year increase in segment gross operating margin is attributable to our lou tex ngl pipeline  which was completed and began operations during the fourth quarter of gross operating margin from our houston ship channel ngl import facility and related hsc pipeline increased million in due to a rise in commercial butane imports related to isobutane production 
the increase in ngl import activity and related pipeline movements accounted for mbpd of the year to year increase in segment volumes 
fractionation 
gross operating margin from our fractionation segment was million for compared to million for our propylene fractionation volumes declined slightly in to mbpd from mbpd in gross operating margin from propylene fractionation increased million in over due to additional margins from brpc  which did not commence operations until the third quarter of our isomerization business posted an million increase in gross operating margin during when compared to isomerization volumes increased to mbpd during from mbpd during the increase in isomerization earnings is primarily due to certain of our isomerization fees being indexed to historical natural gas prices which were higher in relative to 
lastly  gross operating margin from our ngl fractionation business in declined million from levels  primarily as a result of lower in kind fees at norco 
in kind fee arrangements expose us to commodity price risk in that our revenues are dependent upon ngl market prices  which were generally lower in as compared to ngl fractionation volumes decreased to mbpd during from mbpd during the year to year decrease in ngl fractionation volumes is primarily due to lower mixed ngl extraction rates at regional gas plants during early  which in turn was caused by higher natural gas prices 
processing 
gross operating margin from our processing segment was million for compared to million for our equity ngl production decreased mbpd to mbpd during versus mbpd during the decrease in our equity ngl production rate is primarily due to less favorable gas processing economics during early caused by higher natural gas prices 
segment gross operating margin for includes million of commodity hedging income  an increase of million over such income in the increase in our commodity hedging income mitigated or exceeded the loss in value of our ngl production caused by commodity price movements during in addition  our ngl marketing activities benefited from unusually strong demand for propane and isobutane during early and mid we are exposed to settlement risk a form of credit risk with the counterparties of our financial instruments 
on all transactions where we are exposed to settlement risk  we analyze the counterparty s financial condition prior to entering an agreement  establish credit limits and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis 
in december  enron north america the counterparty to some of our commodity financial instruments filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as a result  we recorded a charge against earnings of million for all amounts owed to us by enron 
the enron amounts were unsecured and the amount that we may ultimately recover  if any  is not presently determinable 
octane enhancement 
our equity earnings from bef were million for compared to million for the decrease in equity earnings is primarily due to lower mtbe and by product prices in on a gross basis  bef s mtbe production was mbpd during and other 
gross operating margin from this segment decreased million year to year primarily due to an increase in information technology related facility support costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased to million during compared to million during the increase is primarily due to the additional staff and resources needed to support our expansion activities resulting from acquisitions and other business development 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million during compared to million during the increase is primarily due to debt obligations we incurred as a result of business acquisitions completed during in addition  income from our interest rate hedging activities which is recorded as a reduction in interest expense increased million in when compared to the change in interest rate hedging results is primarily due to certain elections by counterparties during and a general decrease in interest rates 
general outlook for we expect our business to be affected by the following key trends and events during our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us 
to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect  our expectations may vary materially from actual results 
o as a result of abnormally high natural gas prices during the first quarter of  we anticipate that ngl extraction rates at natural gas processing plants will be reduced 
high natural gas prices may result in the cost of energy consumed by our natural gas processing facilities exceeding the market value of ngls they extract 
during periods of unusually high natural gas prices  we discuss with natural gas producers possible ways to limit the unfavorable impact of these energy costs 
o the expected reduction in ngl extraction rates during the first quarter of may also result in lower pipeline throughput rates and ngl fractionation volumes 
o as a result of the lower ngl extraction rates noted above  the demand for and price of certain ngl products increased 
we expect that gross operating margin for our processing segment will benefit from these market price increases as ngl inventories held by our ngl marketing group are sold 
o the expansion of our neptune gas processing facility which began in october is expected to be complete during the fourth quarter of this expansion will increase neptune s gross gas processing capacity from bcf d to bcf d and will increase our ngl production capacity by mbpd 
o in late  starfish is scheduled to complete construction of a mile gulf of mexico natural gas pipeline that will connect its stingray pipeline to new sources of deepwater gulf of mexico natural gas production 
o in march  we completed the purchase of the remaining ownership interests in epik from idemitsu 
as a result of this acquisition  segment earnings from ngl export activities will increase beginning in the first quarter of as we consolidate of this operation 
o we expect a modest decline in demand for isomerization services during as refiners reduce their mtbe production in advance of california s ban on mtbe of which isobutane is a feedstock which takes effect in january the decline in isobutane demand attributable to mtbe production may be offset by increased demand for isobutane in producing alkylate which could act as a replacement gasoline additive in place of mtbe 
o as a result of california s switch from using mtbe in its clean fuels program to ethanol in january  we expect that overall demand for mtbe over the course of will be weaker than in prior years 
this development will probably lead to lower mtbe prices which in turn will affect our equity earnings from bef 
our liquidity and capital resources as noted at the beginning of item of this report  the following represents a combined discussion of our liquidity and capital resources requirements and those of the operating partnership 
within this section  references to partnership equity pertains to limited partner interests issued by us  whereas references to debt pertains to those obligations entered into by our operating partnership 
general our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses and debt service  are for capital expenditures both sustaining and expansion related  business acquisitions and distributions to our partners 
we expect to fund our short term needs for such items as operating expenses and sustaining capital expenditures with operating cash flows 
capital expenditures for long term needs resulting from internal growth projects and business acquisitions are expected to be funded by a variety of sources including either separately or in combination cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under commercial bank credit facilities and the issuance of additional partnership equity and public and private placement debt 
we expect to fund cash distributions to partners primarily with operating cash flows 
our debt service requirements are expected to be funded by operating cash flows and or refinancing arrangements 
operating cash flows primarily reflect the effects of net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization  equity income and cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates  fluctuations in fair values of financial instruments and changes in operating accounts 
the net effect of changes in operating accounts is generally the result of timing of sales and purchases near the end of each period 
cash flow from operations is primarily based on earnings from our business activities 
as a result  these cash flows are exposed to certain risks including fluctuations in ngl and energy prices  competitive practices in the midstream energy industry and the impact of operational and systems risks 
the products that we process  sell or transport are principally used as feedstocks in petrochemical manufacturing  in the production of motor gasoline and as fuel for residential  agricultural and commercial heating 
reduced demand for our products or services by industrial customers  whether because of general economic conditions  reduced demand for the end products made with ngl products  increased competition from petroleum based products due to pricing differences or other reasons  could have a negative impact on earnings and thus the availability of cash from operating activities 
for a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our businesses  see item of this report 
as noted above  certain of our liquidity and capital resource requirements are fulfilled by borrowings made under debt agreements and or proceeds from the issuance of additional partnership equity 
at december   we had approximately billion outstanding under various debt agreements 
on that date  total borrowing capacity under our commercial bank credit facilities was million of which million of capacity was available 
for additional information regarding our debt  see our debt obligations on page in february  we filed a universal shelf registration with the sec covering the issuance of an unspecified amount of partnership equity or public debt obligations separately or in combination 
in october  we sold million common units under this shelf registration which generated net proceeds to us of approximately million before offering expenses 
in january  we sold an additional million common units under this shelf registration which generated million in net proceeds before offering expenses 
we used net proceeds before offering expenses from both equity issues to reduce debt outstanding under our day term loan and for working capital purposes 
also  in january and february  we completed the issuance of million of private placement debt senior notes c and d that we expect to convert to public debt 
for additional information regarding the general use of proceeds from the from senior notes c and d and the january equity offering  see our footnote titled subsequent events in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report 
in addition  please read the section titled our debt obligations within this our liquidity and capital resources discussion for information regarding our debt obligations 
in january  we filed a new billion universal shelf registration statement with the sec covering the issuance of an unallocated amount of partnership equity or public debt obligations separately or in combination 
in accordance with rule p promulgated under the securities act of  as amended  the registration fee associated with the unsold portion of the securities under the shelf registration statement filed in february was used to offset the registration fee due in connection with our billion universal shelf registration statement 
as a result  at the time our billion shelf registration statement is declared effective by the sec  the securities remaining under the shelf registration statement filed in february will be deemed deregistered 
we have the ability to issue an unlimited number of common units to finance acquisitions and capital improvements if adjusted operating surplus as defined within our partnership agreement for each of the four fiscal quarters immediately preceding the expenditure  on a pro forma basis  would have increased as a result of such expenditure ie  would have been accretive on a pro forma basis for each of the quarters in the test 
for those acquisitions and other transactions that do not qualify under the aforementioned pro forma accretive test  we have  units available for general partnership purposes during the subordination period 
the subordination period generally extends until the first day of any quarter beginning after june  when certain financial tests have been satisfied 
after the subordination period expires  we may prudently issue an unlimited number of units for general partnership purposes that do not meet the pro forma accretive test 
if deemed necessary  we believe that additional financing arrangements can be obtained at reasonable terms 
furthermore  we believe that maintenance of our investment grade credit ratings combined with a continued ready access to debt and equity capital at reasonable rates and sufficient trade credit to operate our businesses efficiently provide a solid foundation to meet our long and short term liquidity and capital resource requirements 
the following discussions highlight significant year to year comparisons in consolidated operating  investing and financing cash flows 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating cash flows 
cash flow from operating activities was an inflow of million during compared to million during the following table summarizes the major components of operating cash flows for and dollars in thousands for year ended december  net income   adjustments to reconcile net income to cash flows provided by used for operating activities before changes in operating accounts depreciation and amortization   equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates   distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates   non cash changes in fair market value of financial instruments   other   cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating accounts   net effect of changes in operating accounts   operating activities cash flows   as shown in the table above  cash flow before changes in operating accounts was an inflow of million during versus million during we believe that cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating accounts is an important measure of our liquidity 
we believe it provides an indication of our ability to generate core cash flows from the assets and investments we own or in which we have an interest 
the million year to year decrease in this element of our cash flows is primarily due to net hedging losses in versus net hedging income in offset by increased distributions from unconsolidated affiliates and earnings from businesses we acquired during the million increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to businesses we acquired during changes in operating accounts are generally the result of timing of cash receipts from sales and cash payments for inventory  purchases and other expenses near the end of each period

financing activities also reflect the net proceeds and related general partner contributions from our october issuance of million new common units 
net proceeds before offering expenses from the sale of the common units were million from which offering expenses of approximately million were paid 
this amount includes the general partner s aggregate contribution to us and our operating partnership of million to maintain its combined general partner interest 
cash distributions to our partners increased million year to year primarily due to increases in both the declared quarterly distribution rates and the number of units eligible for distributions 
the number of units eligible for distributions was higher in due to the conversion of million of shell s special units to an equal number of common units in august and our issuance of the million new common units in october debt issue costs increased million year to year primarily due to the million in fees we paid to banks in july associated with the short term financing of the mid america and seminole acquisitions

whichever base interest rate we selected  the rate was increased by an appropriate applicable margin as defined within the loan agreement 
during  the weighted average interest rate charged was 
this facility contained various covenants similar to those of our revolving credit facilities 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  day revolving credit facility

both notes are guaranteed by the mlp through an unsecured and unsubordinated guarantee and are non recourse to the general partner 
these notes were issued under an indenture containing certain covenants and are subject to a make whole redemption right 
these covenants restrict our ability  with certain exceptions  to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  mbfc loan 
in connection with the construction of our pascagoula  mississippi natural gas processing plant  we entered into a ten year fixed rate loan with the mississippi business finance corporation mbfc 
this loan is subject to a make whole redemption right and is guaranteed by mlp through an unsecured and unsubordinated guarantee 
the indenture agreement for this loan contains an acceleration clause whereby the outstanding principal and interest on the loan may become due and payable within days if our credit ratings decline below a baa rating by moody s currently baa and below a bbb rating by standard and poors currently bbb 
under these circumstances  the trustee as defined within the loan agreement may  and if requested to do so by holders of at least of the principal amount of the underlying bonds  shall accelerate the maturity of the mbfc loan  whereby the principal and all accrued and unpaid interest would become immediately due and payable 
if such an event occurred  we would have the option of to redeem the mbfc loan or to provide an alternate credit agreement to support our obligation under the mbfc loan 
we would have days to exercise these options upon receiving notice of the decline in our credit ratings 
the mbfc loan agreement contains certain covenants including the maintenance of appropriate levels of insurance on the pascagoula facility and restrictions regarding mergers 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  seminole notes 
as a result of our acquisition of of seminole in july  we are required to consolidate its debt with our other debt obligations 
at december   seminole had million in fixed rate senior unsecured notes  of which million is due annually each december through december the seminole notes contain various covenants  such as minimum net worth requirements and those restricting seminole s ability to borrow additional funds 
seminole was in compliance with these covenants at december  new debt obligations issued during first quarter of january senior notes offering 
in january  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due senior notes c  from which we received net proceeds before offering expenses of approximately million 
we used the proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the indebtedness outstanding under the day term loan that we incurred to finance the mid america and seminole acquisitions 
february senior notes offering 
in february  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due senior notes d  from which we received net proceeds before offering expenses of approximately million 
we used million from this offering to repay the remaining principal balance outstanding under the day term loan 
in addition  we applied million of the proceeds to reduce the balance outstanding under the day revolving credit facility 
the remaining proceeds were used for working capital purposes 
credit ratings our current investment grade credit ratings are baa by moody s investor service and bbb by standard and poors 
upon our acquisitions of the mid america and seminole pipelines  which were financed by the billion day term loan  both agencies maintained our ratings  however  each placed us on negative outlook pending the issuance of an appropriate amount of equity 
the agencies have responded positively to our recent equity and debt offerings 
we believe that the maintenance of an investment grade credit rating is important in managing our liquidity and capital resource requirements 
we maintain regular communications with these ratings agencies which independently judge our creditworthiness based on a variety of quantitative and qualitative factors 
cash requirements for future growth acquisitions 
we are committed to the long term growth and viability of the company 
our strategy involves expansion through business acquisitions and internal growth projects 
in recent years  major oil and gas companies have sold non strategic assets in the midstream energy industry in which we operate 
we forecast that this trend will continue  and expect independent oil and natural gas companies to consider similar divestures 
management continues to analyze potential acquisitions  joint venture or similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets and geographic regions 
we believe that the company is positioned to continue to grow through acquisitions that will expand its platform of assets and through internal growth projects 
our goal is to invest million annually in such opportunities to the extent we believe such investments will be accretive to our unitholders 
we expect that the funds needed to achieve this goal will be obtained through a combination of operating cash flows  public and private placement debt  and the issuance of partnership equity 
our billion in business acquisitions and internal growth projects we completed during were initially funded with approximately billion of debt 
this will translate into increased debt service costs in the future 
to the extent proceeds from future partnership equity offerings are used to reduce the principal amount of debt  our interest expense will be reduced 
to the extent we refinance our existing debt with new debt  our interest expense will generally be affected by differences in interest rates charged on the existing debt versus the new debt and by any fees associated with the new debt 
distributions 
another stated goal of management is to increase the distribution rate to our partners by at least annually 
at the end of  the declared annual rate was per common unit  which was higher than the rate in effect at the end of an increase in our distribution rate will translate into additional cash payments to existing unitholders 
in addition  an increase in the number of units eligible for cash distributions will result in higher payments 
we issued million new common units in january and expect to convert shell s remaining million special units to distribution bearing common units in august both of these transactions will have the effect of increasing cash distributions over those paid during on an annualized basis assuming a distribution rate of per common unit  our distributions to partners would increase by million as a result of these additional million common units 
we believe that all cash distributions will be paid out of operating cash flows over the long term  however  from time to time  we may temporarily borrow under our debt agreements for the purpose of paying cash distributions until the full impact of our operations are realized 
capital spending 
at december   we had million in estimated outstanding purchase commitments attributable to capital projects 
of this amount  million is related to the construction of assets that will be recorded as property  plant and equipment and million is associated with our share of capital projects of our unconsolidated affiliates which will be recorded as additional investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
during  we expect capital spending on internal growth projects to approximate million  of which million is forecasted for various projects within our pipelines segment  million for the expansion of our norco ngl fractionator and million for the expansion of our neptune gas processing facility 
our unconsolidated affiliates forecast a combined million in capital expenditures during  the majority of which relate to expansion projects on our gulf of mexico natural gas pipeline systems 
our share of these forecasted capital expenditures is estimated at million 
at our formation  epco contributed various equipment leases to us for which they have retained the liability for the lease payments the retained leases 
these leases relate to an isomerization unit  a dib tower  two cogeneration units and approximately railcars 
epco has assigned to us the purchase options associated with these leases 
if we decide to exercise these purchase options which are at fair market value  up to million is expected to be payable in  million in and million in as a result of new regulations imposing stricter air emissions requirements on petrochemical production and similar facilities in the houston galveston area  we are required to redesign and modify certain components of our mont belvieu facility to comply with these new clean air act requirements 
based upon these newly approved regulations  we estimate capital expenditures of to million in the aggregate will be required to modify our mont belvieu facilities 
through december   we spent million related to this project 
we forecast to spend between two and three million dollars for such modifications during the remaining amount is expected to be spent between and for additional information regarding these new regulations  see business and properties regulation and environmental matters general impact of the clean air act on our operations under items and of this annual report 
summary of material contractual obligations the following table summarizes our material contractual obligations at december  dollars in thousands  volumes as stated through through after contractual obligations total scheduled principal payments to be made under debt obligations     potential payments under letter of credit agreements   payments due under operating leases      capital expenditure commitments   long term purchase commitments expressed in terms of minimum volumes under contract per period ngls mbbls      petrochemicals mbbls     natural gas bbtus      our scheduled principal payments reflect consolidated amounts due under public and private placement debt obligations 
total principal amount outstanding under debt obligations as shown in the table above does not reflect the issuance of our million senior notes c in january due and million senior notes d in february due nor does it reflect the complete repayment of the day term loan in february our potential payments under letter of credit agreements are associated with our purchase of hydrocarbon imports and the guarantee of our share of evangeline s debt service reserve requirements 
for additional information regarding our debt obligations  please see our debt obligations on page of this annual report 
we lease certain equipment and processing facilities under noncancelable and cancelable operating leases 
the payments due under these leases as shown above represent our minimum future rental payments 
the operating lease commitments shown above exclude the non cash related party expense associated with various equipment leases contributed to us by epco at our formation for which epco has retained the liability the retained leases 
we routinely invest in capital projects of our own and in those of our unconsolidated affiliates 
the amount shown above reflects the committed expenditures under these projects at december  lastly  we have long term purchase commitments for ngls  petrochemicals and natural gas with several suppliers 
in general  the purchase prices contained within these supply contracts approximate market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes 
recent accounting developments we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  this standard establishes accounting standards for all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets on january  this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and or disposal of long lived assets 
for information regarding our goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets  please see the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  on january  this statement establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro and the associated asset retirement cost 
an aro exists when a company determines that it has a clearly defined legal obligation upon retirement of a long lived asset or any component part thereof and that the legal obligation will lead to the future payment of funds to a third party upon retirement of the asset 
in general  legal obligations underlying aros result from enacted laws and regulations or from contractual provisions related to long lived assets 
aros can also arise through the normal course of operating a long lived fixed asset 
an aro liability will be recorded on the balance sheet if a reasonable estimate of fair value of the obligation can be made 
our estimate of fair value for each aro is primarily dependent upon a clearly defined plan of retirement dates  methods  etc 
and costs associated with the retirement activity 
if a reasonable estimate cannot be made ie  no current or required plans for retirement of the asset  etc  footnote disclosure is required but the aro is not recorded until a reasonable estimate can be made 
any earnings impact resulting from the recognition of an aro upon adoption of sfas no 
should be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we reviewed our long lived assets for aro s by segment 
we identified  but have not recognized  aro liabilities in several operational areas 
these include aro liabilities related to easements over property not currently owned by us 
our rights to the easements are renewable and only require retirement action upon nonrenewal of the easement agreements 
we currently plan to renew all such easement agreements and use these properties indefinitely 
therefore  the aro liability is not estimable for such easements 
if we decide not to renew these agreements  an aro liability would be recorded at that time 
aro liabilities related to statutory regulatory requirements for abandonment or retirement of certain currently operated facilities were also identified 
we currently have no intention or legal obligation to abandon or retire such facilities 
an aro liability would be recorded if future abandonment or retirement occurred 
certain gulf of mexico natural gas pipelines  in which we have an equity interest  have identified aro s relating to regulatory requirements 
there is no current intention to abandon or retire these pipelines 
if these pipelines were abandoned or retired  an aro liability would then be disclosed 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operations  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
previous accounting guidance was provided by eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
replaces issue sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we adopted this statement on january  and determined that it had no material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements from guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation of sfas no 
 and  and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are applicable for financial statements of interim or annual periods after december  see our debt obligations on page for the disclosure of parent subsidiary guarantor relationships 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which provides alternative methods of transition from a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
in both annual and interim financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december   and financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  epco has stock based employee compensation plans for which we have a funding commitment for certain employees 
we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our financial statements 
our critical accounting policies in our financial reporting process  we employ methods  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
these methods  estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates should the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect 
examples of these estimates and assumptions include depreciation methods and estimated lives of property  plant and equipment  amortization methods and estimated lives of qualifying intangible assets  methods employed to measure the fair value of goodwill  revenue recognition policies and mark to market accounting procedures 
the following describes the estimation risk in each of these significant financial statement items o property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated using the straight line method over the asset s estimated useful life 
our plants  pipelines and storage facilities have estimated useful lives of five to years 
our miscellaneous transportation equipment have estimated useful lives of three to years 
depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset s cost  less its residual value if any  to the periods it benefits 
straight line depreciation results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of the asset 
the determination of an asset s estimated useful life must take a number of factors into consideration  including technological change  normal depreciation and actual physical usage 
if any of these assumptions subsequently change  the estimated useful life of the asset could change and result in an increase or decrease in depreciation expense 
additionally  if we determine that an asset s undepreciated cost may not be recoverable due to economic obsolescence  the business climate  legal or other factors  we would review the asset for impairment and record any necessary reduction in the asset s value as a charge against earnings 
at december  and  the net book value of our property  plant and equipment was billion and billion  respectively 
o intangible assets 
the specific  identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations 
potential intangible assets include intellectual property such as technology  patents  trademarks and trade names  customer contracts and relationships  and non compete agreements  as well as other intangible assets 
the approach to the valuation of each intangible asset will vary depending upon the nature of the asset  the business in which it is utilized  and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate 
our recorded intangible assets primarily include the estimated value assigned to certain contract based assets representing the rights we own arising from contractual agreements 
a contract based intangible with a finite useful life is amortized over its estimated useful life  which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the entity 
it is based on an analysis of all pertinent factors including a the expected use of the asset by the entity  b the expected useful life of related assets ie  fractionation facility  storage well  etc  c any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions  including renewal or extension periods that would not cause substantial costs or modifications to existing agreements  d the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors and e the level of maintenance required to obtain the expected future cash flows 
at december   our significant intangible assets consisted of the following along with unamortized balances of each group at that date o the shell natural gas processing agreement that we acquired as part of the tngl acquisition in august million  o certain storage and propylene fractionation contracts we acquired in connection with the diamond koch acquisitions in january and february million  and o certain natural gas processing and ngl fractionation contracts we acquired in connection with the toca western acquisition in june million 
the shell natural gas processing agreement is being amortized on a straight line basis over the remainder of its initial year contract term 
the propylene fractionation and storage contracts acquired from diamond koch are being amortized on a straight line basis over the economic life of the assets to which they relate  which is currently estimated at years 
the toca western natural gas processing contracts are being amortized on a straight line basis over the expected year remaining life of the natural gas supplies supporting these contracts 
the toca western ngl fractionation contracts are being amortized on a straight line basis over the expected year remaining life of the assets to which they relate 
if the underlying assumption s governing the amortization of an intangible asset were later determined to have significantly changed either favorably or unfavorably  we then might need to adjust the amortization period of such asset to reflect any new estimate of its useful life 
such a change would increase or decrease the annual amortization charge associated with the asset at that time 
during  we did not find it necessary to adjust the estimated useful life or amortization period of any of our intangible assets 
should any of the underlying assumptions indicate that the value of the intangible asset might be impaired  we then might need to reduce its carrying value and subsequent useful life 
any such write down of the value and unfavorable change in the useful life ie  amortization period of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time 
during  we did not recognize any impairment losses related to our intangible assets 
o goodwill 
at december   the recorded value of goodwill was million 
our goodwill is attributable to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and is primarily comprised of the million associated with the purchase of propylene fractionation assets from diamond koch in february since our adoption of sfas no 
on january   our goodwill amounts are no longer amortized 
instead  goodwill is tested at a reporting unit level annually  and more frequently  if certain circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount 
if such indicators are present ie  loss of a significant customer  economic obsolescence of plant assets  etc  the fair value of the reporting unit  including its related goodwill  is calculated and compared to its combined book value 
currently  all of our goodwill is recorded as part of the fractionation operating segment based on the assets to which the goodwill relates 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its book value  goodwill is not considered impaired and no adjustment to earnings would be required 
should the fair value of the reporting unit including its goodwill be less than its book value  a charge to earnings would be recorded to adjust goodwill to its implied fair value 
o revenue recognition 
in general  we recognize revenue from our customers when all of the following criteria are met i firm contracts are in place  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii pricing is fixed and determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
when contracts settle ie  either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed  we determine if an allowance is necessary and record it accordingly 
the revenues that we record are not materially based on estimates 
we believe the assumptions underlying any revenue estimates that we might use will not prove to be significantly different from actual amounts due to the routine nature of these estimates and the stability of our operations 
of the contracts that we enter into with customers  the majority fall within five main categories as described below o tolling or throughput arrangements where we process or transport customer volumes for a cash fee usually on a per gallon or other unit of measurement basis  o product sales contracts where we sell products to customers at market related prices for cash  o storage agreements where we store volumes or reserve storage capacity for customers for a cash fee  and o fee based marketing services where we market volumes for customers for either a percentage of the final cash sales price or a cash fee per gallon handled 
a number of tolling arrangements are utilized in our fractionation and pipeline segments 
examples include ngl fractionation  isomerization and pipeline transportation agreements 
typically  we recognize revenue from tolling arrangements once contract services have been performed 
at times  the tolling fees we or our affiliates charge for pipeline transportation services are regulated by such governmental agencies as the ferc 
at certain of our ngl fractionation facilities  an in kind tolling arrangement is utilized 
an in kind processing contract allows us to retain a contractually determined percentage of ngl products fractionated for our customer in lieu of collecting a cash tolling fee per gallon 
fractionation revenue is recognized and recorded on a monthly basis for transfers of in kind retained ngl products to the ngl working inventory maintained within our processing segment where it is then held for sale 
transfer pricing for these retained ngls is based upon monthly market posted prices for such products 
this intersegment revenue and offsetting cost to the processing segment is eliminated in our reporting of consolidated revenues and expenses 
our processing segment activities employ tolling and product sales contracts 
if a customer pays us a cash tolling fee for our natural gas processing services  we record revenue to the extent that natural gas volumes have been processed and sent back to the producer 
if the natural gas processing contract stipulates that we retain a percentage of the extracted ngls as payment for our services  revenue is recognized and recorded when the extracted ngls are delivered out of our inventory and sold to customers on sales contracts 
our ngl marketing activities within this segment also use product sales contracts to sell and deliver out of inventory the ngls transferred to it as a result of the fractionation segment s in kind arrangements and those it purchases for cash in the open market 
these ngl sales contracts may include forward product sales contracts from time to time 
revenues from ngl sales contracts are recognized and recorded upon the delivery of the ngl products specified in each individual contract 
in addition to the processing segment  product sales contracts are utilized in the fractionation segment to record revenues from the sale of petrochemical products and in the pipelines segment to record revenues from the sale of natural gas 
pricing terms in our product sales contracts are based upon market related prices for such products and can include pricing differentials due to factors such as differing delivery locations 
o fair value accounting for commodity financial instruments 
our earnings are also affected by use of the mark to market method of accounting required under gaap for certain financial instruments 
we use short term  highly liquid financial instruments such as swaps  forwards and other contracts to manage price risks associated with inventories  firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions  primarily within our processing segment 
as of december   none of our commodity financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment and thus the changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet and through earnings ie  using the mark to market method rather than being deferred until the firm commitment or anticipated transaction affects earnings 
the use of mark to market accounting for financial instruments may cause our non cash earnings to fluctuate based upon changes in underlying indexes  primarily commodity prices 
fair value for the financial instruments we employ is determined using price data from highly liquid markets such as the nymex commodity exchange 
for the year ended december   we recognized losses from our commodity hedging activities of million 
of this loss  million is attributable to the negative change in market value of the commodity hedging portfolio since december  using the mark to market method of accounting for our financial instruments 
the fair value of our commodity financial instrument portfolio at december  was a payable of thousand  based upon quoted market prices 
at that date  we had a limited number of open positions that extend through december for additional information regarding our use of financial instruments to manage risk and the earnings sensitivity of these instruments to changes in underlying commodity prices  see the processing segment discussion under our results of operations within this item and also read item a of this annual report 
additional information regarding our financial statements and those of the operating partnership can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements of each entity included elsewhere in this form k 
related party transactions relationship with epco and its affiliates we have an extensive and ongoing relationship with epco and its affiliates 
epco is majority owned and controlled by dan l 
duncan  chairman of the board and a director of the general partner 
in addition  three other members of the board of directors os andras  randa d 
williams and richard h 
bachmann and the remaining executive and other officers see item for a listing of these individuals of the general partner are employees of epco 
the principal business activity of our general partner is to act as our managing partner 
collectively  epco and its affiliates which includes the trust  trust and dan l 
duncan owned of our limited partnership interests and of our general partner at december  we have no employees 
all of our management  administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of epco pursuant to the epco agreement see item 
we reimburse epco for the costs of its employees who perform operating functions for us 
in addition  we reimburse epco for the costs of certain of employees who manage our business and affairs 
epco is also the operator of certain facilities we own or have an equity interest in 
we have also entered into an agreement with epco to provide trucking services to us for the loading and transportation of products 
lastly  in the normal course of business  we buy from and sell ngl products to epco s canadian affiliate 
during  our related party revenues from epco were million and our related party expenses with epco were million 
for additional information regarding our relationship with epco  see item of this annual report 
relationship with shell we have an extensive and ongoing commercial relationship with shell as a partner  customer and vendor 
shell currently owns approximately of our limited partnership interests and of our general partner 
currently  three members of the board of directors of the general partner ja berget  ja eagan and ay noojin  iii are employees of shell 
shell and its affiliates are the company s single largest customer 
during  they accounted for of our consolidated revenues 
our revenues from shell reflect the sale of ngl and petrochemical products to them and the fees we charge them for pipeline transportation and ngl fractionation services 
our operating costs and expenses with shell primarily reflect the payment of energy related expenses related to the shell natural gas processing agreement see the processing segment discussion under item of this annual report and the purchase of ngl products from them 
during  our related party revenues from shell were million and our related party expenses with shell were million 
we have completed a number of business acquisitions and asset purchases involving shell since among these transactions were o the acquisition of tngl s natural gas processing and related businesses in for million this purchase price includes both the million in cash we paid to shell and the value of the three issues of special units granted to shell in connection with this acquisition  o the purchase of the lou tex propylene pipeline system for million in  and  o the acquisition of acadian gas in for million 
shell is also a partner with us in the gulf of mexico natural gas pipelines we acquired from el paso in we also lease from shell its interest in our splitter i propylene fractionation facility 
other items uncertainties regarding our investment in facilities that produce mtbe we have a ownership interest in bef  which owns a facility currently producing mtbe 
at december   the carrying value of our investment in bef was million 
our equity earnings from bef which are recorded under our octane enhancement segment were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
in recent years  mtbe has been detected in water supplies 
the major source of ground water contamination appears to be leaks from underground storage tanks 
although these detections have been limited and the great majority have been well below levels of public health concern  there have been calls for the phase out of mtbe in motor gasoline in various federal and state governmental agencies and advisory bodies 
bef has not been named in any mtbe legal action to date 
for additional information regarding the impact of environmental regulation on bef  see business and properties regulation and environmental matters impact of the clean air act s oxygenated fuels programs on our bef investment under item of this annual report 
during  the city of santa monica brought suit against seven major oil companies and eleven other manufacturers  suppliers  refiners and pipeline operators alleging the defendants had tainted much of the city s drinking water supply with mtbe 
in mid july  the city settled with two of the major oil companies 
under the terms of this settlement  the two defendants agreed to pay to design  build and operate a facility to treat the city s water at a cost of approximately million and to pay million in other damages 
the court agencies involved in this case are reviewing this settlement 
the city is still pursuing legal action against the remaining defendants 
in april  a jury in california found three energy companies liable for polluting lake tahoe s drinking water with mtbe 
while this decision sets no legal precedent  this was the first time that a jury has defined gasoline containing mtbe to be a defective product 
in august  two of the defendants were ordered to pay million to a lake tahoe area utility district 
the third defendant settled out of court for million in july in light of these developments  we and the other two owners of bef are actively compiling a contingency plan for the bef facility should mtbe be banned 
we are currently evaluating a possible conversion of the facility from mtbe production to alkylate production 
in addition to mtbe s value in reducing air pollution  it is a significant source of octane in the us motor gasoline pool 
octane is a critical component of motor gasoline 
therefore  we believe that if mtbe usage is banned or significantly curtailed  the motor gasoline industry would need a substitute additive to maintain octane levels in gasoline and that alkylate would be an economic and effective substitute 
we are currently conducting a detailed engineering study that is expected to be completed by the end of  at which time we expect a more definitive conversion cost estimate will be available 
the cost to convert the facility will depend on the type of alkylate process chosen and the level of production desired by the partnership 
two for one split of limited partner units on february   we announced that the board of directors of the general partner had approved a two for one split for each class of our units 
the partnership unit split was accomplished by distributing one additional partnership unit for each partnership unit outstanding to holders of record on april  the units were distributed on may  all references to number of units or earnings per unit contained in this document relate to the post split units  except if indicated otherwise 
conversion of epco subordinated units and shell special units to common units as a result of the company satisfying certain financial tests   or of epco s subordinated units converted to common units on may  if the financial criteria continue to be satisfied through the first quarter of  an additional of the subordinated units will undergo an early conversion on a one for one basis to common units on may  the remaining of subordinated units will convert on august  if the balance of the conversion requirements are met 
subordinated units have limited voting rights until converted to common units 
the conversion s will have no impact upon our distributions or earnings per unit since the subordinated units are already distribution bearing and included in both the basic and fully diluted calculations 
in accordance with existing agreements with shell  million of shell s non distribution bearing special units converted to distribution bearing common units on august  the remaining million special units will convert to common units on a one for one basis in august these conversions have a dilutive impact on basic earnings per unit since they increase the number of common units used in the computation 
as a result of the august conversion of the shell special units to an equal number of common units  our basic earnings per unit for were reduced by 
special units are excluded from the computation of basic earnings per unit because  under the terms of the special units  they do not share in income nor are they entitled to cash distributions until they are converted to common units 
facility and sensitive infrastructure security matters following the terrorist attacks in the united states  we instituted a review of security measures and practices and emergency response capabilities for all facilities and sensitive infrastructure 
in connection with this activity  we have participated in security coordination efforts with law enforcement and public safety authorities  industry mutual aid groups and regulatory agencies 
as a result of these steps  we believe that our security measures  techniques and equipment have been enhanced as appropriate on a location by location basis 
further evaluation will be ongoing  with additional measures to be taken as specific governmental alerts  additional information about improving security and new facts come to our attention 
sec review in connection with registration statements on forms s and s that we filed on january   we have received comments from the staff of the division of corporation finance of the securities and exchange commission in connection with a routine review 
the comments covered the registration statements and the documents incorporated by reference in the registration statements  including our annual report on form k for the year ended december  on march   we formally responded to the staff s comments and filed amendments to the forms s and s we have also had informal discussions with the staff concerning their comments and our responses 
we believe that we have been fully responsive to all of the staff s comments  and have incorporated those comments into this annual report 
however  the staff may have additional comments that could affect the disclosure contained in this annual report and previous filings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
we may use financial instruments ie  futures  forwards  swaps  options  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to mitigate the risks of certain identifiable and anticipated transactions  primarily within our processing segment 
in general  the types of risks we attempt to hedge are those relating to the variability of future earnings and cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
as a matter of policy  we do not use financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
for additional information regarding our financial instruments  see the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk the prices of natural gas  ngls  petrochemical products and mtbe are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
in order to manage the risks associated with our processing segment activities  we may enter into various commodity financial instruments 
the primary purpose of these risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to price risks associated with natural gas  ngl production and inventories  firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions 
the commodity financial instruments we utilize may be settled in cash or with another financial instrument 
we do not hedge our exposure related to mtbe price risks 
in addition  we generally do not hedge risks associated with the petrochemical marketing activities that are part of our fractionation segment 
in our pipelines segment  we do utilize a limited number of commodity financial instruments to manage the price acadian gas charges certain of its customers for natural gas 
lastly  due to the nature of the transactions  we do not employ commodity financial instruments in our fee based marketing business accounted for in the other segment 
we have adopted a policy to govern our use of commodity financial instruments to manage the risks of our natural gas and ngl businesses 
the objective of this policy is to assist us in achieving our profitability goals while maintaining a portfolio with an acceptable level of risk  defined as remaining within the position limits established by the general partner 
we enter into risk management transactions to manage price risk  basis risk  physical risk or other risks related to our commodity positions on both a short term less than days and long term basis  not to exceed months 
the general partner oversees our strategies associated with physical and financial risks such as those mentioned previously  approves specific activities subject to the policy including authorized products  instruments and markets and establishes specific guidelines and procedures for implementing and ensuring compliance with the policy 
our commodity financial instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the specific guidelines of sfas no 
because of ineffectiveness 
a financial instrument is generally regarded as effective when changes in its fair value almost fully offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item throughout the term of the instrument 
due to the complex nature of risks we attempt to hedge  our commodity financial instruments have generally not qualified as effective hedges under sfas no 
 with the result being that changes in the fair value of these positions being recorded on the balance sheet and in earnings through mark to market accounting 
mark to market accounting results in a degree of non cash earnings volatility that is dependent upon changes in the commodity prices underlying these financial instruments 
even though these financial instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 we view such contracts as hedges since this was the intent when we entered into such positions 
upon entering into such positions  our expectation is that the economic performance of these instruments will mitigate or offset the commodity risk being addressed 
the specific accounting for these contracts  however  is consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
we assess the risk of our commodity financial instrument portfolio using a sensitivity analysis model 
the sensitivity analysis performed on this portfolio measures the potential income or loss eg  the change in fair value of the portfolio based upon a hypothetical movement in the underlying quoted market prices of the commodity financial instruments outstanding at the dates noted within the following table 
in general  the quoted market prices used in the model are from those actively quoted on commodity exchanges ie  nymex for instruments of similar duration 
in those rare instances where prices are not actively quoted  we employ regression analysis techniques possessing strong correlation factors 
the sensitivity analysis model takes into account the following primary factors and assumptions o the current quoted market price of natural gas  o the current quoted market price of ngls  o changes in the composition of commodities hedged ie  the mix between natural gas and related ngls  o fluctuations in the overall volume of commodities hedged for both natural gas and related ngl hedges outstanding  o market interest rates  which are used in determining the present value  and o a liquid market for such financial instruments 
an increase in fair value of the commodity financial instruments based upon the factors and assumptions noted above approximates the income that would be recognized if all of the commodity financial instruments were settled at the dates noted within the table 
conversely  a decrease in fair value of the commodity financial instruments would result in the recording of a loss 
the sensitivity analysis model does not include the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged commodity positions to which they relate 
therefore  the impact on the fair value of the commodity financial instruments of a change in commodity prices would be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged commodity positions  assuming o the commodity financial instruments function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk  o the commodity financial instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term  and o as applicable  anticipated underlying transactions settle as expected 
we routinely review our outstanding financial instruments in light of current market conditions 
if market conditions warrant  some financial instruments may be closed out in advance of their contractual settlement dates thus realizing income or loss depending on the specific exposure 
when this occurs  we may enter into a new commodity financial instrument to reestablish the economic hedge to which the closed instrument relates 
the following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the fair value fv of our commodity financial instrument portfolio and the related potential impact on our earnings ie at the dates indicated values in thousands of dollars resulting at at at scenario classification fv assuming no change in quoted market prices asset liability  fv assuming increase in quoted market prices asset liability ie assuming increase in quoted market prices income loss  fv assuming decrease in quoted market prices asset liability  ie assuming decrease in quoted market prices income loss  at december   the net fair value of our commodity financial instruments portfolio was a million asset  almost all of which was based upon quoted market prices 
at december   the net fair value of this portfolio was a payable of thousand  based entirely upon quoted market prices 
due to commodity hedging losses we incurred during the first quarter of  we exited most of our positions see our processing segment discussion under our results of operations in item 
at december   we had a limited number of commodity financial instruments outstanding 
the fair value of the portfolio at march  was a thousand asset and was again comprised of a limited number of positions 
during  we recognized a loss of million from our commodity hedging activities that was recorded as an increase in our operating costs and expenses in the statements of consolidated operations 
of the loss recognized in  million is related to non cash mark to market income recorded on open positions at december  during  we posted income of million from our commodity hedging activities  which served to reduce operating costs and expenses 
product purchase commitments 
we have long term purchase commitments for ngls  petrochemicals and natural gas with several suppliers 
the purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts are based on market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes 
interest rate risk our interest rate exposure results from variable interest rate borrowings and fixed interest rate borrowings 
we assess the cash flow risk related to interest rates by identifying and measuring changes in our interest rate exposures that may impact future cash flows and evaluating hedging opportunities to manage these risks 
we use analytical techniques to measure our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  including cash flow sensitivity analysis to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows 
the general partner oversees the strategies associated with these financial risks and approves instruments that are appropriate for our requirements 
interest rate swaps 
we manage a portion of our interest rate risks by utilizing interest rate swaps 
the objective of entering into interest rate swaps is to manage debt service costs by converting a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt or a portion of variable rate debt into fixed rate debt 
in general  an interest rate swap requires one party to pay a fixed interest rate on a notional amount while the other party pays a floating interest rate based on the same notional amount 
we believe that it is prudent to maintain an appropriate balance of variable rate and fixed rate debt 
the following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the fair value fv of our interest rate swap portfolio and the related potential impact on our earnings ie at the dates indicated values in thousands of dollars resulting at at scenario classification fv assuming no change in quoted market prices asset liability   fv assuming increase in quoted market prices asset liability   ie assuming increase in quoted market prices income loss fv assuming decrease in quoted market prices asset liability   ie assuming decrease in quoted market prices income loss at december  and  we had one interest rate swap outstanding having a notional amount of million that extended through march under the terms of the swap  the counterparty had the right to terminate the swap on march  the fair value of this swap was a million asset at december  the fair value of this swap at december  was million 
the change in fair value of this swap during is primarily due to settlements 
a change in interest rates at december  would have negligible effect on the fair value of this swap 
the counterparty elected to terminate this swap as of march  and we received million associated with the final settlement of this swap on that date 
we recognized income from our interest rate swaps of million during compared to million during this income is recorded as a reduction of interest expense in our statements of consolidated operations 
treasury locks 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into seven treasury lock transactions with original maturities of either january  or april  a treasury lock is a specialized agreement that fixes the price or yield on a specific us treasury security for an established period of time 
the purpose of these transactions was to hedge the underlying treasury interest rate associated with our anticipated issuance of debt in early to partially refinance the mid america and seminole acquisitions 
our treasury lock transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
the notional amounts of these transactions totaled million  with a total treasury lock rate of approximately 
we elected to settle all of the treasury locks by early february in connection with our issuance of senior notes c and d see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our liquidity and capital resource our debt obligations under item of this annual report 
the settlement of the treasury locks resulted in our receipt of million of cash 
the fair value of these instruments at december  was a current liability of million offset by a current asset of million 
the net million net liability was recorded as a component of comprehensive income on that date  with no impact to current earnings 
with the settlement of the treasury locks  the million net liability will be reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in partners equity to offset the current asset and liabilities we recorded at december   with no impact to earnings
