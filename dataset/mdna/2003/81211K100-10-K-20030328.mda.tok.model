because it is uncertain when such a plan of reorganization may become effective  this liability has been recorded as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the company currently expects to fund this payment either by using accumulated cash and future cash flows from operations  from the proceeds of future financings or from a combination of such alternatives 
the company entered into the following long term commitments during approximately  for the purchase of certain equipment over an eight year period beginning in  together with a potential termination fee in an amount to be determined 
the company s obligation is reduced or increased based on market price changes for the equipment and certain indexes 
failure to purchase any of the minimum annual requirements in any year obligates the company to pay an amount of of such shortfall 
approximately  to a supplier if the company fails to purchase  pounds of certain raw materials  at the then current market price  over a ten year period that began in may  the amount of the potential contingent payment declines in proportion to the company s purchase of minimum quantities required under the contract 
at december   the company s purchases were in line with the minimum quantity requirements under the agreement 
derivative financial instruments at december  and the company was party to foreign currency forward contracts  which did not have a significant impact on the company s liquidity

series a convertible preferred stock the company s series a preferred stock is listed on the new york stock exchange and is convertible at any time into approximately of a share of common stock for each share of preferred stock 
these shares vote with the common stock on an as converted basis and are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends  when and as declared by the board of directors  at an annual rate of per share  payable quarterly in arrears on the first business day of the succeeding calendar quarter 
the series a preferred stock ranks senior to the company s common stock and junior to the company s indebtedness 
on and after march   the series a preferred stock is redeemable at the option of the company at a price of per share declining ratably on each march thereafter to per share on and after march   plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
the series a preferred stock is subject to mandatory redemption on march  at per share  plus any accrued and unpaid dividends  to the extent these shares remain outstanding 
because it is subject to mandatory redemption  the series a convertible preferred stock is classified outside of the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
at its date of issuance  the fair value of the series a preferred stock exceeded its mandatory redemption amount primarily due to the common stock conversion feature 
accordingly  the book value of the series a preferred stock is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at its mandatory redemption value 
shareholders equity the company s shareholders equity was  at december    at december  and  at december  shareholders equity decreased in due to the following a reduction in retained earnings arising from the company s net loss of  and preferred stock dividends of additional foreign currency translation adjustments of partially offset by the  value of the  shares of common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement  and the excess of book value over the repurchase price of  recognized in connection with preferred stock repurchases 
shareholders equity increased in due to the following net earnings of  the excess of book value over the repurchase price of  recognized in connection with preferred stock repurchases  partially offset by preferred stock dividends of  and additional foreign currency translation adjustments of other matters cryovac transaction on march  the company completed a multi step transaction the cryovac transaction  which brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air corporation old sealed air under the common ownership of the company 
these businesses operate as subsidiaries of the company  and the company acts as a holding company 
as part of that transaction  the cryovac packaging business  held by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the company  was separated from the remaining businesses of the company 
such remaining businesses were then contributed to a company now known as w 
r 
grace co 
new grace  whose shares were distributed to the company s stockholders 
as a result  new grace became a separate publicly owned company 
the company recapitalized its outstanding shares of common stock into a new common stock and a new convertible preferred stock 
a subsidiary of the company then merged into old sealed air  which changed its name to sealed air corporation us 
the agreements pursuant to which the cryovac transaction was carried out are referred to below as the transaction agreements 
contingencies related to the cryovac transaction in connection with the cryovac transaction  new grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the cryovac transaction  whether accruing or occurring before or after the cryovac transaction  other than liabilities arising from or relating to cryovac s operations 
the liabilities retained by new grace include  among others  liabilities relating to asbestos containing products previously manufactured or sold by new grace s subsidiaries prior to the cryovac transaction  including its primary us operating subsidiary  w 
r 
grace co 
conn  which has operated for decades and has been a subsidiary of new grace since the cryovac transaction 
the transaction agreements provided that  should any claimant seek to hold the company  including any of its subsidiaries  responsible for liabilities of new grace or its subsidiaries  including such asbestos related liabilities  new grace and its subsidiaries would indemnify and defend the company 
since the beginning of  the company has been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that  as a result of the cryovac transaction  the company is responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of new grace and its subsidiaries  certain of which were also named as co defendants in some of these actions 
these actions include several purported class actions and a number of personal injury lawsuits 
some plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury or wrongful death  while others seek medical monitoring  environmental remediation or remedies related to an attic insulation product 
neither old sealed air nor cryovac ever produced or sold any of the asbestos containing materials that are the subjects of these cases 
none of these cases has been resolved through judgment  settlement or otherwise 
all such cases have been stayed in connection with new grace s chapter bankruptcy proceeding discussed below 
while the allegations in these actions directed to the company vary  these actions all appear to allege that the transfer of the cryovac business as part of the cryovac transaction was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability 
under a theory of successor liability  plaintiffs with claims against new grace and its subsidiaries may attempt to hold the company liable for liabilities that arose with respect to activities conducted prior to the cryovac transaction by w 
r 
grace co 
conn 
or other new grace subsidiaries 
a transfer would be a fraudulent transfer if the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value and the transferor was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by the transfer  was engaged or was about to engage in a business for which its assets constitute unreasonably small capital  or intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature 
a transfer may also be fraudulent if it was made with actual intent to hinder  delay or defraud creditors 
if any transfers in connection with the cryovac transaction were found by a court to be fraudulent transfers  the company could be required to return the property or its value to the transferor or could be required to fund certain liabilities of new grace or its subsidiaries for the benefit of their creditors  including asbestos claimants 
the company has reached an agreement in principle  described below  that will resolve all such claims 
previously  the company was unable to estimate the loss or range of loss in the event that there had been a finding that the cryovac transaction was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability 
in the joint proxy statement furnished to their respective stockholders in connection with the cryovac transaction  both sealed air and grace stated that it was their belief that new grace and its subsidiaries were adequately capitalized and would be adequately capitalized after the cryovac transaction and that none of the transfers contemplated to occur in the cryovac transaction would be a fraudulent transfer 
they also stated their belief that the cryovac transaction complied with other relevant laws 
however  if a court applying the relevant legal standards had reached conclusions adverse to the company  such determination could have had a materially adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
on april   new grace and certain of its subsidiaries filed a petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court in the district of delaware 
new grace stated that the filing was made in response to a sharply increasing number of asbestos claims since in connection with its chapter filing  new grace filed an application with the bankruptcy court seeking to stay  among others  all actions brought against the company including certain of its subsidiaries related to alleged asbestos liabilities of new grace and its subsidiaries or alleging fraudulent transfer claims 
the court issued an order dated may   which was modified on january   under which all such filed or pending actions against the company were stayed and all such future actions are stayed upon filing and service on the company 
no further proceedings involving the company can occur in the actions that have been stayed except upon further order of the bankruptcy court 
committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in new grace s bankruptcy case received the court s permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the company and its subsidiary cryovac  inc and against fresenius  as discussed below 
the claims against fresenius are based upon a transaction between fresenius and w 
r 
grace co 
conn 
fresenius is not affiliated with the company 
in march  the court ordered that the issues of the solvency of new grace following the cryovac transaction and whether new grace received reasonably equivalent value in the cryovac transaction would be tried on behalf of all creditors of new grace 
the proceeding is pending in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware adv 
no 

in june  the court permitted the us government to intervene as a plaintiff in the fraudulent transfer proceeding  so that the us government could pursue allegations that remediation expenses at certain sites were underestimated or omitted in the solvency analyses of new grace that were conducted at the time of the cryovac transaction 
the court also permitted new grace  which asserted that the cryovac transaction was not a fraudulent transfer  to intervene in the proceeding 
in july  the court issued an interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied in the trial  holding  among other things  that  subject to certain limitations  post claims should be considered in the solvency analysis of new grace 
the company believes that only claims and liabilities that were known or reasonably should have been known at the time of the cryovac transaction should be considered pursuant to the applicable standard 
the trial was scheduled to commence december  on november   the company reached an agreement in principle with the committees prosecuting the claims against the company and cryovac  inc  to resolve all current and future asbestos related claims arising from the cryovac transaction 
on the same day  the court entered an order confirming that an amicable resolution of the disputes among the parties had been reached and that counsel for the company and the committees had agreed and bound the parties to the terms of the agreement in principle 
as discussed above  the agreement in principle calls for payment of  shares of sealed air common stock and  in cash  plus interest on the cash payment at a annual rate starting on december  and ending on the effective date of the new grace plan of reorganization  when payment must be made 
such shares are subject to customary anti dilution provisions including the effects of stock splits  stock dividends and certain other events affecting the company s common stock 
pursuant to the agreement  the company cannot seek indemnity from new grace for this payment 
on december   the agreement in principle was approved by the company s board of directors 
the company was advised that both of the committees had approved the agreement in principle as of december  the parties are jointly engaged in the process of drafting a definitive settlement agreement consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle 
once signed by the appropriate parties  the settlement agreement will be presented to the court for approval and will eventually be incorporated into new grace s plan of reorganization and  assuming approval by new grace s creditors as part of the approval of the plan of reorganization  will then be implemented 
the settlement  upon approval and implementation in the new grace bankruptcy  will provide that  upon the effective date of new grace s plan of reorganization and payment of the shares and cash  all present and future asbestos related claims against the company and its affiliates that arise from alleged asbestos liabilities of new grace and its affiliates including former affiliates that became affiliates of the company through the cryovac transaction will be channeled to and become the responsibility of one or more trusts to be established as part of new grace s plan of reorganization 
the settlement will also resolve all fraudulent transfer claims against the company and its affiliates arising from the cryovac transaction as well as the claims of fresenius described below 
the settlement will provide that the company and its affiliates will receive releases of all such claims 
as a condition to the company s obligation to make the payments required by the settlement  new grace s plan of reorganization must be consistent with the terms of the settlement  including provisions for the trusts and releases referred to above and for an injunction barring the prosecution of any asbestos related claims against the company and its affiliates 
it is expected that the order approving the settlement agreement will also provide that the stay of proceedings involving the company described above will continue through the effective date of new grace s plan of reorganization  after which the company will be released from the liabilities asserted in those proceedings and their continued prosecution against the company will be enjoined 
in january  the company filed a declaratory judgment action against fresenius medical care holdings  inc  its parent  fresenius ag  a german company  and certain of its affiliates collectively  fresenius in new york state court asking the court to resolve a contract dispute between the parties 
fresenius contended that the company was obligated to indemnify fresenius for certain liabilities that fresenius might incur as a result of the fresenius transaction mentioned above 
fresenius s contention was based on its interpretation of the agreements between fresenius and w 
r 
grace co 
conn 
in connection with the fresenius transaction 
in february  fresenius announced that it had accrued a charge of  for such potential liabilities  which include pre transaction tax liabilities of new grace and the costs of defense of litigation arising from new grace s chapter filing 
the company believed that it was not responsible to indemnify fresenius under the agreements and filed the action in order to proceed to a resolution of fresenius s claims 
in april  fresenius filed a motion to dismiss the action and for entry of declaratory relief in its favor 
the company opposed the motion  and in june  the court reserved decision after oral argument 
no written order has been issued  and the parties have requested the court to defer issuing a ruling pending implementation of the definitive settlement agreement between the company and the committees 
as noted above  as a result of the november  agreement in principle referred to above  the parties expect that there will be mutual releases exchanged between fresenius and the company releasing any and all claims related to the fresenius transaction 
in view of new grace s chapter filing  the company may receive additional claims asserting that the company is liable for obligations that new grace had agreed to retain in the cryovac transaction and for which the company may be contingently liable 
to date  no material additional claims have been asserted or threatened against the company 
final determinations and accountings under the transaction agreements with respect to matters pertaining to the cryovac transaction had not been completed at the time of new grace s chapter filing 
the company expects to file a claim in the bankruptcy proceeding that will include all of the costs and liabilities that it has incurred or may incur that new grace agreed to retain or that are subject to indemnification by new grace under the transaction agreements other than payments to be made under the settlement agreement 
new grace alleges that the company is responsible for certain amounts under the transaction agreements 
any amounts for which the company may be liable to new grace may be used to offset new grace s liabilities to the company 
costs and liabilities for which the company intends to seek indemnification by new grace will also include certain defense costs related to asbestos and fraudulent transfer litigation and the fresenius claims  the guaranteed debt paid by the company described above  and any of the other potential claims against the company mentioned above 
except to the extent of any potential setoff or similar claim  the company expects that its claim will be as an unsecured creditor of new grace 
it is not currently possible to determine the amount of the company s claim against new grace  the extent to which such claim may be secured by setoff  how much of that claim may be allowed  or the amount of the company s recovery on such claim  if any  in the bankruptcy proceeding 
environmental matters the company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations  and it accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
these accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries  if any 
environmental liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated 
these liabilities are evaluated periodically based on available information  including the progress of remedial investigations at each site  the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties 
as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated  the company adjusts the recorded accruals  as necessary 
the company believes that such exposures are not material to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
the company believes that it has adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures

a fair value approach is used to test goodwill for impairment 
an impairment charge is recognized for the amount  if any  by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
an estimate of fair values for the company as a whole and each of the company s reporting units was derived by using discounted cash flows  equity market capitalization and comparative market multiples

amortization expense related to goodwill was  and  in and  respectively 
beginning january   in accordance with sfas no 
 the company is no longer recording amortization expense related to goodwill 
although goodwill will no longer be systematically amortized  this statement requires that periodic reviews be conducted to assess whether or not the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
such reviews could result in future write downs of goodwill which would be reflected as a charge against operating income

to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ from estimates  and any such differences may be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates 
commitments and contingencies litigation on an ongoing basis  the company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against the company 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions  the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
in assessing probable losses  the company makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries  if any 
the company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery  it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the company has previously made 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
a review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses  such as future cash flows and disposition costs  may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and possible impairment expense in the company s consolidated financial statements 
self insurance the company retains the obligation for certain claims and losses related to property  casualty  workers compensation and employee benefit claims 
the company accrues for outstanding reported claims  claims that have been incurred but not reported and projected claims based upon management s estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience  insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values 
although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments  it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities 
pensions although the company maintains a non contributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement savings plans in which most us employees of the company are eligible to participate  the company does maintain defined benefit pension plans for certain of its us and us employees 
the company accounts for such pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 

under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets 
certain of these assumptions include the discount rate used to measure future obligations  the expected future rate of return on plan assets  the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions 
changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on costs and liabilities recorded under sfas no 
income taxes the company s deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carryforwards 
the company believes that its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is provided 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable earnings  with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carryforwards  to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods  the company may need to adjust the valuation allowance  which could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements certain statements made by the company in this report and in the documents incorporated by reference herein  and in future oral and written statements by the company may be forward looking 
these statements include comments as to the company s beliefs and  expectations as to future events and trends affecting the company s business  its results of operations and its financial condition 
these forward looking statements are based upon management s current expectations concerning future events and discuss  among other things  anticipated future performance and future business plans 
forward looking statements are identified by such words and phrases as expects  intends  believes  will continue  plans to  could be  estimates and similar expressions 
forward looking statements are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties  many of which are outside the control of the company  which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements 
the company recognizes that it is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect the future performance of the company  such as economic  political  business and market conditions in the geographic areas in which it conducts business  the company s ability to hire  develop and retain talented employees worldwide  factors affecting the customers  industries and markets that use the company s packaging materials and systems  competitive factors  the company s development and commercialization of successful new products  the company s accomplishments in entering new markets and acquiring and integrating new businesses  changes in the company s relationships with customers and suppliers  acts and effects of war or terrorism  changes in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar  changes in interest rates  credit availability and ratings  the company s access to financing and other sources of capital  the success of the company s key information systems projects  the magnitude and timing of the company s capital expenditures  the company s inventory management proficiency  raw material availability and pricing  production capacity  changes in energy related expenses  the effect on the company of new pronouncements by accounting authorities  the approval and implementation of a definitive settlement agreement with the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants  the official committee of asbestos property damage claimants and any other appropriate parties in the new grace bankruptcy proceeding  other effects on the company of the bankruptcy filing by new grace and its subsidiaries  other legal proceedings and claims including environmental matters involving the company  the effects of animal and food related health issues including bse mad cow and foot and mouth  and changes in domestic or foreign laws or regulations  or governmental or agency actions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
the company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not purchase  hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rates from time to time  the company may use interest rate swaps  collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
during september  the company terminated certain interest rate swaps and reflected a basis adjustment to the senior notes for a portion of the cash received of approximately  such amount is being amortized and reflected as a component of interest expense over the remaining life of the senior notes 
at december  and  the company had no interest rate swaps  collars or options outstanding 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates 
generally  the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
at december   the carrying value of the company s total debt was  of which approximately  was fixed rate debt 
at december   the carrying value of the company s total debt was  of which  was fixed rate debt 
the estimated fair value of the company s total debt  which includes the cost of replacing the company s fixed rate debt with borrowings at current market rates  was approximately  at december  compared to  at december  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the total debt balance at december  of approximately  such changes in the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt do not alter the company s obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt 
foreign exchange rates the company may use other derivative instruments from time to time  such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps to gain access to additional sources of international financing while limiting foreign exchange exposure and limiting or adjusting interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency 
at december  and  the company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding 
the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
the terms of such instruments are generally twelve months or less 
at december  and  the company had foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of approximately  and  respectively 
the estimated fair values of these contracts  which represent the estimated net payments that would be paid or received by the company in the event of termination of these contracts based on the then current foreign exchange rates  were a net payable of approximately  and a net receivable of approximately  at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december  would have caused the company to pay approximately  to terminate these contracts 
the company s foreign subsidiaries had outstanding debt of approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
such debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary 
the company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  thereby reducing its need to enter into foreign exchange contracts 
commodities the company uses various commodity raw material and energy products in conjunction with its manufacturing processes 
generally  the company acquires such components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
as a result  the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components
