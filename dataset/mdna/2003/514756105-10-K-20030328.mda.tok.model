to accelerate the implementation of elements of our business  we may target and pursue strategic acquisitions and relationships  such as marketing alliances with vendors of complementary products and services and partnerships with internet providers of healthcare content  disease management and health related e commerce services 
investigating or entering into any such strategic relationships could lead to additional expenditures 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  restructuring costs  and goodwill and other intangible assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company has identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues consist of software license and implementation fees  related maintenance and software service fees  and care management programs 
deferred revenue consists of maintenance billings and annual enrollment fees due in advance of service periods 
from time to time  the company may enter into care management contracts that guarantee certain cost savings or other performance measures to the customer 
certain amounts are refundable to the customer if such savings or performance criteria are not achieved 
under such contracts  the company defers revenue equal to either the maximum potential amount of fees that are refundable  or such amount that is determined by management to be reasonable based on historical performance under the contract 
such revenue will not be recognized until the performance criteria have been met 
the company s revenue recognition policies are consistent with the guidance in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements and aicpa statement of position no 
software revenue recognition 
the company follows specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however certain estimates and judgments affect the application of the revenue policy 
these estimates include the estimated contract hours and time to complete for percentage of completion accounting  and the effort based measures used in services accounting 
changes in conditions or new contract terms could cause management to determine these estimates and judgments must be revised 
such changes or revisions could adversely affect the revenue recognition for any reporting period 
bad debt 
management analyzes accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms and trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debt 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for bad debt in any accounting period 
the accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for bad debt of million as of december  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to 
table of contents deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances for bad debt may be required 
goodwill 
we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on january  accordingly  we discontinued periodic amortization of goodwill of approximately  annually 
goodwill will be assessed annually on january for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
additionally  the standard requires a transitional impairment test during the period of adoption 
we have performed the transitional impairment test  which indicated that there is no impairment to goodwill as of january  the projections used to test for impairment of goodwill were based on management s estimate of future results 
the company will test its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
such tests will be based on revised estimates  and may result in future impairments to goodwill 
other intangible assets 
other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the asset  which is the period the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows 
other intangibles include customer relationships and acquired technology 
the lives established for our intangible assets are based on many factors  and are subject to change because of the nature of our operations 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or indicate that an impairment exists 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of  on our intangible assets 
our acquired workforce intangible asset was reclassified to goodwill upon the adoption of fas on january  restructuring costs 
the restructuring accrual is based on certain estimates and judgments related to contractual obligations and related costs 
potential restructuring accruals related to lease contractual obligations could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to secure subleases  the credit worthiness of subleases and our success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish additional restructuring accruals or reverse accrual amounts accordingly

the liability is accreted to its present value each period while the cost is depreciated over its useful life 
sfas no

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities

it nullifies the guidance of the emerging issues task force eitf in eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under eitf issue no 
 an entity recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date that the entity committed itself to an exit plan 
in fas  the board acknowledges that an entity s commitment to a plan does not  by itself  create a present obligation to other parties that meets the definition of a liability 
we will adopt this statement effective january  and we do not believe this will have a material affect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

the guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into fiscal years beginning after june  the issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
specifically  the issue addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one earnings process and  if it does  how to divide the arrangement into separate units of accounting consistent with the identified earnings processes for revenue recognition purposes 
the issue also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
we currently follow the appropriate pronouncement as discussed in revenue recognition and anticipate the issue to have no significant impact on the results of our operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation clarifies the requirements of sfas  accounting for contingencies  relating to guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
this interpretation is intended to improve the comparability of financial reporting by requiring identical accounting for guarantees issued with a separately identified premium and guarantees issued without a separately identified premium 
the interpretation s provisions for initial recognition and measurement are required on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of both interim and annual periods that ended after december  we have adopted the disclosure provisions of this interpretation  however  we have not yet determined the effects that this interpretation will have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

table of contents factors that may affect our future results we have a long history of losses and may never become profitable 
we have been in business since and we have incurred significant losses since that time 
we expect to continue to incur losses on an annual basis for the foreseeable future 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to incur increased levels of product development  sales and marketing and administrative expenses and  as a result  we will need to increase our revenue significantly to achieve future profitability 
although our revenue has grown in recent quarters  we may not be able to sustain this growth and we may not realize sufficient revenue to achieve profitability 
further  even if we achieve profitability  due to competition and the evolving nature of the disease management  medical management  healthcare information technology and internet markets  we could fail to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we have a history of quarterly and annual fluctuations in our revenue and operating results  and expect these fluctuations to continue  which may result in volatility in our stock price 
our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which we cannot control 
the factors that may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate include fluctuations in demand for our population health management products and related services  the ability of customers to provide us with the names of qualified members to enroll in our managing for tomorrow member driven chronic condition management program  the timing of customer orders and product implementations  particularly orders from large customers involving substantial software implementation  the length of our sales cycle  which varies and is unpredictable  the length of our software implementation process varies and often depends on matters outside of our control such as the customer s ability to commit its resources to the implementation process  our ability to develop  introduce  implement and support new products and product enhancements  the rate of adoption of our population health management solutions  which often require our customers to change some aspects of the way in which they have traditionally conducted business  announcements and new product introductions by our competitors and deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products  services or product enhancements introduced by us or our competitors  and changes in the prices at which we can sell our population health management solutions 
accordingly  you should not rely on the results of any past periods as an indication of our future performance 
in some future periods  our operating results may not meet expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  our stock price may decline 
our business will suffer if our population health management solutions do not achieve widespread market acceptance among healthcare payer organizations 
achieving our growth objectives depends on our population health management solutions achieving widespread market acceptance among healthcare payer organizations 
this is difficult to determine at this time 
we commercially released our maxmc medical management software in and acquired the predictive modeling applications and services  and chronic condition management programs in the fourth quarter of our solutions currently have limited market acceptance with only payer customers currently using them 
our maxmc medical management software product has achieved a modest degree of market acceptance as we have implemented or are in the process of implementing it at client sites 
realizing market acceptance for our care management solutions will require ongoing enhancement of their 
table of contents features and functionalities  and improved sales and marketing efforts 
if we do not gain significant market share for all of our population health management solutions before our competitors introduce alternative products with features similar to ours  our operating results will suffer 
operating results will also suffer if our pricing strategies are not economically viable or acceptable to our customers 
the healthcare industry may not accept our population health management solutions 
to be successful  we must attract as customers a significant number of healthcare payer organizations  and continue to attract hospitals and healthcare delivery organizations 
we cannot determine the extent to which the payer market will accept either our care management or medical management solutions as substitutes for traditional methods of intervening with members with chronic health conditions or processing healthcare information and managing patient care 
to date  many healthcare industry participants have been slow to adopt new disease management methodologies and medical management technology solutions 
we believe that the complex nature of healthcare processes and communications among healthcare industry participants  as well as concerns about confidentiality of patient information  may hinder the development and acceptance of our population health management solutions 
in addition  customers that are already engaged in disease management programs or have implemented information systems in which they have made significant commitments may refuse to adopt our solutions if they perceive that our solutions will not complement their existing investments 
as a result  the conversion from traditional methods of disease management and communication to electronic information exchange may not occur as rapidly as we expect it will 
even if these conversions do occur as rapidly as expected  payers and providers may use solutions  products and services offered by others 
because we offer a limited number of products and operate exclusively in the population health management solutions market  we are particularly susceptible to competition  product obsolescence and market downturns 
we depend on a limited number of products and we operate exclusively in the disease management and medical management solutions markets 
prior to our acquisitions of predictive modeling and chronic condition management products  we derived substantially all of our revenue from the sale and associated support of maxsys ii and its predecessor maxsys i  maxmc  a medical management software solution marketed to hospitals  healthcare delivery organizations and health insurance companies 
we anticipate that we will continue to generate revenue from the continued sales and support of medical management software solutions 
with the acquisitions of care management solutions  we have increased our product offering  but it is still limited 
dependence on this limited product line makes us particularly susceptible to the successful introduction of  or changes in market preferences for  competing products 
in addition  operating exclusively in the market for population management solutions make us particularly susceptible to downturns in that market that may be unrelated to the quality or competitiveness of our solutions 
we currently depend on a limited number of key customers and the loss of any of them  or any future customer on whom we may depend for a significant portion of our sales  could significantly reduce our revenues and negatively impact our results of operations  our stock price and our future viability 
we currently serve a limited number of customers  two of whom accounted for and  respectively  of our revenues for the twelve month period ended december  moreover  because we focus our sales efforts on a small group of potential customers in the healthcare industry we anticipate our operating results will continue to depend on sales to a small number of key customers for the foreseeable future 
the loss of  or a reduction in sales to  any of our current customers or our failure to sell our products and services to additional customers would significantly reduce our future revenues and negatively impact our results of operations  our stock price and our future viability 

table of contents we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers 
due to the current slowdown in the economy  the credit risks relating to our customers have increased 
although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risk  there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 
we have experienced losses due to customers failing to meet their obligations 
although these losses have not been significant  future losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial conditions 
if we do not hire and retain additional sales  marketing and implementation personnel we may not succeed in implementing our growth strategy and achieving our target revenue growth 
our future growth depends to a significant extent on our ability to hire additional sales  marketing and implementation personnel 
competition for these people is intense 
we have experienced difficulty in hiring qualified sales and marketing professionals  as well as database administrators  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such individuals 
if we do not hire additional qualified sales and marketing personnel  we may not succeed in implementing our growth strategy and our targeted revenue growth may not be achieved 
in addition  even if our sales increase  our market penetration and revenue growth will be limited if we are unable to hire additional personnel to implement the medical management solutions we sell 
we also believe that our success depends to a significant extent on the ability of our key personnel to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
many of our employees have only recently joined us  and we may experience high turnover rates in some categories of personnel 
if we do not assimilate new employees in a timely and cost effective manner  the productivity of those employees will be low  and as a result our operating results may decrease 
in addition  companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that their competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
competitors or other companies may make such claims against us in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel 
any claim of this nature could result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims  regardless of their merits 
our future success depends in significant part upon the continued service of our management team 
we have recently experienced significant changes in our senior management  which may be disruptive to our business and may result in the departure of employees and or customers 
our management team has a great deal of experience in the software  medical management software and healthcare information technology industries in general and in the market for population health management solutions  in particular 
while our management is relatively inexperienced in the disease management industry  which is a relatively new market  they are uniquely qualified to manage our business and would be difficult to replace 
these employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time 
the search for a replacement for any of our key personnel could be time consuming  and could distract our management team from the day to day operations of our business 
this could delay the implementation of our growth strategy and negatively impact our ability to achieve targeted revenue growth 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on our key personnel 
the length and complexity of our sales cycle and product implementation period may cause us to expend substantial time  effort and funds without receiving related revenue 
we do not control many of the factors that influence our customers buying decisions and the implementation of our population health management solutions 
the sales and implementation process for our solutions is lengthy  particularly for our medical management software products  and involves a significant technical evaluation and requires our customers to commit considerable time and money 
the sale and implementation of our solutions are subject to delays due to healthcare payers and providers internal budgets and procedures for approving large capital expenditures and deploying new technologies and methodologies within their organizations 
the sales cycle for our solutions is unpredictable and has generally ranged from six to twenty four months from initial contact to contract signing 
the time it takes to implement our medical 
table of contents management software solutions is also difficult to predict and has typically ranged from six to fifteen months from contract execution to the commencement of live operation 
during the sales cycle and the implementation period  we may expend substantial time  effort and money preparing contract proposals  negotiating the contract and implementing the solution without receiving any related revenue 
our care management solutions depend on accurate member data provided by the client  which must be received on a timely basis in order for us to fulfill our obligations 
our care management solutions rely on claims data such as medical claims  prescription data  member contact information  ur data and lab data for the client to identify and target for intervention members at risk 
the inability of a customer to provide this information on a timely basis or the delivery of inaccurate or incorrect data could have an impact on our ability to fulfill customer obligations and deliver guaranteed savings and  therefore  achieve revenue expectations from particular contracts 
our managing for tomorrow chronic condition management programs rely on complex  proprietary technology  the malfunctioning of which could delay or impede the realization of revenue 
our managing for tomorrow programs rely on the engagement in the program of members targeted by a health plan or other payer organization 
in order to fulfill our customer obligations  we rely on an automated system that uses sophisticated technologies and data management processes to contact  profile  stratify and intervene with these members with customized self management materials 
additionally  this system automates workflow  and monitors and reports on results of the program 
our telecommunications hardware and a significant portion of our data systems reside at an offsite data center owned by a co location and managed hosting service 
the co location and managed hosting industry is experiencing a severe economic downturn  which could effect our co location and managed hosting service provider 
if our service provider were to curtail or close its business our access to our telecommunications hardware  systems and data could be interrupted until we can make co location arrangements with a new service provider 
any such interruption or other malfunctions  system downtime or software errors could impede our ability to realize anticipated revenue  lead to an increase in our costs  adversely effect our relationship with our customers  and potentially expose us to liability 
we enter into chronic condition management contracts that provide guaranteed levels of performance to our customers  and we may be required to refund to customers a significant portion of the subscription fees paid to us if we fail to achieve the guaranteed performance criteria 
from time to time  the company may enter into chronic condition management contracts pursuant to which we guarantee certain minimum levels of cost savings or other performance measures to the customer 
under such contracts  we often agree to reimburse all or a portion of the enrollment fees paid to us by the customer if we fail to achieve such minimum cost savings 
due to the large number of variables  many of which are not within our control  that could impact the realization of such minimum cost savings  there can be no assurance that we will achieve such savings 
if we do not achieve the necessary cost savings we may be obligated to reimburse significant portions of the enrollment fees paid to us by customers  we will not recognize the revenue associated with such fees and our business and reputation may be harmed 
as of december   we had two contracts that contain some level of performance guarantee 
as of december  we had deferred revenue of approximately  related to performance guarantees 
our medical management solutions are complex and may contain undetected software errors  which could lead to an increase in our costs or a reduction in our revenues 
complex software products such as our medical management solutions frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have  from time to time  found errors in our software products  and in the future we may find further errors 
in addition  we combine our solutions with software and hardware products from other vendors 
as a result  we may experience difficulty in identifying 
table of contents the source of an error 
the occurrence of hardware and software errors  whether caused by our solutions or another vendor s products  could impair market acceptance of our products  cause sales of our solutions to decrease and our revenues to decline  cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our technical personnel away from product development efforts  and cause significant customer relations problems 
because our population health management solutions rely on technology that we own  our business will suffer if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights to that technology against infringement by competitors 
to protect our intellectual property rights  we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our solutions is difficult and the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property from infringement  other companies may use our intellectual property to offer competitive products at lower prices 
if we fail to compete effectively against these companies we could lose customers and sales of our solutions and our revenue could decline 
efforts to protect our intellectual property or our alleged misuse of the intellectual property of others may cause us to become involved in costly and lengthy litigation 
although we are not currently involved in any intellectual property litigation  we may be a party to litigation in the future either to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property of others 
these claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability or invalidate our ownership rights in the technology used in our solutions 
litigation  regardless of the merits of the claim or outcome  could consume a great deal of our time and money and would divert management time and attention away from our core business 
any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following stop using the challenged intellectual property or selling our products or services that incorporate it  obtain a license to use the challenged intellectual property or to sell products or services that incorporate it  which could be costly or unavailable  and redesign those products or services that are based on or incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which could be costly and time consuming or could adversely affect the functionality and market acceptance of our products 
if we must take any of the foregoing actions  we may be unable to manufacture and sell our solutions  which would substantially reduce our revenue 
we face significant competition from  among others  disease management vendors  medical management software vendors  internet companies and consulting groups focused on the healthcare industry 
we face intense market competition for our population health management solutions 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than we have 
because these organizations may be better known and have more customers than us  we may not compete successfully against them 
the principal companies we compete against in the disease management market include american healthways  corsolutions  lifemasters and matria healthcare 
our principal 
table of contents competitors in the medical management software payer market include hpr a subsidiary of mckesson hboc  medecision  and others 
in the healthcare delivery segment of the medical management software market  we compete against mids a division of affiliated computer systems  inc  softmed systems and others 
we expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in the internet  information technology and healthcare industries 
rapidly changing technology may impair our ability to develop and market our population health management solutions 
because our business relies on technology  it is susceptible to rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions  and evolving industry standards 
in particular  the internet is evolving rapidly and the technology used in internet related products changes rapidly 
as the internet  computer and software industries continue to experience rapid technological change  we must quickly modify our solutions to adapt to such changes 
the demands of operating in such an environment may delay or prevent our development and introduction of new solutions and additional functions for our existing solutions that must continue to meet changing market demands and keep pace with evolving industry standards 
moreover  competitors may develop products superior to our solutions  which could make our products obsolete 
our customers may encounter system delays  failures or loss of data when using our internet based medical management solution and internet capabilities of our chronic condition management products and services as a result of disruptions or other problems with internet services and internet access provided by third parties 
system delays  failures or loss of data experienced by our customers could harm our business 
the success of our internet based medical management solutions and chronic condition management capabilities depend on the efficient operation of internet connections among our payer customers and their members and associated providers  and with us 
these connections  in turn  depend on the efficient operation of internet service providers  internet connections and web browsers 
in the past  internet users have occasionally experienced difficulties with internet connections and services due to system failures 
any disruption in internet access provided by third parties could delay or disrupt the performance of our internet based solutions  and consequently  make them less acceptable to payers 
furthermore  we will depend on our customers hardware suppliers for prompt delivery  installation and service of the equipment that runs our applications 
security breaches and security concerns about internet transmissions may cause customers to refuse to purchase or discontinue the use of our population health management solutions 
our customers will retain confidential customer and patient information using our solutions 
an experienced computer user who is able to access our customers computer systems could gain access to confidential patient and company information 
therefore  our products must remain secure and the market must perceive them as secure 
the occurrence of security breaches could cause customers to refuse to purchase or discontinue use of our solutions 
protecting against such security breaches or alleviating problems caused by security breaches may require us to expend significant capital and other resources 
in addition  upgrading our systems to incorporate more advanced encryption and authentication technology as it becomes available may cause us to spend significant resources and encounter costly delays 
concerns over the security of the internet and other online transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the market for our internet based population health management solutions 

table of contents we operate in an industry subject to changing regulatory influences  which could limit the usefulness of our solutions or require us to make expensive and time consuming modifications to our products 
during the past several years  federal  state and local governments have increased their regulation of the us healthcare industry and have proposed numerous healthcare industry reforms 
these reforms may increase governmental involvement in healthcare  continue to reduce reimbursement rates and otherwise change the operating environment for our customers 
our customers may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding the proposals by curtailing or deferring investments  including those for our medical management solutions 
existing state and federal laws regulate the confidentiality of healthcare information and the circumstances under which such records may be released 
congress is considering further legislation and the department of health and human services has proposed regulations that would further regulate the confidentiality of healthcare information 
in addition  the department of health and human services has proposed regulations setting forth security standards for all health plans  clearinghouses and providers to follow with respect to healthcare information that is electronically transmitted  processed or stored 
while these laws and regulations may not apply to us directly  our products must comply with existing and future laws and regulations in order to achieve market acceptance 
such compliance may be difficult and expensive or even impossible to achieve 
these laws or regulations could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain  use or disseminate patient information  which in turn could limit the usefulness of our medical management solutions causing a decrease in our sales 
because of the internet s popularity and increasing use  new laws and regulations with respect to the internet are becoming prevalent 
such new laws and regulations could limit the effectiveness and market acceptance of our internet based solutions or could cause us to have to modify our solutions  which could be expensive and time consuming 
our population health management solutions will have to contain hipaa compliant features and functionality to remain marketable 
these new regulations are proposed and may be modified prior to becoming final 
our products may require modification in the future 
any such modification could be expensive  could divert resources away from other product development efforts or could delay future releases or product enhancements 
if we fail to offer solutions that permit our customers to comply with applicable laws and regulations our business will suffer 
consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to large integrated healthcare delivery systems that may use their enhanced market power to force price reductions for our population health management solutions and related services 
many healthcare industry participants are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power 
as the healthcare industry consolidates  competition to provide products and services to industry participants will become more intense and the importance of establishing relationships with large industry participants will become greater 
these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
our operating results may suffer if we reduce our prices without achieving corresponding reductions in our expenses 
we may encounter acquisition related risks such as becoming responsible for unexpected liabilities of acquired businesses and difficulties integrating employees and operations of acquired businesses 
we may review opportunities to acquire other businesses or technologies 
in connection with acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  or 
table of contents assume liabilities 
acquisitions could involve numerous risks  including problems integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs or unexpected liabilities  diversion of our management s attention from our core business  interference with existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might purchase in the future 
our principal stockholders have significant voting power  which may limit our stockholder s ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other stockholder matters 
our executive officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  which could delay or prevent an outside party from acquiring or merging with us 
due to our limited funds  we may be unable to develop or enhance our population health management solutions  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated events 
our funds are limited 
they consist of the net proceeds of our initial public offering  together with other cash and cash equivalents and limited anticipated cash flow from operations 
we believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating expense requirements for the next twelve months 
thereafter  we may require additional funds to support our working capital and operating expense requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings if such funding is available on terms acceptable to us 
however  if we are not able to sign one or more of the contracts presently in negotiations  we may need to seek a strategic partner or raise additional funds subsequent to december  if we cannot raise capital on acceptable terms and when needed  we may not have the resources to develop new products or enhance existing products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated events 
we have experienced over million in impairments of our fixed and intangible assets since the first quarter of  and our assets may continue to become additionally impaired in the future 
during the first quarter of  we recorded an impairment of intangible assets in the amount of  in connection with the cessation of operations of our web consulting business 
during the second quarter of  primarily due to a decline in demand for services in the company s care management reporting unit  management determined that it was necessary to test for an impairment of long lived assets 
as a result of this test and the subsequent analysis of the fair value of its care management reporting unit  landacorp recorded an impairment to its long lived assets in the amount of  during the second quarter of in accordance with the provisions of sfas and  we will continue to evaluate the fair value of our reporting units and the recoverability of the assets contained therein 
the impairments recorded during the quarter ended march  and the quarter ended june  were based on assumptions that reflected management s estimate of future results 
however  such estimates may need to be revised in future periods  which could result in additional impairment charges 

table of contents our stock price has been highly volatile  and your investment could suffer a decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  failure to achieve  or changes in  financial estimates by securities analysts  announcements of new products or services or technological innovations by us or our competitors  conditions or trends in the healthcare industry  announcements by us of significant strategic transactions or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of our common stock  and developments regarding our intellectual property or that of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq smallcap market and the market for technology companies in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
further  there has been particular volatility in the market prices of securities of healthcare services and software companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources 
there may not be an active  liquid trading market for our common stock 
as of the opening of trading on november   our common stock has traded on the nasdaq stock market s smallcap market 
there is no guarantee that an active trading market for our common stock will be maintained on the nasdaq smallcap market 
you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our stock is not active 
we are currently not in compliance with the minimum requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
in addition  the nasdaq recently proposed certain rule changes which  if adopted in their current form  may require us to make significant changes to the membership of our board of directors and audit committee 
if our stock continues to trade below the minimum bid price per share  or if we were to be unable to comply with the continued listing criteria or other requirements within the time frame prescribed by the nasdaq  we could be delisted from trading on such market  and thereafter trading in our common stock  if any  would be conducted through the over the counter market or on the electronic bulletin board of the national association of securities dealers  inc item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while  at the same time  maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality money market accounts that invest in debt securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we invest in money market accounts that are highly liquid 
as a result  we do not believe we are subject to significant rate risk
