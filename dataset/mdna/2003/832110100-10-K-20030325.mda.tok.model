item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to assist readers in understanding the company s financial performance during the periods presented and significant trends which may impact the future performance of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
the company manufactures and markets premium products and services to the oil and gas exploration and production and petrochemical industries and other industrial markets 
the company s worldwide operations are largely driven by the level of exploration and production activity in major energy producing areas and the depth and drilling conditions of these projects 
drilling activity levels are primarily influenced by energy prices but may also be affected by expectations related to the worldwide supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  finding and development costs  decline and depletion rates  political actions and uncertainties  environmental concerns  capital expenditure plans of exploration and production companies and the overall level of global economic growth and activity 
the company s current year results are expected to be influenced by the anticipated five percent to ten percent increase in average worldwide activity levels during and  to a lesser extent  the acquisition of the oilfield chemical business of dynea international  which was completed subsequent to year end 
the majority of the year over year increase in drilling activity is expected to be reported in north america 
drilling activity in the united states and canada is heavily influenced by natural gas fundamentals  as over percent of the north american rig count is currently natural gas directed 
natural gas storage levels in the united states  which were in excess of the historical five year average throughout most of  have recently been reduced due to a combination of declining production and higher weather related demand 
over the past twelve months  us natural gas storage levels have declined close to percent  which has contributed to average natural gas prices increasing nearly threefold 
although  to date  exploration and production companies have not committed significant capital for new drilling programs  management believes operators will increase spending throughout due to the favorable commodity price environment and the reduction in us natural gas supplies 
drilling activity in markets outside of north america  which is primarily influenced by crude oil fundamentals  has remained relatively consistent throughout and is not forecasted to increase significantly in while worldwide activity levels are currently above the average reported in  various factors  including political and regional instabilities  oil and natural gas storage levels  commodity prices and depletion rates  will likely influence drilling activity on a going forward basis 
the company s business outlook is highly dependent on the general economic environment in the united states and other major world economies  which ultimately impact energy consumption and the resulting demand for our products and services 
further weakness in the global economic environment could result in a substantial decline in worldwide drilling activity  adversely impacting the company s future financial results 
management also believes the increasing complexity of drilling programs has resulted in a shift in exploration and production spending toward value added  technology based products  which reduce operators overall drilling costs 
the company continues to focus on investing in the development of technology based products that considerably improve the drilling process through increased efficiency and rates of penetration and reduced formation damage 
management believes the overall savings realized by the use of the company s premium products  such as polycrystalline diamond drill bits  diamond enhanced three cone drill bits and synthetic drilling fluids  compensate for the higher costs of these products over their non premium counterparts 
forward looking statements this discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of concerning  among other things  the company s outlook  financial projections and business strategies  all of which are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
these forward looking statements are identified by their use of terms such as expect  anticipate  believe  estimate  project and similar terms 
the statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the company that it believes are appropriate under the circumstances 
such statements are subject to general economic and business conditions  industry conditions  changes in laws or regulations and other factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should the assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary 
results of operations segment discussion the company markets its products and services throughout the world through four business units which are aggregated into two reportable segments 
the oilfield products and services segment consists of three business units m i  smith bits and smith services 
the distribution segment includes the wilson business unit 
the revenue discussion below has been summarized by business unit in order to provide additional information in analyzing the company s operations 
dollars presented below are in thousands 
for the years ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent revenues m i    smith bits    smith services    oilfield products and services    wilson    total    revenues by area united states    canada    non north america    total    operating income oilfield products and services 
   distribution    general corporate    total    m i average worldwide rig count united states   canada non north america  total    not meaningful oilfield products and services segment revenues m i provides drilling and completion fluid systems  engineering and technical services to the oil and gas industry through its m i fluids division 
m i s swaco division manufactures and markets equipment and services for solids control  separation  pressure control  rig instrumentation and waste management 
m i s business operations are largely influenced by the number of offshore drilling programs  which are more revenue intensive than land based projects due to the complex nature of the related drilling environment 
m i reported revenues of billion for the year ended december   a decline of four percent from the prior year period 
excluding the impact of acquired operations  revenues were ten percent below the prior period and compared to an percent decline in the average m i worldwide rig count 
the majority of the base revenue decline was attributable to the lower number of land based drilling programs in the western hemisphere markets  primarily the united states  argentina and venezuela 
lower sales of synthetic drilling fluids  related to a percent reduction in the average number of us offshore drilling projects  accounted for the remainder of the year to year variance 
m i s revenues of billion were percent above the amount reported in the revenue growth was attributable to a percent increase in worldwide drilling activity and  to a lesser extent  acquisitions and improved pricing 
after excluding the effect of acquired operations  m i s revenues were percent above the prior year level with revenue growth reported in all geographic regions 
the majority of the base business revenue expansion was reported in the united states and europe africa due to higher demand for fluid products and fluid processing services 
smith bits designs  manufactures and sells three cone drill bits  diamond drill bits and turbines for use in the oil and gas industry 
prior to the transfer of its mining bit operations to an unconsolidated joint venture in october  smith bits also supplied drill bits to the mining and construction industry 
for the year ended december   smith bits revenues totaled million 
revenues for the smith bits unit  which due to the nature of its product offerings correlate more closely to the rig count than any of the company s other operations  were percent below the prior year and mirrored the decline in worldwide activity levels 
the majority of the revenue variance resulted from lower unit sales of three cone bits  reflecting the percent reduction in us drilling activity 
reduced activity levels in certain latin american markets  specifically colombia  argentina and venezuela  accounted for the remainder of the year to year variance 
smith bits revenues totaled million  a percent increase over the level 
excluding the impact of mining bit operations  revenues grew percent year to year and compared to a percent increase in the average worldwide rig count 
the majority of the base revenue growth was driven by increased drilling activity in the united states and europe africa and  to a lesser extent  the impact of improved pricing and market penetration 
smith services manufactures and markets products and services used in the oil and gas industry for drilling  workover  well completion and well re entry 
smith services reported revenues of million for the year ended december  revenues were comparable with amounts reported in the prior year period  as incremental revenues from acquired operations offset a percent decline in base business volumes 
the base revenue reduction primarily reflects the effect of a percent decline in north american activity levels  which impacted demand for drilling related products and services  including tubulars and inspection services 
smith services revenues totaled million  a percent increase over the level 
the significant revenue growth was attributable to higher worldwide activity levels and new contract awards 
smith services base revenues increased over levels in all geographic regions  with approximately two thirds of the improvement reported in the united states 
on a product basis  over percent of the revenue improvement was attributable to increased demand for drilling related products and services  including drill pipe  tubulars and inspection services 
operating income operating income for the oilfield products and services segment was million  a percent decline from the prior year period 
segment operating margins were percent for the year ended december   approximately three percentage points below the prior year s level 
the year over year decrease in segment operating income relates to decreased gross profit  primarily associated with lower sales volumes  as the company has experienced minimal pricing erosion to date 
to a lesser extent  decreased demand for higher margin products  specifically drill bits and premium drilling fluids which accounted for over three quarters of the revenue decline  contributed to the gross profit reduction 
segment operating expenses were comparable with the prior year  as the effect of lower employee profit sharing requirements and the elimination of goodwill amortization was offset by incremental expenses associated with acquired operations and higher costs incurred under medical and casualty insurance programs 
for the year ended december   segment operating income increased million above the previous year due to higher gross profit primarily associated with the percent revenue improvement  partially offset by higher variable based operating expenses 
segment operating margins increased to percent in  five percentage points above the prior year s level 
approximately three quarters of the year over year expansion in operating margins was attributable to improved gross profit margins  reflecting improved pricing and the leverage of higher volumes on the company s manufacturing and service infrastructure 
operating expenses  as a percentage of revenues  also declined from and accounted for the remainder of the margin expansion 
distribution segment revenues wilson markets pipe  valves  fittings and mill  safety and other maintenance products to energy and industrial markets  primarily through an extensive network of supply branches concentrated in the united states and canada 
the segment has the highest north american revenue exposure of any of the company s operations  with percent of wilson s revenues generated in those markets 
for the year ended december   distribution revenues were million  a percent decline from the prior year s level 
over percent of the revenue variance was reported in the energy branch operations related to a combination of lower north american drilling and completion activity and reduced canadian tubular product sales due to increased competition from steel mills 
lower spending for major maintenance programs and projects by customers in the us industrial and petrochemical markets contributed to the remainder of the segment s revenue variance 
wilson s revenues totaled billion in  an increase of percent from the van leeuwen operations  which were acquired in january  contributed approximately two thirds of the year over year revenue growth 
the majority of the eight percent increase in base business revenues was reported in the us energy branch operations  which benefited from higher customer spending on exploration and production programs and line pipe projects 
operating income distribution segment operating income declined million from the amounts reported in the operating income variance reflects lower gross profit associated with the reported revenue decline  partially offset by a reduction in variable based operating expenses 
as a percentage of sales  operating income decreased two percentage points from the prior year  as lower sales volumes impacted coverage of fixed sales and administrative support costs 
wilson s operating income of million was million above the level reported in operating income approximated two percent of revenue in  slightly above the level due to the impact of the revenue growth on coverage of sales and administrative support expenses 
gross profit margins were consistent with the prior year  with an improvement in gross margins in the us energy branches offset by the effect of a higher proportion of industrial and downstream revenues  which traditionally generate lower gross profit margins 
for the periods indicated  the following table summarizes the results of operations of the company and presents these results as a percentage of total revenues dollars in thousands for the years ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent revenues    gross profit    operating expenses    operating income    interest expense  net    income before income taxes and minority interests    income tax provision    income before minority interests    minority interests    net income    versus consolidated revenues were billion  percent below the prior year s level 
the majority of the revenue reduction was reported in the company s distribution operations  which are concentrated in north america and were impacted by the significant decline in corresponding activity levels

base revenue growth in the eastern hemisphere markets  attributable to increased activity levels and new contract awards  served to partially offset the overall revenue decline 
gross profit was million  percent below the prior year period 
the decrease in gross profit reflects lower sales volumes associated with the reduction in worldwide activity levels and  to a lesser extent  decreased demand for higher margin oilfield segment products 
gross profit margins for the year were percent of revenues  comparable with the prior year period 
an increased proportion of oilfield segment revenues in  which generate higher gross profit margins than the distribution operations  served to mask the margin deterioration reported in the oilfield segment 
operating expenses  consisting of selling  general and administrative expenses  decreased million from the prior year amount 
the operating expense decline was attributable to cost reduction efforts initiated in response to the decrease in western hemisphere activity levels  lower employee profit sharing requirements and the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with sfas no 
incremental expenses from acquired operations and the increased cost of medical and casualty insurance programs served to partially offset the overall expense decline 
as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses increased two percentage points  reflecting lower fixed cost coverage related to the overall sales and administrative functions in both of the company s operating segments 
net interest expense  which represents interest expense less interest income  decreased million from the prior year 
the minimal increase in average debt levels  primarily related to financing acquisitions in the fourth quarter of the prior year  was more than offset by the impact of reduced short term interest rates on the company s variable rate debt 
the effective tax rate approximated percent  which was below both the percent effective rate reported in the prior year and the us statutory rate 
the effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate due to the impact of m i s us partnership earnings for which the minority partner is directly responsible for its related income taxes 
the company properly consolidates the pre tax income related to the minority partner s share of us partnership earnings but excludes the related tax provision 
the effective tax rate declined one percentage point from the prior year due to the elimination of goodwill amortization  a portion of which was not tax deductible  and a favorable shift in the geographic mix of pre tax income toward lower rate jurisdictions 
minority interests reflect the portion of the results of majority owned operations which are applicable to the minority interest partners 
minority interests totaled million in  a million reduction from the prior year 
the decrease reflects the lower profitability of the m i joint venture  partially offset by the impact of acquiring a majority interest in united engineering services llc in the fourth quarter of versus consolidated revenues were billion  percent above the prior year  with higher revenue reported across all operating units and geographic regions 
two thirds of the improvement was generated by the company s base operations 
the company reported organic revenue growth of percent from  comparing favorably to the percent increase in average worldwide drilling activity 
the majority of the consolidated base revenue growth was reported in the united states and europe africa 
the period to period increase in revenues was also attributable to acquired operations and  to a lesser extent  the impact of improved pricing and market penetration experienced in the company s oilfield operations 
gross profit was billion  percent in excess of the prior year due primarily to the higher reported revenue levels 
gross profit margins rose over two percentage points to percent of revenues in  reflecting the impact of price increases and higher sales volumes on fixed cost coverage in the oilfield products and services segment 
a higher proportion of oilfield segment revenues in  which generate higher gross profit margins than the distribution business  also favorably affected the overall percentage 
operating expenses increased million  or percent  from the amount reported in the majority of the overall increase in operating expenses was attributable to the expansion in base business volumes  which contributed to a percent increase in average personnel levels over incremental operating expenses associated with acquired operations contributed to the higher expense levels  to a lesser extent  accounting for approximately percent of the variance from the prior year 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined almost one percentage point from  reflecting higher fixed cost coverage related to the overall sales and administrative functions in both of the company s operating segments 
net interest expense increased million from average debt levels rose million year over year  reflecting borrowings necessary to finance acquisitions in the company s average borrowing rate declined approximately basis points in  partially offsetting the impact of the increase in average debt levels on the interest expense variance 
the effective tax rate approximated percent  which was below both the percent effective rate reported in the prior year and the us statutory rate

the effective tax rate declined from the prior year  primarily due to a favorable shift in the geographic mix of pre tax income toward lower rate jurisdictions 
minority interests reflect the portion of the results of majority owned operations which are applicable to the minority interest partners 
minority interests was million  an increase of million from reflecting primarily the improvement in profitability of the m i joint venture 
liquidity and capital resources general at december   cash and cash equivalents equaled million 
during  the company s operations generated million of cash flows  which is million above the amount reported in the improvement is related to the significant decline in north american drilling activity  which reduced working capital levels  particularly the required investment in accounts receivable and inventories 
in  cash flows used in investing activities totaled million  primarily attributable to capital expenditures and  to a lesser extent  amounts required to fund acquisitions 
during  the company invested million in property  plant and equipment  net of cash proceeds arising from certain asset disposals 
projected net capital expenditures for are expected to increase to approximately million  as higher drilling activity is expected to impact the level of investment in manufacturing and rental tool equipment 
capital spending in is expected to primarily consist of spending for routine additions of property and equipment to support the company s operations and maintenance of the company s capital equipment base 
in addition to the investment in capital equipment  the company funded four acquisitions during for cash consideration of million and purchased stock of a majority owned subsidiary totaling million 
cash flows from operations exceeded cash required to fund investing activities  resulting in repayments of million in outstanding indebtedness 
cash flows used in financing activities  which totaled million for  were also impacted by minority partner cash distributions of million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling million during the year 
the company s primary internal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations 
cash flow generated by operations is primarily influenced by the level of worldwide drilling activity  which affects profitability levels and working capital requirements 
capacity under revolving credit agreements is also available  if necessary  to fund operating or investing activities 
the company has various revolving credit facilities in the united states 
as of december   the company had million of capacity available under these facilities for future operating or investing needs

as of year end  the company was well within the covenant compliance thresholds under its various loan indentures  as amended  providing the ability to access available borrowing capacity 
management believes funds generated by operations  amounts available under existing credit facilities and external sources of liquidity will be sufficient to finance capital expenditures and working capital needs of the existing operations for the foreseeable future 
subsequent to december   m i acquired certain oilfield chemical assets of dynea international in exchange for cash consideration of million 
the transaction was funded with cash on hand and million of borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
management continues to evaluate opportunities to acquire products or businesses complementary to the company s operations 
additional acquisitions  if they arise  may involve the use of cash or  depending upon the size and terms of the acquisition  may require debt or equity financing 
the company has not engaged in off balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities  and the consolidation of the company s minority ownership positions would not result in an increase in reported leverage ratios

the company believes that it has sufficient existing manufacturing capacity to meet current demand for its products and services 
additionally  inflation has not had a material effect on the company in recent years and is expected to have a modest impact on the operations in the foreseeable future 
the company has generally been able to offset most of the effects of inflation through productivity gains  cost reductions and price increases 
contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies the following table summarizes the company s debt maturities and future minimum payments under non cancelable operating leases having initial terms in excess of one year in thousands operating debt lease period due maturities commitments total thereafter    in the normal course of business with customers  vendors and others  the company is contingently liable for performance under standby letters of credit and bid and performance bonds which totaled million at december  the amount primarily consists of a million standby letter of credit  supporting notes issued in conjunction with the acquisition of cleancut technologies  and various performance bonds  of which million expire in management does not expect any material amounts to be drawn on these instruments 
the company routinely establishes and reviews the adequacy of reserves for estimated future environmental clean up costs for properties currently or previously operated by the company 
although the company believes it is in substantial compliance with environmental protection laws  estimating the related liability is difficult considering the continual changes in environmental regulations and the potential identification of new sites 
in connection with most business acquisitions  the company obtains contractual indemnifications from the seller related to environmental matters 
these indemnifications generally provide for the reimbursement of environmental clean up costs incurred by the company for events occurring or circumstances existing prior to the purchase date  whether the event or circumstance was known or unknown at that time 
a substantial portion of the company s total environmental exposure is associated with its m i operations  which are subject to various indemnifications from former owners 
as of december   the company has established an environmental reserve of million 
this amount reflects the future undiscounted estimated exposure related to identified properties  without regard to indemnifications from former owners 
while actual future environmental costs may differ from estimated liabilities recorded at december   the company does not believe that these differences will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations  subject to the indemnifications in place 
in the event that i the parties providing the environmental indemnifications do not fulfill their obligations  and ii costs incurred to remediate the identified properties reach estimated maximum exposure limits  the company would be required to establish additional environmental reserves of up to million  impacting earnings and cash flows in future periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company extends credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
management regularly reviews outstanding receivables and provides for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established reserves  management makes judgments regarding the parties ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
the company has made significant investments in inventory to service its customers around the world 
on a routine basis  the company uses judgments in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management s estimates are primarily influenced by technological innovations  market activity levels and the physical condition of products 
changes in these or other factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
in certain cases  management has established reserves to reduce deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
the company records liabilities for environmental obligations when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
management s estimates are based on currently enacted laws and regulations 
as more information becomes available or environmental laws and regulations change  such liabilities may be required to be adjusted 
additionally  in connection with acquisitions  the company generally obtains indemnifications from the seller related to environmental matters 
if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their obligations  adjustments of recorded amounts may be required 
the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its business and operations 
the company retains a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retentions under self insurance programs 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported claims and provides for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
recent accounting pronouncements on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
provides updated guidance concerning the recognition and measurement of an impairment loss for certain types of long lived assets and modifies the accounting and reporting of discontinued operations 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations for the year ended december  on december   the company adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for retirement obligations and costs associated with tangible long lived assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations for the year ending december  from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb which are adopted by the company as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  management believes the impact of recently issued standards  which are not yet effective  will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption 
qualitative and quantitative market risk disclosures the company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note  financial instruments  for additional discussion of hedging instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes is managed through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and by entering into interest rate contracts  from time to time  on a portion of its long term borrowings 
the company had no interest rate contracts outstanding as of december  and at december   percent of the company s long term debt carried a variable interest rate 
management believes that significant interest rate changes will not have a material near term impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows 
the company s exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates is managed primarily through the use of forward exchange contracts 
these contracts increase or decrease in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of the underlying transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
all currency contracts are components of the company s hedging program and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
the terms of these contracts generally do not exceed two years 
as of december   the notional amounts of fair value hedge contracts and cash flow hedge contracts outstanding were million and million  respectively  and the fair value exceeded the notional amount of these contracts by million 
as of december   the notional amounts of fair value hedge contracts and cash flow hedge contracts outstanding were million and million  respectively  and the fair value exceeded the notional amount of these contracts by million 
in some areas  where hedging is not cost effective  the company addresses foreign currency exposure utilizing working capital management 
the company utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a percent confidence level 
the company s var computations are based on the historical price movements in various currencies a historical simulation during the year 
the model includes all of the company s foreign exchange derivative contracts 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of currency sensitive instruments  calculated using the var model  was not material to the company s financial position or results of operations
