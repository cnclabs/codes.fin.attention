company history srs labs was formed in in connection with the purchase of all rights and assets of various audio and speaker technologies from the hughes aircraft company hughes 
in august  we successfully completed an initial public offering  raising approximately million 
from the company s inception in until february  we derived substantially all of our revenues from audio technology licensing activities for the consumer electronics  computer and game markets 
on march   we acquired of the outstanding stock of valence technology inc a british virgin islands holding company ultimately succeeded by valence  which had its principal business operations and office locations in hong kong and the people s republic of china the prc 
this acquisition significantly expanded our business activities from the original licensing model to include the design  manufacture and marketing of custom asics  standard ics  components and products 
in addition to the acquisition of valence  during the fiscal year ended december   we acquired rights to two additional technologies  voice intelligibility processor vip  a patented voice processing technology that improves the intelligibility of the spoken voice  especially in high ambient noise environments  and circle surround  a patented audio delivery system that allows multichannel surround sound to be encoded into a two channel stereo format and allows an encoded two channel audio source to be decoded into a multichannel surround format 
formed during the fiscal year ended december   our srswowcast subsidiary was originally established as an entertainment portal with original internet programming  syndicated programming and as a demonstration platform for srs audio technologies 
in fiscal  we revised our business strategy to focus on the licensing of our audio and voice enhancement technology solutions for internet audio  online radio and traditional broadcast applications  such as television  radio  cable and satellite 
we market technology solutions and a line of hardware and software products that feature the core srs technologies 
consistent with the licensing trademark policy  we actively promote the use of our trademarks and logos and require that customers display the appropriate srs technology logo 
at december   srs labs owned approximately of the capital stock of srswowcast 
in february  srs labs completed an exchange offer with the minority shareholders of srswowcast  pursuant to which srs labs acquired all of the outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock of srswowcast in exchange for the issuance of shares of srs labs common stock 
as a result of the exchange offer  srswowcast became a wholly owned subsidiary of srs labs 
srs labs technology licensing description of business our technology licensing strategy continues to be the development and licensing of audio  voice and speaker technologies to product and semiconductor manufacturers  as well as software developers  in the consumer electronics  home theater  gaming  automotive  computer  internet  wireless and telecommunications markets around the world 
our strategy is to identify high growth markets  develop needed technology solutions and features  and work with semiconductor and platform partners to make these technologies widely available and easy to implement 
we believe that we will continue to strengthen our market position as a world leader in audio and voice technology by employing a strategy of providing a continuous stream of patented audio and voice technologies  enhancing relationships with existing licensees  and creating strong brand awareness in order to attract new licensees 
our technologies may be implemented in a variety of methods  including discrete analog components  chip modules  analog semiconductors  dsps and software 
these various implementation options offer our customers significant flexibility when incorporating our technologies into their products 
our license agreements typically have multi year terms and either require per unit royalty payments for all products implementing our technologies or provide for a fixed annual or quarterly royalty payment 
license agreements also specify the use of our trademarks and logos on the product  within the packaging and in the user s manual 
agreements also require our product review and approval to guarantee the quality of the technology implementation and the correct usage of our logos and trademarks 
we believe these terms ensure the quality and consistency of the technology and elevate the awareness of the srs brand in the marketplace 
most agreements do not have volume requirements and may be terminated by the licensees or the company without substantial financial penalty 
technology portfolio the portfolio of technologies that we have developed or acquired include a wide range of technology solutions for the enhancement of both mono  stereo and voice audio sources  the processing of voice to improve intelligibility and clarity  multichannel surround sound and speaker design applications 
the technologies described in detail below are marketed by srs under the following trademark names circle surround  circle surround ii  focus  srs  srs headphone  trubass  trusurround  trusurround xt  vip  and wow 
audio enhancement srs d sound srs d sound is one of the world s leading d audio enhancement technologies 
the patented technology broadens any mono or stereo audio signal and creates a realistic d sound image from just two standard stereo speakers 
srs d sound is based on the fundamentals of the human hearing system and recreates the multitude of spatial cues that are present in a live listening environment but are lost in recording and playback 
srs d sound dramatically widens the sweet spot associated with traditional stereo  therefore it does not require the listener to be positioned in a specific location to experience the immersive sound image 
srs d sound was originally developed by hughes  which spent significant resources to develop and patent srs d sound and related audio technologies 
since acquiring the srs d sound technology from hughes in june  srs labs has improved the performance of srs d sound  reduced the cost for oems to implement the technology  secured licensing relationships with various semiconductor manufacturers who offer the company s technology in various analog and dsp options and introduced the technology to a wider variety of consumer applications 
srs d sound can be applied to any consumer electronics product that includes mono or stereo audio playback through two speakers or headphones  including televisions  computers  audio receivers  car products  musical instruments  gaming products  powered speakers  portable and wireless audio products and mobile phones with audio playback 
srs headphone introduced in early  the patented srs headphone technology optimizes the core srs d sound technology for use with a standard pair of headphones or ear buds 
the process repositions the sound image from inside the listener s head to outside the listener s ears  creating a more natural listening situation 
sony currently features srs headphone in its portable cd dvd players 
wow wow is our next generation d audio enhancement for speakers and headphones and was introduced to the marketplace in november it is an award winning  patented  playback enhancement technology that improves the dynamics and bass performance of mono or stereo audio  especially when used with smaller speakers or headphones that are not capable of achieving a high fidelity experience  or when the audio has been digitally compressed into formats such as mp and windows media audio wma 
wow is an ideal audio solution for manufacturers of mobile or portable devices  in addition to products in which speakers are located close together  such as televisions 
hardware and software products that feature wow include mobile phones from sharp  microsoft s windows media player series software products  car cd receivers from kenwood  as well as televisions from sony and sharp 
to date  over million hardware or software products have been shipped or downloaded that include the powerful wow audio feature 
focus in many audio environments  speakers are not placed in the ideal location directly in front of a listener  which makes it difficult to achieve a realistic sound experience from speakers that are below the plane of the listener s ear 
we developed focus as a technology solution for this problem 
originally designed for use in automobiles where front speakers are often placed under the dashboard or facing each other in the door panels  the patented focus technology electronically repositions the sound image to create the appropriate perception of image height 
in addition to automobiles  focus is ideally suited for any product application where speakers cannot be placed in optimal locations for either space or aesthetic reasons  such as big screen or projection tvs  home in wall speakers and commercial applications 
products that feature focus include televisions from hitachi  thomson rca and pioneer 
trubass in we introduced trubass  a patented  psychoacoustic process that creates the perception of dramatically increased bass performance in smaller speaker systems and headphones far beyond the physical capabilities of the speakers themselves 
it is a dynamic technology that actively monitors the low frequency content of an audio signal and optimizes the frequency and amplitude spectrum of the output signal to enhance bass perception 
it effectively creates the impression of a subwoofer in smaller speaker systems and when used with a subwoofer  further increases the efficiency and overall performance of the bass response 
applications for this technology include any product with small and medium sized speakers or headphones  such as those found in televisions  radios  portable audio devices  boom boxes  games and smaller hand held devices 
trubass is an important part of the feature set for several of our technology solutions  including wow  csii and trusurround xt 
voice processing vip voice intelligibility processor our patented vip technology improves the intelligibility of the spoken voice especially in noisy environments 
it selectively processes only those spectral portions of the speech signal that the brain uses for cognition  without requiring an increase in gain or volume 
srs d sound inventor arnold klayman  who is now the principal audio scientist at srs labs  originally developed the vip technology at hughes 
during a divestiture in  hughes sold the vip technology to a third party that further developed and marketed the vip technology through a stand alone signal processor for use in the professional sound reinforcement industry 
as mentioned previously  we acquired the vip technology in the market opportunities for vip include cellular phones  wireless products  mission critical projects  hearing aids  public address and emergency warning systems  talking toys  hand free devices  voice over internet protocol voip  traditional and internet broadcasting and other voice related applications 
we directly offer both software and hardware implementation options for vip 
vip technology is available as digital code that may be ported to dsp platforms used by manufacturers of cellular phones  paging systems  digital televisions  sound reinforcement equipment and hearing aids 
vip is also available in software and can run on client or server side applications 
multichannel audio we offer a complete technology portfolio for home entertainment systems  including virtual surround sound for playback of multichannel audio material over two speakers  and an encode decode surround sound matrix technology that allows for the encoding of up to channels of audio and the decoding of up to channels of audio 
trusurround trusurround is our patented  virtual audio solution that solves the problem of playing multichannel content over two speakers 
it delivers a compelling  surround sound type experience through any two speaker playback system  including internal television speakers and headphones 
it is fully compatible with all multichannel formats up to channels 
virtual surround sound is increasingly becoming a standard feature for home theater products as the majority of television and dvd players are installed with only two speaker playback systems 
trusurround was specifically designed to solve this problem and present the multichannel audio content that is the standard for dvd movies over only two speakers 
the end result with trusurround is that the listener feels that they are surrounded with phantom speakers and presented with a virtual surround sound experience 
trusurround is also backward compatible with non surround encoded audio and delivers an immersive srs d audio experience from standard stereo sources 
trusurround has been adopted by many of the leading home theater manufacturers and has been included in millions of dvd players and televisions from accuphase  aiwa  emerson  funai  hitachi  hughes  marantz  mitsubishi  philips  pioneer  rca  sony  toshiba  yamaha and more 
trusurround xt based upon its patented predecessor and namesake  trusurround xt also solves the problem of playing multichannel content over two speakers or headphones but also utilizes proprietary algorithms to further enhance the playback experience 
playback of dialog in home theater environments often suffers due to competing signals from other speakers 
in addition  feature film content is mixed specifically for cinema playback 
when translated through home systems  dialog may become unintelligible or hard to understand 
our patented algorithm for dialog clarity srs dialog clarity enhances the voice to address these problems  thus improving dialog intelligibility 
our patented trubass technology is also included in trusurround xt 
similar to the original trusurround  trusurround xt is also backward compatible with non surround encoded audio  but taking trusurround a step further  it creates an immersive srs wow audio experience from either mono or stereo sources 
trusurround xt also includes a headphone mode  which provides a realistic virtual surround sound listening experience over headphones 
when listening to multichannel content over headphones  such as dvd movies  the listening experience is fundamentally different than listening to speakers 
since the headphone speaker drivers are covering the pinna of the ear  the listening experience differs greatly from traditional speaker playback 
trusurround xt utilizes patented headphone perspective curves to solve this problem and provides a non fatiguing  immersive  home theater listening experience 
trusurround xt headphone also delivers exceptional d audio from mono and stereo material 
trusurround xt was launched in november and is currently available on a variety of platform solutions from our semiconductor licensees 
end products with trusurround xt will begin to be introduced to consumers during fiscal year circle surround circle surround is an advanced  highly versatile  patented multichannel audio encode and decode system capable of supporting a wide range of surround sound creation and playback applications 
circle surround encoding provides the capability to encode up to channels of audio for transmission or storage over two output channels or standard two channel carriers 
it is backward compatible with most matrix decoders  such as dolby pro logic and dolby pro logic ii  with playback performance subject to the limitations of the specific decoder 
circle surround decoding is capable of delivering up to channels of audio from stereo  matrix encoded or circle surround encoded material  while its successor  circle surround ii  is an even more versatile multichannel decoder algorithm capable of delivering up to multichannel audio from mono  stereo  matrix encoded or circle surround encoded source material 
circle surround encoding can be used to broadcast television material  in the recording process for music or movies  or in the development of games for computers or video game consoles 
it can then be implemented in a decoding playback device  such as a home audio receiver  multimedia speakers  dvd player or car audio products 
circle surround has been adopted by many of the leading electronics companies as a surround decoding option  including kenwood  marantz  theta digital  accuphase  jaton  m audio  orion studios and smart devices 
in fiscal  srs labs demonstrated circle surround s encoding capabilities through a relationship with espn to telecast their national football league and national basketball association games  as well as other espn sporting events such as the x games  in circle surround technology 
under this agreement  the circle surround logo is displayed at the beginning and end of each circle surround encoded telecast 
circle surround ii circle surround ii features patented post processing techniques to enhance the multichannel audio experience and addresses problems that occur when playing back material mixed for cinema 
even in the finest home theater environments  dialog can often become difficult to understand 
srs labs dialog clarity solves this problem and significantly improves dialog intelligibility from all source material 
circle surround ii decoding also incorporates trubass technology to compensate for the use of small speakers or subwoofers 
trubass utilizes proprietary psychoacoustic techniques to restore the perception of low frequency fundamentals and enhance bass performance 
unlike circle surround  which creates up to channels of audio from only a stereo source  circle surround ii can create up to channels from a stereo or mono audio source  making it the most flexible and feature rich surround sound technology available on the market today 
circle surround ii has been introduced to our network of chip partners and we anticipate that we will announce several semiconductor solutions and licensed products featuring circle surround ii during fiscal vertical markets and oem licensees through our licensing business segment  we market our portfolio of technologies to the following vertical markets  home theater and consumer audio video  computer multimedia and internet  portable and wireless audio  voice communications and automotive 
home theater and consumer audio video home theater and consumer audio video products represent the largest current market for our technologies and have historically been the largest revenue contributor to the licensing segment 
this market is highly competitive and generally dominated by large multi national manufacturers 
product categories within this market  including dvd players  cable set top boxes and televisions  are among the fastest growing or highest volume in the electronics industry and represent a significant opportunity for our full portfolio of audio enhancement and surround sound technologies  including srs  wow  trusurround  trusurround xt  trubass  focus  circle surround and circle surround ii 
manufacturers in this market utilize our technologies to differentiate their products from their competitors and improve functionality and product performance 
our licensing relationships in this market include many of the leading global electronics manufacturers  who license multiple technologies from us for multiple product lines and divisions 
our strategy for this market remains to penetrate and expand 
we penetrate a new manufacturer and successfully license at least one of our technologies for a particular product line or division and then expand the usage of our technologies into various additional product lines and divisions 
for example  pioneer electronics first licensed our core srs d sound technology for use in mini systems and audio products in fiscal by the end of fiscal  pioneer s license had expanded to include focus  trusurround  trubass  wow and circle surround in a full range of products  including plasma television display sets  dvd players  audio video receivers and digital set top boxes 
computer multimedia and internet consumers are increasingly using computers and the internet for more than just word processing or business functions 
the majority of desktop computers and laptops incorporate a cd rom  dvd playback drive and speakers and typically support high resolution graphics  sound and voice communications 
the demand for these capabilities has been driven by the proliferation of multimedia based entertainment and video games  as well as the widespread use of the internet 
the personal computer and internet software and appliance market is characterized by intense pricing competition and  as a result  the oem hardware market is difficult to penetrate 
the software market  on the other hand  is being fueled by consumer s increasing use of a computer for playback of dvd movies 
this shift towards using a computer for more and more entertainment purposes has yielded opportunities for the license of our audio technologies to software developers 
during the second half of fiscal  we entered into licensing relationships with leading providers of software for the playback of dvds  including cyberlink  intervideo and orion studios 
as many of the srs technology software products were introduced late in the calendar year  no significant revenue was generated during fiscal  but we believe that this new phenomenon for dvd playback on a personal computer will yield additional opportunities during fiscal portable and wireless audio the use of portable audio products  such as boom boxes  headphone products and digital audio players  such as mp and portable cd players  is widespread  reflecting demand from consumers to take their music and video with them 
srs labs believes that several of its technologies  such as wow  trubass and srs headphone  are ideally suited to improve the sound quality of small speakers or headphones that are traditionally used in this market segment 
many of the manufacturers of portable audio products are based overseas and during fiscal  our licensing offices in korea  china and japan worked with leading manufacturers to create implementation solutions of our technologies for these mostly digital products 
our platform strategy of working with the leading semiconductor companies who supply the dsp chipsets for these products  such as texas instruments  motorola and philips semiconductor  creates opportunity to establish new licensing relationships which we believe will yield revenue in fiscal voice communications we continue to work with many of the leading mobile phone and voice communications companies  such as sharp  nec and j phone in japan  motorola in the united states and samsung in korea  to implement our voice technology solutions in communications products 
in japan and korea  mobile phones are becoming a true convergent product with voice communications capabilities  as well as the functionality of mp music playback and gaming 
as entertainment features become increasingly important for the mobile phone market  we believe that the voice communications products that traditionally were licensing opportunities for our vip voice technology only  can also support the license of our audio enhancement technologies  such as wow and srs headphone 
automotive consumers are also showing an interest in migrating the home entertainment experience to the road through rear seat video systems in automobiles using monitors built into headrests  the backs of driver seats  consoles and ceilings and through dvd players incorporated inside laptops 
this phenomenon is driving aftermarket suppliers to develop more entry level dvd systems for use in the automotive market  providing an opportunity for srs labs virtual surround sound technologies  trusurround and trusurround xt 
in addition  since wow includes srs d sound and elements of our repositioning technology  focus  it is ideally suited to enhance the audio quality of the traditional entertainment systems in automobiles  where speakers are not usually placed in optimal listening locations 
optimized for this special application  wow raises the sound image to a listener s ear and fills the automobile with sound 
during fiscal  kenwood corporation implemented wow for a new line of aftermarket car audio receivers 
gaming various srs technologies can be implemented inside a variety of hardware gaming applications  including  video and arcade games  portable game systems  accessory products and console game machines 
in addition  srs technology can be encoded directly into the game software thereby enhancing the quality of the audio track or providing multichannel audio playback 
srs labs has not derived significant licensing revenue from these market segments  but believes that its circle surround and trusurround technologies are well suited for use by gaming developers and gaming product manufacturers  including consoles and portable devices  to enhance the overall sound quality of the game or offer multi speaker surround sound or virtual surround sound through two speakers 
this market is highly competitive and subject to intense pricing pressure  as many of the hardware manufacturers continue to decrease their margin and profit and in some cases take a loss on the actual console itself  in order to stimulate sales of software titles 
we continue to believe that our technologies can add a significant functionality to the gaming market  but we have not generated any revenue from this market to date

by developing strong relationships with the leading software and semiconductor companies  our audio technologies can be delivered to customers worldwide across high growth and high volume product applications 
our licensing model most often employs a system where semiconductor manufacturers are recruited to build and sell semiconductor implementations that involve our technology solutions our chip partners 
under this system  revenue is not received directly from our chip partners 
we also enter into licensing arrangements with oems for the use of our technology solutions in consumer and other products manufactured by the oem 
our chip partners then sell these semiconductor technology solutions directly to the licensed oems 
under this licensing method  oem product licensees are free to choose a semiconductor solution from the srs chip partner that best suits their requirements and matches their price expectations 
we receive royalties directly from the licensed oem for the use of our technologies in licensed products manufactured and shipped by the oem 
many major oems have licenses for the use of one or more of our technologies and for the use and display of our trademarks 
the licensing methodology above is not well established in certain industries or in certain geographic regions such as the prc and india 
to address these market conditions  we implement an alternate royalty collection method  where the royalty is bundled into the cost of the semiconductor product and remitted directly to us from our chip partner when the semiconductor product is sold and shipped to the oem 
this system simplifies the business process for the oem  our chip partner and srs labs 
we determine which licensing model to follow based on factors involving mutual discussions with our chip partner and consumer product manufacturer  the particular market segment involved  the particular region where the products are manufactured and sold  and other factors 
our process for selecting particular chip partners and platforms for distributing our technology is based on several criteria including a segment leadership we target chip partners that hold preeminent positions in market segments characterized by high growth  volume and or margins  b volume platforms which will maximize exposure of our ip to a large number of potential oems  c synergy platforms which serve to position our ip along with compatible and additive technologies for integrated delivery  and d convergence potential which enable us to establish a presence on platforms that intersect merging functional features 
an example of this would be the platforms for new personal multifunctional devices that include cell phone  personal digital assistant pda and mp capabilities

we actively promote the use of our trademarks and logos and direct customers to prominently display the appropriate srs technology logo on products  packaging and in advertising 
we work closely with our licensees to enhance their success in selling finished products and semiconductor products that incorporate srs labs technologies through a variety of licensee support programs 
these programs include engineering support  sales training  tradeshow support  press support  customized marketing materials and corporate communications 
our corporate communications program includes press releases and corporate newsletter dissemination to our customers around the world  primarily through e mail 
we use the internet to provide easy to use audio technology demonstrations for those technologies that can be appropriately demonstrated on the world wide web 
we conduct in person technology demonstrations or presentations for the press and other companies to promote our technologies and products 
we also regularly participate in tradeshows and conferences to increase awareness of our technologies and to market our technologies and products 
we work closely with our licensees and chip partners to actively explore additional opportunities to place our technologies in new products and or markets 
srs labs products wow thing in fiscal  we developed our first srs branded  consumer audio product  the wow thing  which we marketed through our e commerce site  www 
wowthing 
com 
the wow thing is a small processor that can be installed between speakers or headphones and the sound card or cpu of most personal computer systems 
it enhances the sound quality of cds as well as digitally compressed audio  which is downloaded or streamed over the internet 
this product was our first entry into the highly competitive consumer market in the united states 
in fiscal  we reformatted the product packaging  created two separate models wow thing for computers and wow thing for game consoles  and marketed the two products online through our ecommerce site as well as to resellers 
during fiscal  we continued to market our remaining inventory to consumers online 
speakers in january  we unveiled a line of speakers based on proprietary flat panel designs and we are currently focused on building relationships in the retail network 
although revenues from these products have not been significant  the product group helps elevate awareness of the technology as well as create brand awareness with our customers and consumers 
we have taken a conservative approach in sales and marketing of these speakers in that we have not committed significant resources to the promotion of this product line  as we expect it will account for an insignificant portion of revenue for the year ended december  srswowcast through our srswowcast subsidiary  we develop  license and sell hardware and software products featuring srs audio technologies for the internet and broadcast markets 
during the fiscal year ended december   we established srswowcast as an entertainment portal with original internet programming  syndicated programming and as a demonstration platform for srs audio technologies 
in  we revised our business strategy in order to focus on the licensing of our audio and voice enhancement technology solutions for internet audio  online radio and traditional broadcast applications  such as television  radio  cable and satellite 
during fiscal  we concentrated on marketing circle surround technology to the broadcast and professional audio communities 
circle surround is an optimum surround encoding solution for television because it enables networks to encode up to channels of discrete audio material for transmission over the existing stereo production distribution infrastructure with no modifications 
in april  at the national association of broadcasters show  we demonstrated production prototypes of new circle surround encoder and decoder processors for the broadcast market 
throughout the year  we continued to work with many networks  such as espn  abc  and cbs  to implement on air tests of circle surround and conduct feasibility reviews of the new production hardware 
these tests were successful and by the end of  we announced that espn productions was the first network to use circle surround to deliver surround sound to its viewers around the world 
we did not generate significant revenue from the sale of professional hardware equipment in fiscal and the outlook for significant revenue generation remains unproven but an important element of our strategy for entering the broadcast and television recording market is leveraging of the srs brand name 
we require that the srs and circle surround logos are displayed at the beginning and the end of each circle surround encoded telecast 
this increased visibility to millions of television viewers continues to reinforce the branding of the srs name as a premier audio technology and provider 
valence description of business our hong kong based subsidiary  valence  is a semiconductor company that develops  designs and sells a variety of analog  digital  mixed signal and dsp digital signal processor asic application specific integrated circuits and ics standard integrated circuits 
these products address a wide range of applications in the consumer electronics  telecommunications  game  personal computer and internet appliance markets 
valence outsources the manufacturing of its semiconductors to third party manufacturers 
valence operates primarily in two areas the design and sale of custom asic and standard ic semiconductor solutions and the distribution of semiconductors and components 
consistent with our strategy to focus on high margin business opportunities  valence has been gradually phasing out the component distribution area of their business  which historically has provided significant top line revenue but very low margins 
concentrating sales  engineering and marketing efforts on the high margin custom semiconductor design and semiconductor sales businesses have contributed to a decrease in overall revenue but resulted in improved margins and financial performance 
design and sale of semiconductor solutions and ip licensing valence has over years of experience in the design and sale of asics and markets these products in two categories a custom asics for specific oem customers  and b standard ics marketed under their own brand name  asp microelectronics asp 
at the end of fiscal  approximately engineers support our asic design capabilities  which for the past six years have been awarded one of the hong kong industry s hkitcc technology achievement awards 
our custom asic customers include the asia based manufacturing facilities for consumer electronics  telecommunications  game and personal computer manufacturers headquartered in north america  europe and asia pacific 
due to nondisclosure agreements  specific customers cannot be disclosed  but under many of the design contracts  we have negotiated to retain ownership of the specific designs 
these designs form a significant library of intellectual property ip that can be utilized in future projects 
the majority of our ip design library includes the fundamental building blocks of a system on chip soc design 
the conversion of the many technologies and processes usually contained on an application board  such as gate arrays  ttls  roms  rams  analog to digital converters and mcus  into one single asic chip is the trend for chip technology development 
our expertise in this type of integrated design work allows us to offer our customers a shorter development cycle  smaller die size and faster turnaround time for final production  which strengthens our relationships with our customers and helps us to retain our competitive advantage in the important manufacturing region of asia pacific 
we outsource the manufacturing of these asics to a network of fabrication partners throughout asia pacific  including chartered semiconductor  samsung  toshiba semiconductor and tower semiconductor limited in israel 
our extensive network of fabrication partners allows us to remain competitive and minimizes our risk 
in addition to performing contract design work  we also design  produce and sell standard ics to oems of consumer electronics  game  telecommunication  internet appliance and personal computer equipment in asia pacific under the asp brand name 
chip product offerings include a universal serial bus usb controller  hub controller  memory controller  a single chip pda reduced instruction set computer risc processor  a single chip digital tuning system  an electronic shock protection controller for digital compact disk cd  a liquid crystal display lcd driver  a bit and bit dsp as well as   and bit micro controllers for applications in dvd players  set top box receivers  audio video equipment  telecommunication and game equipment  mp players  televisions and mini and micro stereo hi fi systems 
the products created are based upon management s analysis of trends in the market  knowledge gained from long standing relationships with customers and overall business experience 
many of these products are developed by capitalizing upon valence s extensive custom design libraries  advanced mixed signal design technologies  system level expertise  software knowledge and a deep understanding of customer requirements 
in addition  through valence we have started to develop analog audio processor ics based on srs audio and voice technologies targeting the mass volume consumer electronics products  such as boom boxes  televisions  lcd monitors and surround headphones 
these products are sold under the asp brand name 
low power analog ics incorporating srs trubass  srs wow and srs dialog clarity technologies were released to the market during the fourth quarter of fiscal our vast experience and knowledge in mixed signal design has enabled us to develop powerful and bit high speed dsps with low power consumption and high performance features using deep sub micron technology down to microns 
this dsp core technology will enable us to optimize srs audio solutions that are applicable to new digital product applications for telecommunications  audio video and internet appliances 
components and ip licensing during fiscal  we continued to decrease our emphasis on the low margin distribution businesses  as we had announced during fiscal by the fourth quarter of fiscal  our distribution relationships with philips semiconductor  tripath and molex hong kong had either terminated or had been reduced to selling off existing inventory  which will result in minimal revenue in fiscal while we will no longer be an official distributor for these semiconductor companies  we will continue to work with them or other third parties to deliver turkey technology solutions 
based on various system platforms  we will develop a reference system with our own asp chip and software or srs audio technologies 
some of the software will be embedded into the core cpu or chips of third parties and we will charge them a royalty if they sell the chips to their customers with our software and hardware platform 
under this arrangement  we charge for ip royalty but are not required to carry inventory  except in the case of our own branded asp chips 
backlog sales at valence are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for the delivery of asic  ic and component products 
order quantities and delivery schedules are frequently changed to reflect product availability  scheduling at our fabrication partner facilities or changes in our customers needs 
customer orders can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
accordingly  our backlog at any particular date is not representative of actual sales for any succeeding period  and we therefore believe that backlog is not generally a good indicator of future revenue 
as of december and  the backlog of orders for asic design work to non affiliated parties was  and  respectively 
as of december and  the backlog of orders for components was  and  respectively 
we expect that all or a substantial amount of the current backlog of orders for will be completed in fiscal backlog is applicable only to our valence operating unit 
research and development our customers compete in markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuous improvement in products and services 
our research and development expenditures in fiscal  and were approximately  and of total operating expenses respectively 
these expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees and consultants engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities and costs for engineering materials and supplies as of december   we had employees in our r d group representing of our total human resources 
our software  hardware and application engineers focus on developing intellectual property  technology solutions and consumer products 
ten engineers are based in the us with the remainder based in hong kong 
competition we compete in each of our business segments with a number of different companies which produce a variety of technologies  processes and products 
srs labs competition in the audio  voice and surround sound technology licensing business includes other licensing companies who offer competing technologies as well as the internal engineering department of our licensees  who may develop audio enhancement techniques for their own products 
in the field of d audio enhancement  we compete directly with other audio providers  including qsound  spatializer  aureal  bbe sound and sensaura 
we believe that our bass enhancement technology  trubass  competes directly with several technologies  including maxxbass from waves  ltd  vibe from spatializer  and non proprietary bass systems  such as bass boost  that are included on a variety of electronics products  including audio systems  televisions  boom boxes and speaker products 
because our audio enhancement techniques work with any existing recorded material whether mono  stereo or surround sound  most of our audio enhancement technologies  including srs d sound  srs focus  srs trubass  srs dialog clarity  can be used either as an alternative or as a complement and enhancement to almost any competing audio technology 
many companies in the wireless and telecommunications industry are investigating methods to increase the quality of a voice signal  but we believe that their development work centers on techniques to reduce noise and provide echo cancellation 
we are not aware of any direct competing technologies to our voice technology  vip  which processes the actual voice signal to improve intelligibility and works on the formants of the human speech pattern 
vip is compatible to these other noise cancellation techniques 
several technologies within our surround sound portfolio  including trusurround  trusurround xt  circle surround and circle surround ii  compete directly with a variety of technologies from spatializer  qsound  dolby laboratories and dts  inc these competing processes include dolby prologic and prologic ii  analog  surround sound systems that can encode surround content as well as decode up to channels of surround sound from mono or stereo  dolby digital ac and dolby digital ex  that encode a six channel digital sound track on a movie print and decode six channels of digital audio in a consumer electronics device  dolby virtual speaker  which processes the multichannels of dolby digital or dolby surround over just two channels  creating a virtual surround sound experience  dts  which uses cds to reproduce six channels of digital sound synchronized with a movie print and decodes the six channels of sound in a consumer electronics device  and n from spatializer  which processes the multichannels of surround sound over two speakers 
certain of these companies referenced above have  or may have  substantially greater resources than us to devote to further technologies and new product developments 
we believe that we will compete based primarily on the quality and performance of our proprietary technologies  brand name awareness  the ease and cost of implementing our technologies  the ability to meet oems needs to differentiate their products  and the strength of our licensee relationships 
however  there can be no assurance that based on these factors  we will continue to be competitive with existing or future products or technologies of our competitors 
srswowcast in the broadcast and professional audio markets  our circle surround technology competes directly with surround sound formats from dolby laboratories and dts  inc  which market professional products for the encoding and creation of multichannel content 
both of these companies have more established reputations  greater technical  sales  marketing and distribution capabilities and stronger brand presence in the movie cinema  television broadcast and music recording segments of professional audio 
these competitors also have established or may establish strategic relationships with potential customers of our circle surround technology that may affect our customer s decisions to purchase products or license technology from us 
valence the asian pacific semiconductor industry is dominated by several major suppliers  such as motorola  national semiconductor and texas instruments 
these established semiconductor companies usually do not offer custom design services to manufacturers and will only do so if the number of semiconductors required by such manufacturers is very large 
instead  they supply standard ic products to their customers 
these standard semiconductors may not be the most suitable components for the manufacturers as they may require additional semiconductor components to perform the designed functions required in their products 
in such cases  these semiconductors will be bulkier  heavier and more expensive compared to one custom designed  system on a chip asic 
we do occasionally compete with smaller design houses in japan  taiwan or korea  such as sunplus  but most of these houses are focused on standard semiconductor chip categories  such as random access memory  micro controller and other non proprietary functional processes 
we believe that our asic team is more flexible in its strategy of designing new products  as well as more responsive in the service provided to clients 
with seventeen years of experience in the asian pacific semiconductor market  valence s personnel has expertise in local business practices and a strong franchise of relationships with clients that we believe gives us a competitive advantage over newcomers to the industry or the large multi national firms 
the markets in which we sell our products are subject to extreme price competition 
accordingly  we expect to continue to experience declines in the selling prices of our products over the life cycle of each product 
in order to offset declines in the selling prices of its products  we must continue to reduce the costs of products through product design changes  manufacturing process changes  volume discounts and other savings negotiated with our manufacturing subcontractors 
since we do not operate our own manufacturing facilities with respect to asics  products or components  it may not be able to reduce its costs as rapidly as competitors who perform their own manufacturing 
our ability to design and introduce  in a timely manner  lower cost versions of existing products or higher gross margin new products  or to successfully manage our manufacturing subcontractor relationships could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins 
intellectual property rights and proprietary information we operate in industries where innovation  investment in new ideas and protection of intellectual property rights are important for success 
we rely on a variety of intellectual property protections for our products and services  including patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and contractual obligations 
we pursue a policy of enforcing such rights 
there can be no assurance  however  that our intellectual property rights will be adequate to ensure our competitive position  or that competitors will not be able to produce a non infringing competitive product or service 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us  or that if required to obtain any third party licenses as a result of an infringement dispute  we will be able to obtain such licenses 
although we believe that our patents and trademarks are important to each of our business segments  such patents and trademarks are especially important to the licensing business segments 
in order to protect the underlying technology concepts  we have filed and or obtained patents for all of our marketed technologies including technologies marketed under the trademarks srs  trusurround  trusurround xt  focus  circle surround  circle surround ii  wow  vip and trubass 
in addition  we have numerous issued patents and patents pending for speaker and other acoustic reproduction technologies 
we pursue a general practice of filing patent applications for our technologies in the united states and various foreign countries where our licensees manufacture  distribute or sell licensed products 
we continually update and add new applications to our patent portfolio to address changing worldwide market conditions and our new technological innovations 
the range of expiration dates for our patents extend between the years to we have multiple patents covering unique aspects and improvements for many of our technologies 
accordingly  the expiration of any single patent is not likely to significantly affect our intellectual property position or the ability to generate licensing revenue 
our strategy for protection of our trademarks identifying the various srs technology solutions is commensurate with our strategy for obtaining patent protection 
specifically  we routinely file us federal and foreign trademark applications for the various word names and logos used to market our technology solutions to licensees and the general public 
the duration of the us and foreign registered trademarks can typically be maintained indefinitely  provided proper maintenance fees are paid and trademarks are continually used or licensed by the company 
seasonality due to our dependence on the consumer electronics market  we experience seasonal fluctuation is sales and earnings 
in particular  we believe that there is seasonality relating to the christmas season in the fourth quarter  as well as the chinese new year in the asia pacific region in the first quarter  which is generally the weakest 
we are moving toward diversifying our key market segments in the consumer electronics industry in an effort to even out our seasonal fluctuation 
employees the company employed persons as of december   including in finance and administration  in r d  engineering and product development and in sales and marketing 
of the aggregate number of employees  are employed by valence and are located overseas 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are presently represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the ability to collect upon our accounts receivable based on specific customer circumstances  current economic trends  historical experience and the age of past due receivables 
unanticipated changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers may require additional provisions for doubtful accounts 
inventory obsolescence reserves our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on our regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
if actual market conditions or our customer s product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional provisions may be required 
valuation of intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses  market conditions  and other factors 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
for fiscal  an independent valuation of goodwill and other intangibles was performed 
to date  we have not recognized any impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with our adoption of sfas and sfas however  no assurances can be given that future evaluation of goodwill will not result in charges as a result of future impairment
