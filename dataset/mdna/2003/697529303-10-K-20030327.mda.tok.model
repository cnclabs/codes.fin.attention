item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
b financial information about industry segments the company conducts business in one industry segment  medical and cosmetic products and services 
c description of business i principal products the company researches  develops  manufactures  markets  sells and services lasers and other light based products used to perform procedures addressing patients medical and cosmetic concerns 
the company offers a comprehensive range of products based on proprietary technologies that focus on laser and other light based applications including but not limited to hair removal non invasive treatment of facial and leg veins and other benign vascular lesions  such as rosacea removal of benign pigmented lesions such as age and sun spots tattoo removal other skin treatments market surveys report that the great majority of men and women in the united states and many other parts of the world employ one or more techniques for temporary hair removal from various parts of the body  including waxing  depilatories  tweezing  shaving  and electrolysis 
benefits of palomar s laser and other light based hair removal processes  as compared to such hair removal techniques  include significantly longer term cosmetic improvement and  as compared to other light based hair removal devices  treatment of larger areas in each treatment session  procedures that are relatively painless and non invasive  reduced risk of scarring and cross contamination  and better efficacy rates 
estelux 
during  palomar received fda clearance to market and sell the palomar estelux pulsed light system 
the estelux system has the fastest coverage rate  a long pulsewidth and spectrumax filtering 
it combines the latest flashlamp technology with simple  streamlined engineering and is both effective and economical 
the system features a large spot size that makes the system effective when treating large areas such as legs and backs as well as a wide spectrum of wavelengths nm 
in addition  the estelux s effective fluence is increased by palomar s photon recycling process  which captures light scattered out of the skin during treatments and redirects it back into the treatment target 
the estelux can treat a patient s back or a pair of legs in approximately minutes  and a smaller area  such as the underarms  in even less time 
the system s simple operation opens its applications to a wider band of worldwide users 
in  palomar offered four handpieces for the estelux system luxy  luxg  luxr and luxrs 
these four handpieces emit pulses of intense light to treat unwanted hair  solar lentigo sunspots  rosacea  actinic bronzing  spider veins  birthmarks  telangiectasias and more 
the luxy handpiece  which is sold with the estelux  is used for hair removal for large body areas and for pigmented lesion treatments 
the luxg handpiece delivers the rejuvelux process photofacial treatments that remove pigmented and vascular lesions while improving skin tone and texture 
the luxr handpiece can be used for hair removal treatments for all skin types  from the fairest to the darkest  including deep tans 
the luxrs handpiece treats all skin types  but packs concentrated power into each pulse for permanency  to remove hair in fewer treatments 
with these complimentary handpieces  the estelux system is one of the most affordable and multifaceted systems in the market 
in addition  palomar is introducing new handpieces and the next generation estelux platform in slp during  palomar received fda clearance to market and sell the palomar slp diode laser system 
the slp is a high powered diode laser that delivers energy over a relatively long time period using a technology called super long pulse technology 
the slp system is the first diode laser using super long pulse technology and interchangeable handpieces to provide hair removal and vascular lesion treatments to virtually all skin types 
in addition  the palomar slp system is compact and easy to use 
furthermore  palomar intends to introduce a new handpiece in q yag during  palomar received fda clearance to market and sell the palomar q yag system for tattoo and pigmented lesion removal 
the palomar q yag is a state of the art  q switched  frequency doubled neodymium laser 
this laser system allows users to switch between a nm single wavelength beam and a nm mixed wavelength beam 
the combination of wavelengths allows users to treat a full spectrum of colors and inks  and the system s design lowers costs and allows broader use of the instrument 
the single nm wavelength is ideal for treating darker tattoo inks and dermal pigmented lesions  such as nevi of ota 
the mixed nm wavelength is better suited for brighter colors and epidermal pigmented lesions  such as solar lentigines 
in addition  the mixed wavelength permits brighter  more superficial and deeper and darker target areas to be treated simultaneously 
the palomar q yag incorporates the laser into the handpiece making it smaller and lighter than current systems  which is especially desirable for mobile and or small physician offices 
these attributes reduce the cost  increase the reliability of the system and eliminate costly optics and service problems that are common with other high power q switched lasers 
rd the company sells a q switched ruby laser for tattoo removal and treating pigmented lesions  the rd 
the rd has been on the market for ten years 
intense competition in the medical device industry and market saturation for this type of laser have reduced rd sales over the last five years 
in addition  there are less expensive products now available for this purpose 
palomar expects sales of this product to continue in at a low volume to foreign countries where the advantages of the rd for treatment of pigmented lesions is especially important 
the company expects to replace the rd with the q yag by the end of e during  palomar introduced its second generation ruby laser  the palomar e hair removal laser system  a product that was superior to hair removal lasers then available in a number of respects  including speed and efficacy 
the palomar e was cleared by the fda for permanent hair reduction 
in  the company began the process of phasing out the e product line  including fully reserving the inventory related to this product line 
to date  the company has discontinued selling the e but continues to service the product line 
epilaser 
during  using the company s core ruby laser technology  originally developed for tattoo removal and pigmented lesions  the company developed a long pulse ruby laser  the epilaser  that was specifically configured to allow the appropriate wavelength  energy level and pulse duration to be absorbed effectively by the hair follicle without being absorbed by the surrounding tissue 
that  combined with a patented cooling handpiece  allowed for safe and effective hair removal 
in march  palomar was the first company to receive fda clearance to sell and market a ruby laser the epilaser system in the us for hair removal 
the palomar epilaser was cleared by the fda for permanent hair reduction in march in  the company began the process of phasing out the epilaser product line  including fully reserving the inventory related to this product line 
to date  the company has discontinued selling the epilaser but continues to service the product line 
distribution and service 
palomar has changed its distribution method over the past few years to address changes in market conditions and composition of its product lines 
the company has continued and will continue to hire a number of direct sales representatives to support the company s current products as well as additional products to be introduced in the company further intends to tailor distribution methods to different geographic regions and may include a combination of exclusive and non exclusive distributors  independent representatives and a direct sales force 
palomar sells and services products through distributors internationally 
in the united states and in certain other countries  palomar provides service through its own service organization 
ii products under development the company is engaged in developing products for the dermatology and cosmetic market 
products under development include lasers and other light based products for the removal of unwanted hair  tattoos  pigmented lesions  leg vein and other vascular lesions  acne  fat  skin rejuvenation and wrinkles 
palomar performs its own research as well as with partners  including the general hospital corporation general 
product development is performed by scientists and engineers at the company s headquarters 
the company splits its efforts between new products for existing markets such as the removal of unwanted hair  vascular and pigmented lesions and tattoos  and new products for markets  such as acne treatment  fat reduction and wrinkle removal 
as of february   the company entered into a development and license agreement with gillette to complete development and commercialize a home use  light based hair removal device for women 
the device is protected by multiple patents within palomar s patent portfolio 
this consumer hair removal device is expected to be safe and effective for use on women s legs  underarms  bikini line and other areas where a woman might find it necessary to shave  apply hair removal creams  or undergo waxing  electrolysis  or laser or other light based professional treatments in a doctor s office  clinic  spa or salon 
preliminary clinical results have demonstrated that a consumer s periodic use of the device  once every few weeks  for example  can allow the consumer to achieve and maintain smooth  hair free skin 
these results indicate that use of the device is pain free and safe for all skin types 
iii production  sources and availability of materials palomar s manufacturing operations are currently located in burlington  massachusetts 
palomar maintains control of and manufactures most key subassemblies in house 
manufacturing consists of the assembly and testing of components purchased from outside suppliers and contract manufacturers 
each fully assembled system is subjected to a rigorous set of tests prior to shipment to the customer or distributor 
the company has obtained iso  and en registration 
the company depends and will depend upon a number of outside suppliers for components used in its manufacturing process 
most of palomar s components and raw materials are available from a number of qualified suppliers 
if the company s suppliers are unable to meet the company s requirements on a timely basis  the company s production could be interrupted until the company obtains an alternative source of supply 
to date  the company has experienced significant failures and delays in a critical raw material component required for the slp although the company has received assurances from the critical component vendor that these failures and delays will be rectified in the near future  there can be no assurance that this situation will improve or that these failures and delays will be rectified 
further failures and delays could result in a material adverse affect on the value of certain inventory on hand and or amounts reserved for warranty expense relating to the slp the company has not experienced any other delays in raw material for the company s products 
iv patents and licenses the company s success and ability to compete are dependent on its ability to develop and maintain proprietary technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
the company relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect its proprietary technology 
these legal protections afford only limited protection for its technology 
the company presently has numerous issued patents and pending applications in the united states and in foreign countries 
however  the company cannot be certain that patents will be granted based on these or any other applications 
the company seeks to limit disclosure of its intellectual property by requiring employees  consultants and any third party with access to the company s proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with the company 
due to rapid technological change  the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel  new product developments and enhancements to existing products are as important as the various legal protections of the company s technology to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult 
litigation may be necessary to enforce intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
any such resulting litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
any failure by the company to meaningfully protect the company s proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition 
management believes that none of the company s current products infringe upon valid claims of patents owned by third parties 
however  there have been claims and there can be no assurance that third parties will not make further claims of infringement with respect to our current or future products 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
a successful claim of intellectual property infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or develop or license technology with comparable functionality could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results

b critical accounting policies the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
royalty revenues are recognized upon receipt of cash payments 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company regularly evaluates the collectibility of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors  which may include dialogue with the customer to determine cause of non payment  the use of collection agencies  and or the use of litigation 
in the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to the company  the company records a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount that the company expects to recover given all information present 
inventory reserves 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology equipment  the company may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
the company s policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
the company regularly evaluates its ability to realize the value of its inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining management s estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of management s forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and the company s reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  the company s reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of its inventory to its net realizable value 
product warranties 
products sold are generally covered by a warranty for a period of one year 
the company accrues a warranty reserve at the time of revenue recognition for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent the company experiences increased or decreased warranty claim activity or increased or decreased costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty accrual will increase or decrease  respectively  resulting in decreased or increased gross profit

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk i derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments sfas no 
requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments 
financial instruments consist of cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and short term debt obligations 
the fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount as of december   due to their short term nature 
all of the company s investments are considered cash equivalent money market accounts and debt securities  which are considered available for sale investments and are carried at market value  with the difference between cost and market value  net of related tax effects  recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
ii primary market risk exposures the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio of cash equivalents and debt securities is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but the company believes this risk is immaterial because of the short term nature of these investments

risk factors our future revenue depends on our successfully developing and marketing new products 
light based technology is rapidly changing and improving 
in order to be successful  we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to develop in a timely and cost effective manner new products that meet changing market demands  enhance existing products  and achieve market acceptance for such products 
we have in the past experienced delays in developing and marketing new products and enhancing existing products 
furthermore  some of our new products under development are based on unproven technology and or technology with which the company has no previous experience 
in addition  the market for professional hair removal light based devices may already be saturated 
at present  broader market acceptance of light based hair removal is critical to our success and we intend to continue our goals of bringing light based hair removal devices to the mass consumer market 
we also intend to continue to diversify our product line by developing cosmetic light based products for uses other than hair and tattoo removal and treatment of pigmented and vascular lesions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement such strategy in a timely fashion or at all 
we face intense competition from companies with superior financial  marketing and other resources 
the light based hair removal industry is highly competitive and companies frequently introduce new products 
we compete in the development  manufacture  marketing  sales and servicing of light based hair removal devices with numerous other companies  some of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
some of our competitors are able to sell light based hair removal devices at prices significantly below the prices at which we sell our products 
our products also face competition from medical products and cosmetic procedures  such as electrolysis and waxing  among others 
we may not be able to differentiate our products from the products of our competitors  and customers may not consider our products to be superior to competing products or procedures  especially if competitive products and procedures are offered at lower prices 
our competitors may develop products or new technologies that make our products obsolete or less competitive 
we may need to secure additional financing 
although the company has generated a profit in recent quarters  the company has a history of losses 
we may have to secure additional financing to complete our research and development activities  commercialize our current and proposed light based products  and fund ongoing operations 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be obtained 
we may also determine  depending upon the opportunities available  to seek additional debt or equity financing to fund the costs of operations or expansion 
additionally  if we incur indebtedness to fund increased levels of accounts receivable  finance the acquisition of capital equipment  or if we issue debt securities in connection with any acquisition we will be subject to risks associated with incurring substantial additional indebtedness 
our quarterly operating results are and may continue to be volatile  and that may hurt the price of our common stock 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could decline 
we could be delisted from nasdaq 
for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  a company must maintain a minimum bid price of per share 
a company must also maintain a minimum requirement of net tangible assets of million or market capitalization of million or net income in latest fiscal year or of the last fiscal years of  we are currently in compliance with all of nasdaq s requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
however  there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance with nasdaq s criteria for continued listing or that we will remain listed on nasdaq 
the delisting of our common stock would likely reduce the liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise capital 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  it will likely be quoted on the pink sheets maintained by the national quotation bureau  inc or nasdaq s otc bulletin board 
these listings can make trading more difficult for stockholders 
we depend on a number of vendors for critical components in our current and future products 
we develop light based systems that incorporate third party components 
some of these items are custom made or otherwise not readily available on the market 
we purchase some of these components from small  specialized vendors that are not well capitalized 
a disruption in the delivery of these key components could have an adverse effect on our business 
we depend on an acceptable level of reliability for purchased components 
reliability below expectations for key components could have an adverse affect on inventory and inventory reserves 
our products are subject to numerous medical device regulations 
compliance is expensive and time consuming 
our new products may not be able to obtain the necessary clearances in order to sell them 
all of our current products are light based devices  which are subject to fda regulations for clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion 
before a new product or a new use of or claim for an existing product can be marketed in the united states  we must obtain clearance from the fda 
we have modified some of our products under letters to file 
the fda could retroactively decide that the modifications require k or pma clearance and may force us to cease marketing and or recall the modified products 
our products may also be subject to state regulations  which are  in many instances  in flux 
changes in state regulations may enhance or impede sales 
our products are subject to similar regulations in our major international markets 
complying with these regulations is necessary for our strategy of expanding the markets for sales of our products into these countries 
compliance with the regulatory clearance process in any country is expensive and time consuming  and we may not be able to obtain such clearances in a timely fashion or at all 
regulatory clearances may necessitate clinical testing  limitations on the number of sales and limitations on the type of end user  among other things 
in certain instances  these constraints can delay planned shipment schedules as design and engineering modifications are made in response to regulatory concerns and requests 
federal regulation allows our products to be sold to and used by licensed practitioners as determined on a state by state basis 
as a result  in some states non physicians may operate our product 
however  a state could disagree with our decision to sell to a particular type of end user or change regulations allowing sales to particular types of end users 
similar risks apply to our international markets 
the purchase and use of our products by nonphysicians may result in their misuse  which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation 
we are dependent on third party researchers 
we are substantially dependent upon third party researchers over whom we do not have absolute control to satisfactorily conduct and complete research on our behalf 
we are also substantially dependent upon third party researchers to grant us licensing terms  which may or may not be favorable for products and technology  which they may develop 
at present  our principal research partner is the wellman laboratories of photomedicine at massachusetts general hospital 
we provide research funding  light technology and optics know how in return for licensing rights with respect to specific medical applications and patents 
in return for certain exclusive license rights  the company is subject to due diligence obligations in order to maintain such exclusivity 
our success will be highly dependent upon the results of research with our partners and meeting due diligence obligations 
we cannot be sure that third party researchers will agree with the company s interpretation of the terms of our agreements  that we will meet our due diligence obligations  or that such research agreements will provide us with marketable products in the future or that any of the products developed under these agreements will be profitable for us 
our common stock could be further diluted as the result of outstanding  convertible securities  warrants and options 
in the past  we have issued and still have outstanding convertible securities in the form of warrants in order to raise money and for payment of certain consulting agreements 
we have and may continue to issue options and warrants as compensation for services and incentive compensation for our employees and directors 
we have a substantial number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the conversion and exercise of these securities 
such a conversion would dilute our stockholders  and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our proprietary technology has only limited protections 
our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  license and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and third parties with whom we work  including but not limited to consultants and vendors  to restrict access to  and distribution of  our proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
costly and time consuming lawsuits may be necessary to enforce and defend patents issued or licensed exclusively to us  to protect our trade secrets and or know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of others intellectual property rights 
such lawsuits may result in patents issued or licensed exclusively to us to be found invalid and unenforceable 
our competitors also may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology and which do not infringe our patents 
we could become subject to claims by third parties regarding intellectual property rights 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
the light based hair removal industry in particular is characterized by the large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
because our resources are limited and patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period of time  we can conduct only limited searches to determine whether our technology infringes any patents or patent applications 
any claims for patent infringement  regardless of merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  cause shipment delays  require us to develop non infringing technology or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the light based industry have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and often require the payment of ongoing royalties  which could have a negative impact on gross margins 
there can be no assurance that necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms  or that we could redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement  if necessary 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our charter documents and delaware law may discourage potential takeover attempts 
our second restated certificate of incorporation and our by laws contain provisions that could discourage takeover attempts or make more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock 
our by laws require a stockholder to provide to the secretary of the company advance notice of director nominations and business to be brought by such stockholder before any annual or special meeting of stockholders  as well as certain information regarding such nomination and or business  the stockholder and others known to support such proposal and any material interest they may have in the proposed business 
they also provide that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors 
these provisions could delay any stockholder actions that are favored by the holders of a majority of the outstanding stock of the company until the next stockholders meeting 
in addition  the board of directors is authorized to issue shares of common stock and preferred stock that  if issued  could dilute and adversely affect various rights of the holders of common stock and  in addition  could be used to discourage an unsolicited attempt to acquire control of the company 
the company is also subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits the company from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person becomes an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the application of section may limit the ability of stockholders to approve a transaction that they may deem to be in their best interests 
these provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation  by laws and the delaware general corporation law could deter certain takeovers or tender offers or could delay or prevent certain changes in control or management of the company  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price 
as with any new products  there is substantial risk that the marketplace may not accept or be receptive to the potential benefits of our products 
market acceptance of our current and proposed products will depend  in large part  upon our or any marketing partner s ability to demonstrate to the marketplace the advantages of our products over other types of products 
there can be no assurance that the marketplace will accept applications or uses for our current and proposed products or that any of our current or proposed products will be able to compete effectively 
we may not be able to successfully collect licensing royalties 
in  material portions of our revenues consisted of royalties from sub licensing patents licensed to us on an exclusive basis by general 
lumenis failed to make the royalty payment due october   for sales of their lightsheer diode laser system for the quarter ended september   and on february   we terminated our license agreement with lumenis see part i  item  legal proceedings 
although the company was profitable in without this royalty payment from lumenis  this reduction and any other loss or reduction in our royalty revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition  affect future liquidity and prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability 
we face risks associated with pending litigation and there can be no assurance that these royalty amounts from other third parties will not decrease or that we will be able to collect all licensing royalties owed by current licensees or increase royalties by sub licensing additional third parties 
we are involved in disputes with other third parties  including altus see part i  item  legal proceedings 
such disputes have resulted in litigation with such parties 
we have incurred  and likely will continue to incur  legal expenses in connection with such matters 
there can be no assurance that such litigation will result in favorable outcomes for us 
any adverse result in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to retain our key executives and research and development personnel 
as a small company with less than employees  our success depends on the services of key employees in executive and research and development positions 
the loss of the services of one or more of these employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we face a risk of financial exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury 
our products are and will continue to be designed and manufactured with numerous safety features  but it is possible that consumers could be adversely affected by use of one of our products 
furthermore  in the event that any of our products prove to be defectively designed and manufactured  we may be required to recall and redesign such products 
although we have not experienced any material losses due to product liability claims to date  there can be no assurance that we will not experience such losses in the future 
we maintain general liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate and maintain umbrella coverage in the aggregate amount of million  however  there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or that such coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred 
in the event we are found liable for damages in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage or if any claim or product recall results in significant adverse publicity against us  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  although our products have been and will continue to be designed to operate in a safe manner  and although we attempt to educate customers with respect to the proper use of our products  misuse of our products by personnel over whom we cannot exert control may result in the filing of product liability claims or significant adverse publicity against us 
we face risks of obsolete inventory as a result of rapid changes in technology 
we operate in an industry that is subject to rapid changes in technology and intense competition  which could make our light based systems obsolete 
if forecasted demand decreases  we could have excess inventories  which could obsolete certain product lines and result in a write off of some or all of our inventory 
we face risks associated with revenues 
there can be no certainty as to the severity or duration of the current economic downturn and its impact on our future revenues 
we face risks associated with product warranties 
we could incur substantial costs as a result of product failures for which the company is responsible under warranty obligations 
we face risks associated with liquidity and capital resources 
there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing to fund our operations or that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
there can be no assurance that our revenues will increase or that we will generate sufficient revenues to achieve or sustain profitability 
while we strive to minimize the company s business expenses  we will continue to have large fixed expenses and we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  product development  customer support and service  administrative  legal and other expenses 
as a result  we need to generate a significant amount of revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
we face risks associated with selling more than half of our products and services internationally 
we sell more than half of our products and services outside of the united states and canada and expect that they will continue to be significant 
as a result  a major part of our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected by risks associated with international sales 
in particular  longer payment cycles common in foreign markets  credit risk and delays in obtaining necessary import or foreign regulating approvals for products may occur 
we face risks associated with managing a joint development and license agreement 
as of february   we entered into a development and license agreement with gillette to complete development and commercialize a home use  light based hair removal device for women 
we believe that this represents a significant opportunity to bring light based devices to the mass market 
however  under the agreement  significant resources and the attention of key technical personnel and management will be directed to the development of such a device even though such device will not likely be commercialized for several years  if ever 
in addition  we cannot be sure that gillette will agree with our interpretation of the terms of the agreement  that the agreement will provide us with marketable products in the future or that we will receive payments for any of the products developed under the agreement 
after the expiration of months and at several points thereafter  gillette has the ability to choose not to continue and may terminate the agreement 
in such cases  we will not receive certain payments but may proceed to develop and commercialize the device on our own or with a third party 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement such a strategy 
in addition  after commercialization of such device  gillette is to pay us a percentage of net sales of such device 
certain of these percentages of net sales are only owed if the device is covered by valid patents 
there can be no assurance that valid patents will cover the device in any or all countries in which the device will be manufactured  used or sold 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face risks associated with section a of the securities act of prior to june   arthur andersen llp served as the company s independent auditors 
on march   arthur andersen was indicted on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the government s investigation of enron corporation and on june   arthur andersen was found guilty 
arthur andersen informed the sec that it would cease practicing before the sec by august   unless the sec determined that another date was appropriate 
on june   the company dismissed arthur andersen and retained ernst young llp as its independent auditors for its current fiscal year ended december  sec rules require the company to present historical audited financial statements in various sec filings  such as registration statements  along with arthur andersen s consent to the company s inclusion of arthur andersen s audit report in those filings 
since the company s former engagement partner and audit manager have left arthur andersen and in light of the announced cessation of arthur andersen s sec practice  the company will not be able to obtain the consent of arthur andersen to the inclusion of arthur andersen s audit report in the company s relevant current and future filings 
the sec recently has provided regulatory relief designed to allow companies that file reports with the sec to dispense with the requirement to file a consent of arthur andersen in certain circumstances  but purchasers of securities sold under the company s registration statements  which were not filed with the consent of arthur andersen to the inclusion of arthur andersen s audit report will not be able to sue arthur andersen pursuant to section a of the securities act of and therefore the purchasers right of recovery under that section may be limited as a result of the lack of the company s ability to obtain arthur andersen s consent 
terrorist acts and acts of war may seriously harm our business and revenues  costs and expenses and financial condition 
terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to the company  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  distributors  resellers  or customers  which could significantly impact our revenues  costs and expenses and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially harm our business and results of operations 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted
