certain statements contained herein may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  as discussed more fully herein 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed herein are the following the failure of our markets to continue growing and expanding in the manner we anticipated  the failure of our customers to grow and expand as we anticipated  the effects of natural or other events beyond our control  including the effect a war or terrorist activities may have on the company or the economy  the economic environment s effect on us and our customers  the growth of  acceptance of and the demand for our products and technologies in various markets and geographical regions  including cable  satellite  consumer electronics  retail and interactive tv and home automation  not materializing as we believed  our inability to add profitable complementary products which are accepted by the marketplace  our inability to continue to maintain our operating costs at acceptable levels through our cost containment efforts  our realization of tax benefits from various tax projects initiated from time to time  the continued strength of our balance sheet  our inability to continue selling our products or licensing our technologies at higher or profitable margins throughout and beyond  the failure of the various markets and industries to grow or emerge as rapidly or as successfully as we believed  the continued growth of the digital market  our inability to obtain orders or maintain our order volume with new and existing customers  the possible dilutive effect our stock option program may have on our earnings per share and stock price  our inability to continue to obtain adequate quantities of component parts or secure adequate factory production capacity on a timely basis  and other factors listed from time to time in our press releases and filings with the securities and exchange commission

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  inventories  valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on the sale of products when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is pervasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for the majority of our sales  recognition occurs when products are shipped 
we also license our patented technologies and database of infrared codes 
we record license revenue when our customers ship products incorporating our technologies and database  provided collection of such revenue is reasonably assured 
in addition  we generate service revenues as a result of providing consumer support programs  through our call center  to various universal remote control marketers 
these service revenues are recognized when earned 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly estimate returns and sales allowances  revenue could be overstated 
accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivables and historical bad debts  customer credit  current economic trends and changes in customer payment trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
inventories consist of wireless control devices  including universal remote controls  wireless keyboards  antennas  and related component parts and are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets and other intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  and based on the carrying value of the asset being less than the undiscounted cash flows  we measure an impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in assessing the recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
 which we adopted on january   establishing standards for performing certain tests of impairment on long lived assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortization on approximately million of net unamortized goodwill beginning january  we recorded approximately  of amortization during and would have recorded approximately  of amortization during we performed an initial impairment review of our goodwill on january   conducted an annual impairment review as of december  and will perform an annual review in subsequent years 
in performing the initial impairment review  we identified our reporting units and determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill  to those reporting units as of january  we then determined the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of expected future cash flows and compared it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
based on this analysis  we 
table of contents determined that each reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying amount  and therefore concluded that there was no indication of a transitional impairment loss 
as further mandated by sfas no 
 we performed an annual impairment test of our goodwill as of december  using the same methodology employed for the initial impairment review of our goodwill  and determined that there was no indication of an impairment loss 
income taxes 
income tax expense includes us and international income taxes 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated income statements 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assess the need for valuation allowances quarterly 
in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made

selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in  compared to million in primarily due to an ongoing effort to contain and minimize our costs 
this decrease was attributable to reduced delivery and freight expenses  reduced professional fees and an overall decrease in payroll  commission and bonus related costs  partially offset by increased advertising costs and bad debt expenses 
delivery and freight expenses decreased million  from million in to million in  as a result of lower sales volumes along with increased use of less expensive delivery methods and aggressive negotiations with our freight vendors  which have resulted in increased shipping and operating efficiencies

table of contents of america national trust and savings association b of a 
under the agreement with b of a which is set to expire on april   we can choose from several interest rate options at our discretion 
the interest rate in effect as of december  using the ibor rate option plus a fixed margin of  was 
we pay a commitment fee at a maximum rate of of per year on the unused portion of the credit line 
under the terms of this agreement  our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is restricted and we are subject to certain financial covenants and other restrictions that are standard for these types of agreements 
however  we have authority under this credit facility to acquire up to  shares of our common stock in market purchases 
we purchased  shares at a cost of  since the date of this agreement through december  amounts available for borrowing under this credit facility are reduced by the outstanding balance of our import letters of credit 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
in addition to the  shares of our common stock purchased during at a cost of  we purchased  shares of common stock in on the open market at a cost of  there were no open market purchases of our common stock in we hold shares purchased on the open market as treasury stock  and they are available for reissue

annual capital expenditures relate primarily to acquiring product tooling each year 
during the second quarter of  we completed an acquisition of certain multimedia protocol technologies from a software development company for  these technologies enable custom wireless control solutions for home entertainment hardware and software applications 
on august   we completed our acquisition of a remote control distributor in france for approximately million  of which million was paid during   was paid during and the remaining amount was paid during historically  our working capital needs have typically been greatest during the third and fourth quarters when accounts receivable and inventories increase in connection with the fourth quarter holiday selling season 
at december   we had million of working capital compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in working capital during is principally due to increases in cash and short term investments at december  the following summarizes our obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
other obligations primarily consist of payments to one of our former directors for services rendered
