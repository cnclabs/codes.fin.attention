item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenues from mobile devices and accessories products increased significantly  network infrastructure sales decreased  and revenues from installation  test and maintenance products remained flat 
network infrastructure  mobile devices and accessories and installation  test and maintenance products and services accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of fiscal revenue  as compared to  and  respectively  of fiscal revenues 
revenue increases in the consumer and dealers and resellers categories were offset by decreases in the systems operators and international categories 
the largest increase was experienced in the consumer category  while the largest decrease was in the international category 
systems operators  dealers and resellers  consumers  and international users accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of fiscal revenues  as compared to   and  respectively  of fiscal revenues 
we believe that revenues from all categories were negatively affected by the disaster that occurred in our global logistics center on october  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the recovery efforts delayed the launch of and affected numerous commercial proactive marketing and sales initiatives 
we came to a partial and interim settlement with our insurance carrier on our third quarter business interruption claim in the amount of million 
this amount has been recorded as a benefit from insurance proceeds in the consolidated income statements 
because the remainder of our third quarter business interruption claim has not been settled  and since the timing and amount of proceeds from any other future claims for business interruption insurance are uncertain  we are not able to estimate or accrue additional amounts at this time 
we have recorded a million insurance receivable on our balance sheet associated with this disaster 
the components of the receivable are million of disaster related expenses  plus million representing the book value of assets destroyed in the disaster  plus the million interim and partial settlement discussed above  less insurance advances from our insurance carrier of million as of march  subsequent to the balance sheet date  disaster recovery expenses continue to be incurred and paid by us  we have received payment of the partial business interruption claim noted above  and have settled and received payment on our building and information technology claims 
we believe that insurance proceeds less minimal deductibles will be adequate to cover financial loss 
the significant increase in revenues from mobile devices and accessories is attributed to increased volumes from our ongoing t mobile usa affinity relationship  partially offset by the affect of the disaster on our commercial business 
this relationship is an e commerce  complete supply chain relationship 
we sell and deliver wireless telephones and accessories to consumers and other end users 
we purchase the telephones and accessories  record orders via internet ordering tools and hotlines  and then serialize  package and kit the telephones and accessories for delivery to the end user 
the decline in revenues of network infrastructure products can be attributed in part to the tight capital markets as well as to the disaster 
many of our customers are experiencing difficulty in obtaining consistent and continuing access to capital  thus resulting in decreased capital expenditures and delayed deployment of new technologies and  correspondingly  reduced purchases of our products 
revenue for installation  test and maintenance products was essentially flat from fiscal to fiscal we supply repair and replacement materials to authorized service centers for nokia inc nokia in the united states 
sales of the nokia repair and replacement materials accounted for approximately of our total revenues in fiscal although sales of these products in fiscal increased over fiscal  this increase was offset by a decrease in sales of high value test equipment  which can also be attributed to the disaster and the difficulties described in the above paragraph 
our on going ability to earn revenues from customers and vendors looking to us for product and supply chain solutions  including t mobile usa and nokia  is dependent upon a number of factors 
the terms  and accordingly the factors  applicable to each affinity relationship often differ 
among these factors are the strength of the customer s or vendor s business  the supply and demand for the product or service  and our ability to support the customer or vendor and to continually demonstrate that we can improve the way they do business 
we believe that in order to achieve our stated goal of increasing market share through these and our other vendor and customer relationships  we must focus on achieving a higher share of current product categories purchased by our customers  both large and small  expanding the product categories purchased by these customers  and continuing to acquire and sell more customers  on a monthly basis 
in addition  the agreements or arrangements on which these affinity relationships are based are typically of limited duration  and are terminable by either party upon several months notice 
we are conscious of this possibility and are dedicated to superior performance and quality and consistency of service in an effort to maintain and expand these relationships 
thus far  we believe that we have been successful in these efforts 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in gross profit is due to the increase in revenues 
the gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit margin percent for mobile devices and accessories decreased significantly on significantly increased volume  gross profit margin percent for installation  test and maintenance products decreased slightly  while gross profit margin percent for network infrastructure products increased slightly 
the decrease in mobile devices and accessories gross profit margin was attributable to growth in lower margin handset sales related to the expansion of the existing mobile devices and accessories relationship discussed above 
we account for inventory at the lower of cost or market  and as a result  write offs write downs occur due to damage  deterioration  obsolescence  changes in prices and other causes 
total selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal total selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal  from in fiscal this increase in total selling  general and administrative expenses was incurred in an effort to drive future growth  as well as in support of the large increase in consumer sales 
we continue to increase our investment in operations and technology personnel 
as of march   we employed people compared to as of march  because of the continued success of our affinity relationships  the number of orders we delivered in fiscal grew significantly compared to fiscal these consumer orders are typically smaller in size and weight and many items are delivered to residences  not typical places of business 
the resulting freight charges we pay to third party common carriers with whom we contract for those deliveries is greater  as a percentage of revenue  than larger commercial shipments 
our information technology support costs  including depreciation  increased this fiscal year as we continue to develop  build  maintain and host private labeled web sites for our affinity partners  as well as continuing to develop tessco 
com and other internal systems 
effective april   in accordance with fas  we no longer amortize goodwill see note 
goodwill expense of  was included in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal we continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve  based on this evaluation 
we also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such prospects based on this evaluation 
accordingly  we recorded a provision for bad debts of  and  for the years ended march  and march   respectively 
as a result of the factors described above  and partially offset by the receipt of a million benefit from insurance proceeds  income from operations decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the operating income margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal net interest and other expense decreased by  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease is due to decreased levels of borrowing under our revolving credit facility and lower interest rates 
income before the provision for income taxes decreased million or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a result of the factors described above 
the effective tax rates in fiscal and were and  respectively 
net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal decreased and  respectively  compared to fiscal results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the overall decrease was primarily due to a decrease in network infrastructure sales as a result of the difficulty experienced by wireless carriers and supporting companies in financing their infrastructure needs and growth plans 
revenues from network infrastructure and mobile devices and accessories decreased  while revenues from installation  test and maintenance products increased 
network infrastructure  mobile devices and accessories and installation  test and maintenance products and services accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of fiscal revenue  as compared to  and  respectively  of fiscal revenues 
revenue increases in the dealers and resellers and international user categories were offset by decreases in systems operators and consumer categories 
the largest increase was experienced in the dealers and resellers category  while the largest decrease was in the systems operator category 
systems operators  dealers and resellers  consumers and international users accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of fiscal revenues  as compared to   and  respectively  of fiscal revenues 
gross profit decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in gross profit is due to the decrease in revenues 
the gross profit margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a significant increase in sales for installation  test and maintenance products combined with a decrease in sales of network infrastructure products 
we account for inventory at the lower of cost or market  and as a result  write offs write downs occur due to damage  deterioration  obsolescence  changes in prices and other causes 
total selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal total selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal  from in fiscal this relatively nominal overall increase occurred notwithstanding substantial increases in some specific items or categories of selling  general and administrative expenses associated with and incurred in an effort to drive future growth 
these include investments in sales and marketing personnel  facility improvements and expansion and depreciation and amortization charges relative to information system enhancements 
the increases in these items or categories of expenses were  however  largely offset by significant decreases in fulfillment costs and corporate support categories  including shipping charges  off site storage facility costs  bad debt expenses and recruiting and professional services expenses 
we continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve  based on this evaluation 
we also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such prospects based on this evaluation 
accordingly  we recorded a provision for bad debts of  and  for the years ended march  and april   respectively 
as a result of the factors described above  income from operations decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the operating income margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal net interest and other expense decreased by  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease is due to decreased levels of borrowing under our revolving credit facility and lower interest rates 
income before the provision for income taxes decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a result of the factors described above 
the effective tax rates in fiscal and were and  respectively 
net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal decreased and  respectively  compared to fiscal our fiscal financial performance  as measured by revenue and earnings per share growth  was strong for the first nine months  but weakened during the fourth quarter of fiscal this trend continued during the first quarter of fiscal  when revenues declined compared to the prior year s first quarter and earnings per share was 
during the second and third quarters of fiscal  we experienced sequential growth in revenues and earnings per share 
earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal were essentially flat compared to the third quarter 
this occurred even though revenue declined sequentially  because our gross margin percentage increased and operating expenses decreased in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of fiscal capital markets continued to be tight in fiscal  and therefore  a number of our customers  particularly those involved in building out new or expanding or improving existing cellular or broadband systems  were then experiencing difficulty in obtaining consistent and continuing access to capital to finance their growth  and correspondingly  to finance the purchase of our products 
this difficulty affected primarily our infrastructure product category 
notwithstanding this difficulty  we experienced only a modest decline in revenues for the fiscal year 
this occurred in part because of strong demand for mobile devices and accessories and replacement parts and because of strong sales of installation  test and maintenance products  as wireless infrastructures continue to age 
our modest revenue decline in this difficult environment demonstrated  we believe  several important items the strength of our business model  the advantage of our diverse product and solutions offering  that we have made progress toward our ongoing goal of increasing market share  and that we are well positioned in a difficult market 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased to million as of march   from million as of march  shareholders equity increased to million as of march   from million as of march  we generated million of net cash from operating activities in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  our cash flow from operations was driven largely by net income plus depreciation and amortization  and a significant decrease in product inventory  partially offset by smaller increases in trade accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the significant decrease in product inventory was due to an improvement in inventory turnover  driven mostly by a change in sales mix 
typically  sales of mobile devices and accessory inventory occur on a higher number of smaller dollar valued orders as compared to the other  more expensive products we sell 
the nature and frequency of the mobile devices and accessory orders is therefore more predictable generally than those of other higher priced products and thus requires less inventory investment to support the expected sales volumes 
also  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we made a large strategic purchase of network infrastructure inventory 
during fiscal  we sold through much of this inventory 
in fiscal  our cash flow from operations was driven mostly by net income plus depreciation and amortization  and by a large increase in trade accounts payable  partially offset by smaller increases in trade accounts receivable and product inventory 
capital expenditures totaled million in fiscal  primarily related to improvements made to the alc and investments in information technology 
in fiscal  capital expenditures totaled million  comprised primarily of investments in information technology and the purchase of the alc 
we used million of net cash from financing activities in fiscal compared to a net usage of million in fiscal in fiscal  our revolving line of credit balance decreased from million at march   to at march  we took no draws on this line of credit in the third or fourth quarter 
our revolving credit facility with a bank provides for a maximum borrowing capacity of million and has a term expiring in september this agreement contains certain conditions  covenants and representations  all of which were complied with as of march  we are currently negotiating for a revolving credit facility for a term beyond september  and expect that we will be able to establish that facility in a timely manner and on reasonable terms 
to minimize interest expense  our policy generally is to use excess available cash to pay down the balance  if any  on our revolving credit facility 
effective april   our board of directors approved a share buyback program  authorizing the purchase of up to  shares of our outstanding common stock as well as a stock option repurchase program see note 
we expect to fund these undertakings from working capital and or our revolving credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue when product is shipped to the customer 
our current and potential customers are continuing to look for ways to reduce their inventories and lower their total costs  including distribution  order taking and fulfillment costs  while still providing their customers excellent service 
some of these companies have turned to us to implement supply chain solutions  including purchasing inventory  assisting in demand forecasting  configuring  packaging  kitting and delivering products and managing customer relations  from order taking through cash collections 
in performing these solutions  we assume varying levels of involvement in the transactions and varying levels of credit and inventory risk 
as our solutions offerings continually evolve to meet the needs of our customers  we constantly evaluate our revenue accounting based on the guidance set forth in accounting standards generally accepted in the united states 
when applying this guidance  we look at the following indicators whether we are the primary obligor in the transaction  whether we have general inventory risk  whether we have latitude in establishing price  the extent to which we change the product or perform part of the service  whether we have supplier selection  whether we are involved in the determination of product and service specifications  whether we have physical inventory risk  whether we have credit risk  and whether the amount we earn is fixed 
each of our customer relationships is independently evaluated based on the above guidance and revenue is recorded on the appropriate basis 
valuation of goodwill 
our consolidated balance sheet includes goodwill of approximately million 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows  market conditions  operational performance and legal factors 
based on our valuations of goodwill completed during the fiscal year  we determined that goodwill was not impaired 
future events  such as significant changes in cash flow assumptions  could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the net book value of goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets is impaired 
had the determination been made that the goodwill asset was impaired  the value of this asset would have been reduced by an amount up to million  resulting in a charge to operations 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability 
this review is based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
based on this review  we have not established a valuation allowance 
if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets  resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables reflect a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of march  payment due by fiscal year total and thereafter long term debt revolving credit facility operating leases other commitments total contractual cash obligations recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for certain costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
statement no 
requires that these costs be recorded at their fair value when a liability has been incurred 
under previous guidance  certain exit costs were accrued upon management s commitment to an exit plan  which is generally before an actual liability has been incurred 
the provisions of statement no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  adoption of this standard had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others 
the interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of interpretation no 
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements in interpretation no 
are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  adoption of this standard had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements this report contains a number of forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  all of which are based on current expectations 
these forward looking statements may generally be identified by the use of the words may  will  believes  should  expects  anticipates  estimates  and similar expressions 
our future results of operations and other forward looking statements contained in this report involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
for a variety of reasons  actual results may differ materially from those described in any such forward looking statement 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the following our dependence on a relatively small number of suppliers and vendors  which could hamper our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and meet customer demand  the effect that the loss of certain customers or vendors could have on our net profits  economic conditions that may impact customers ability to fund purchases of our products and services  the possibility that unforeseen events could impair our ability to service customers promptly and efficiently  if at all  the possibility that  for unforeseen reasons  we may be delayed in entering into or performing  or may fail to enter into or perform  anticipated contracts or may otherwise be delayed in realizing or fail to realize anticipated revenues or anticipated savings  existing competition from national and regional distributors and the absence of significant barriers to entry which could result in pricing and other pressures on profitability and market share  and continuing changes in the wireless communications industry  including risks associated with conflicting technologies  changes in technologies  inventory obsolescence and evolving internet business models and the resulting competition 
consequently  the reader is cautioned to consider all forward looking statements in light of the risks to which they are subject 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments 
management believes that exposure to market risks  including foreign currency exchange rate risk  interest rate risk and commodity price risk  is not material at the present time
