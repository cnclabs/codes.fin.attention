item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal sales decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal of the total decline  million was due to the closure of restaurants since august   that were not included in the new business plan  and million was due to a decrease in same store sales 
these decreases were offset by the positive impact of two additional days of sales of million and the opening of three restaurants since august   that accounted for million in sales 
the cost of food increased million  or  and as a percentage of sales increased from to in fiscal compared to fiscal early in the fiscal year  the increase in food cost was related primarily to efforts to implement value offerings for the company s guests 
those offerings were a planned part of the company s strategy aimed at increasing value while maintaining quality 
also in the beginning of the year  fresh produce pricing was negatively impacted by increased transportation costs due to the higher cost of diesel fuel 
toward the end of the year  upward pressure on beef pricing due to lower availability  reduced cattle weights  and an overall higher demand negatively impacted food cost 
these increases completely offset reductions due to store closures 
even so  the increases were partially mitigated in the later part of the year by targeted cost control programs 
payroll and related costs decreased million  or  and as a percentage of sales decreased from to 
the decrease was due primarily to the company s continued operational focus on labor efficiencies coupled with lower workers compensation expense in fiscal of the total reduction  million was due to improved labor deployments and efficiencies resulting from various company initiatives to reduce labor costs 
an additional million of the total decline was due to lower workers compensation costs resulting from the company s in house training and safety programs 
the remainder related to stores closed prior to the adoption of the new business plan 
occupancy and other operating expenses decreased million  or 
several factors contributed to this fluctuation 
net repairs and maintenance costs decreased primarily due to increased efficiencies from the company s in house repair program as provided by its in house service center 
food to go packaging costs further declined due to less expensive packaging 
these decreases were partially offset by property employee insurance  which increased principally due to premium increases for owned properties coupled with pass through insurance adjustments from landlords of leased properties  as well as premium increases for directors and officers liability 
depreciation and amortization expense was approximately equal to the prior fiscal year  with a slight decrease of  general and administrative expenses increased million  or 
several factors contributed to this increase 
professional fees increased principally due to a fixed asset  cost segregation study on tax depreciation 
consulting costs increased principally due to fees paid to outside firms relating to the company s bank group 
excluding those items  the company showed higher year over year general and administrative expenses because of the increased investment in support personnel to improve its focus on operational efficiencies and facilities maintenance 
the provision for asset impairments and restaurant closings charged to continuing operations increased by million due to impairments on various locations that were either not yet closed per the new business plan or were a part of prior impairment and disposal plans 
interest expense was approximately equal to the prior fiscal year  with only a slight decrease of  the payoff of loans on officers life insurance policies  which were surrendered during the prior year  in addition to amortization of the loss on interest rate swaps and principal reductions on the outstanding bank debt  contributed to this decrease 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the effective interest rate on outstanding debt coupled with an increase in the amortization of the discount on the subordinated notes 
approximately million and million were reclassified from interest expense to discontinued operations in fiscal and  respectively 
these reclassifications related to the launch of the company s new business plan whereby the proceeds from certain properties closed and sold are committed to paying down debt 
other income increased million primarily due to gains on the sales of assets  which reflect the sale of nine previously closed stores 
these gains were partially offset by a loan commitment fee expensed in fiscal the income tax benefit decreased by million 
no benefit was recorded in fiscal because the realization of loss carryforward utilization is uncertain 
the loss from discontinued operations increased by million principally due to approximately million in noncash impairments  with the remainder in carrying costs  allocated bank debt interest  and certain settlement fees incurred on various locations closed as part of the company s new business plan 
the impairment charges included reductions in the fourth quarter of from gains on the disposal of properties previously held for sale 
also see the discussion below entitled debt the new business plan 
relative to prior closure plans  the company had a reserve for restaurant closings of approximately million and million at august   and august   respectively 
excluding certain lease termination settlements  all material cash outlays required for the store closings originally planned as of august   were made prior to august  see further discussion in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal of the total decline  million was due to an decrease in same store sales  while million was due to the closure of restaurants since august   in addition  there were three fewer days during fiscal  accounting for approximately million of the total sales decline 
the decreases were partially offset by the opening of one new restaurant  which accounted for  in additional sales 
cost of food decreased million  or  due primarily to fewer restaurants and the decline in same store sales 
food cost as a percentage of sales increased from to in fiscal in comparison with fiscal various manager s special promotions coupled with new all you can eat offerings at selected locations contributed to higher food costs as a percent of sales 
payroll and related costs decreased million  or  due primarily to restaurant closures unrelated to the new business plan  lower workers compensation expense  and three fewer days in fiscal of the total reduction  million was due to lower wages and associated payroll taxes resulting from numerous store closures and million was due to lower workers compensation costs 
relative to the latter  in fiscal  there was a large increase for estimated claims expense under the company s historical third party program 
the company initiated a safety training and accident prevention program in october that substantially lowered fiscal costs 
occupancy and other operating expenses decreased million  or 
although the dollar decrease was primarily due to store closures  other factors contributed to the fluctuation 
utility expenses decreased due to lower energy commodity costs coupled with moderate temperatures and conservation 
advertising costs declined due to a reduced emphasis on television media spending 
food to go packaging costs further declined due to the intentional redirection at many locations to inside dining coupled with less expensive packaging 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased  or  due to fewer depreciable properties resulting from previous impairments and property sales 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or 
several factors contributed to the decline 
officers compensation decreased principally due to a reduction in relative headcount coupled with accelerated vesting of noncash option compensation in fiscal charges related to the proxy and restructuring advice contributed to higher professional costs in fiscal consulting fees were less principally due to a preliminary search for new senior management in fiscal the provision for asset impairments and restaurant closings decreased by million due to numerous impairments and provisions for impairments recorded in the prior year 
charges of  were recorded in fiscal principally to account for labor termination costs and an additional store closing  net of unrelated lease settlements that were more favorable than anticipated 
interest expense decreased  or  due primarily to lower effective interest rates on outstanding bank debt  the payoff of the loans on surrendered officers life insurance policies  and principal reductions in the outstanding bank debt 
these factors were offset by interest on the million in subordinated debt  amortization of the loss on interest rate swaps  and the amortization of amendment fees for the credit facility 
approximately million and million were reclassified from interest expense to discontinued operations in fiscal and  respectively 
this was done for comparability to fiscal  which includes the launch of the company s new business plan whereby the proceeds of properties closed and sold are being used to pay down debt 
the income tax benefit decreased by million  or  primarily due to a significantly lower incurred loss in fiscal versus fiscal the loss from discontinued operations increased by  or 
this was due primarily to increased operating losses on properties later associated with the company s new business plan 
ebitda the company s operating performance is evaluated using several measures 
one of those measures  ebitda  is derived from the income loss from operations gaap measurement 
ebitda has historically been used by the company s credit facility lenders to measure compliance with certain financial debt covenants 
the company s credit facility debt agreement defines ebitda as the sum of operating income  plus nonrecurring  noncash charges which decrease operating income  plus depreciation and amortization  minus nonrecurring credits which are included in operating income 
the agreement further specifies that ebitda shall exclude the noncash portion of the ceo s and the coo s stock option compensation  cost of stock options with employees  accounting requirements for future store closings required by gaap  and costs of closing a store location 
ebitda decreased by million from fiscal to compared to an increase of million from fiscal to these net changes were due to various applicable reasons noted in the results of operations section above 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
year ended august  august  august  days days days in thousands income loss from operations less excluded items provision for asset impairments and restaurant closings depreciation and amortization noncash executive compensation expense ebitda while the company and many in the financial community consider ebitda to be an important measure of operating performance  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  such as operating income and net income 
in addition  the company s definition of ebitda is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
liquidity and capital resources cash and working capital cash decreased by  from the end of the preceding fiscal year to august   primarily due to capital purchases and certain initial store closure costs  which were offset by reductions in short term investments and a large tax refund 
the million income tax receivable balance as of the prior fiscal year end related to tax benefits 
the company received a comprehensive refund of million in the third quarter of fiscal that resulted from changes in tax legislation that extended carrybacks of net operating losses 
the refund was higher than the original fiscal estimate primarily due to increases in tax depreciation relative to an updated cost segregation study 
after taking into account the current classification of its senior and subordinated debt  the company had a working capital deficit of million as of august   compared to million as of august  the improvement was primarily attributable to paydowns on the company s senior credit facility 
excluding the reclassification of the credit facility balance and subordinated notes explained in the debt section below  the company s working capital deficit increased million 
that increase in the deficit was primarily attributable to continued requirements to internally fund cash needs  including capital acquisitions 
the increase was partially offset by the collection of the income tax receivable explained above 
as of august   the company owned properties held for sale  including three undeveloped land sites 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended august   were million 
consistent with prior fiscal years  the company used most of its capital funds to maintain its investment in existing operating units 
based on the business plan for fiscal  the company again intends to fund all capital expenditures from cash flows from operations and expects them to be no more than million for that fiscal year 
debt new business plan during the mid s  the company entered into a revolving line of credit with a bank group 
it was primarily used for financing long term objectives  including capital acquisitions and a stock repurchase program 
capacity under that credit facility was fully exhausted in fiscal  at which time the company was unable to draw further advances under the agreement 
since then  existing management has financed its capital acquisitions and working capital needs through careful cash management and the provision of an additional million in financing in fiscal from the company s ceo and the coo 
current management recognized the need to arrange financing that would better match long term assets with the existing debt 
accordingly  early in the second quarter of fiscal  the company executed a commitment letter with a third party lender for an million loan to replace that amount of debt in the existing credit facility 
simultaneously  when the current bank group provided a waiver and amendment  it also added a stipulation that required the new million financing be completed and funded by january  however  the company was unable to finalize the new financing arrangement because of changes in the proposed agreement terms that the company believed were not in its best interest 
this led to a default under the credit facility that the company is currently focused on rectifying 
even though the lack of replacement financing caused a default  the company was in compliance with its financial performance covenants at the end of the second quarter and no default in interest payments has occurred as of the date this sec report was filed 
also as of that date  the existing bank group has taken no legal action related to the default other than to notify the company that it reserves all of its rights and remedies 
management has actively communicated with the credit facility bank group  while working on its new business plan that is focused on returning the company to profitability 
the company also engaged the financial advisory firms of morgan joseph co 
and ing capital llc morgan ing to review the new plan 
after thorough review of several strategic alternatives including the new business plan and after consultation with the morgan ing advisors  the company s board of directors approved the plan on march  subsequent to board approval  management initiated immediate implementation of the plan  which calls for closure of approximately of the company s operating stores 
in cases where those properties are owned by the company  the proceeds from the sale of the properties are being used to pay down bank debt under the existing agreement 
the first of those restaurants were closed by the end of fiscal most of the remaining locations are leased units that will close as soon as commercially feasible after negotiations with landlords or at the end of lease terms that expire in the near future 
with the assistance of morgan ing  the company continues to have constructive discussions with its credit facility lenders 
in the meantime  the company is focused on day to day operations and the implementation of its new strategic plan 
initially  cash resources have been reduced pursuant to the new plan  especially relative to lease settlements and termination costs 
the company used part of its fiscal federal income tax refund of million to support cash needs during the initial stages of the plan 
over a time span starting in the third quarter of fiscal through the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company expects to report net losses from discontinued operations  including charges for impairments and store closures due to its decision to close the locations specified in the new business plan 
to date through the fiscal year end  million has been incurred 
in fiscal year  the company expects more carrying and settlement costs  however  it also expects that these amounts will ultimately be offset by certain property gains through the next fiscal year 
through the end of fiscal  the company recorded noncash impairment charges of approximately million  which were included in discontinued operations 
the assets of these individual operating units have been written down to their net realizable values and are being actively marketed for sale 
the impairment charges were reduced by million in gains on the sale of certain properties held for sale as part of the new business plan 
the company also recorded the related fiscal year to date net operating results  employee terminations  lease settlements  and basic carrying costs of the closed units in discontinued operations 
the company also incurred approximately million in impairment costs that were charged to continuing operations 
the impairments in this category were slightly offset by  in gains on the sale of other properties held for sale 
the net amount primarily reflects either impairments on properties designated for closure under the new business plan but not yet closed or impairments on properties included in prior disposal plans 
relative to the latter  most properties designated for closure prior to the new business plan were primarily lease locations 
those impairments were computed with the aid of discounted cash flow models that were consistent with prior years 
the reserve for store closures balance as of august   related to the asset disposal plan 
credit facility debt at august   the company had a credit facility balance of million with the bank group a syndicate of four banks 
in accordance with provisions of that credit facility  the company paid the outstanding balance down by million during fiscal primarily from proceeds received from the sale of real and personal property 
as a result  the balance was lowered to million at the end of fiscal the interest rate was prime plus and prime plus at august   and august   respectively 
the company is current on all interest payments due under the credit facility 
as of august   million of the company s total book value  or of its total assets  including the company s owned real estate  improvements  equipment  and fixtures  was pledged as collateral under the credit facility 
although the current lenders have reserved all of their rights and remedies as a result of the january   default including the right to demand immediate repayment of the entire outstanding balance or the right to pursue foreclosure on the assets pledged as collateral they have not announced any intention to take such action 
subordinated debt on march   the company s ceo and coo  christopher j 
pappas and harris j 
pappas  respectively  committed to lending the company a total of million in exchange for convertible subordinated notes that were funded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the notes  as formally executed  bore interest at libor plus  payable quarterly 
the subordinated notes include a cross default provision that is tied to the company s credit facility 
the company was notified of the declared default by the note holders just after the end of the third quarter of fiscal also pursuant to the terms of the note  it was determined that the quarterly interest payment made effective march   could not be retained by the note holders  who in turn forwarded the payment of approximately  to the bank group 
that amount was applied to the principal of the credit facility after the end of the third quarter 
furthermore  no principal or interest payments may be made to the subordinated note holders while the credit facility debt is in default 
this restriction in turn caused a second default 
the note holders waived all defaults through may   yet they have reserved all of their rights and remedies associated with the debt 
effective may   the notes bear interest at per year 
even if the company s performance covenants are cured under the senior credit facility  continuation of the default with respect to the subordinated notes will continue to result in a default on the senior indebtedness under existing cross default provisions 
notwithstanding any accrued interest that may also be converted to stock  the notes are convertible into the company s common stock at per share for million shares at the option of the holders at any time after january   and prior to the stated redemption date 
the per share market price of the company s stock on the commitment date as determined by the closing price on the new york stock exchange on the date of issue was 
the difference between the market price and strike price of  or per share  multiplied by the million convertible shares equaled approximately million 
under the company s adopted intrinsic value method  applicable accounting principles require that this amount  which represents the beneficial conversion feature  be recorded as both a component of paid in capital and a discount from the million 
initially  the conversion feature was amortized over the ten year term of the notes 
the subordinated note defaults triggered an acceleration of the discount amortization over the remaining term of the senior debt  which is currently set to mature in october that shorter amortization time frame was determined to be appropriate as the notes are subordinate to the credit facility and  accordingly  no payoff of those notes could occur before the debt of the senior creditors is addressed 
the carrying value of the notes at august   net of the unamortized discount  was approximately million 
the comparative carrying value of the notes at august   was approximately million 
commitments and contingencies in fiscal  the company guaranteed loans of approximately million relating to purchases of luby s stock by various officers of the company pursuant to the terms of a shareholder approved plan 
under the officer loan program  shares were purchased and funding was obtained from jpmorgan chase bank  one of the four members of the bank group that participate in the company s credit facility 
per the original terms of the agreements  these instruments only required annual interest to be paid by the individual debtors  with the entire principal balances due upon their respective maturity dates  which occur during the period from january through march of  unless extended by the note holders 
at both august   and august   the notes had a combined outstanding balance of approximately million 
the underlying guarantee on these loans includes a cross default provision 
the company received notice from jpmorgan chase bank that the default in the company s credit facility led to a default in the officer loans 
jpmorgan chase bank initially requested that the company repurchase the notes  however  such action cannot be completed without comprehensive resolution with the entire bank group 
on july   jpmorgan chase bank notified the company that although it continues to reserve all rights and remedies  it has not elected to pursue those rights and remedies in order to allow further discussions among the bank group 
this notice did not constitute a waiver 
the company is therefore working constructively with all members of the bank group in an effort to cure all defaults and satisfactorily mee t each lender s expectations 
in the event of individual debtor default  the company could be required to purchase the loans from jpmorgan chase bank  become holder of the notes  record the receivables  and pursue collection 
the purchased company stock has been and can be used by borrowers to satisfy a portion of their loan obligation 
as of august   based on the market price on that day  approximately  or of the note balances  could have been covered by stock  while approximately million  or  would have remained outstanding 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet structured financing arrangements 
the shareholder approved guaranteed loans  as described above  were intended to encourage officer stock ownership 
under the terms of applicable sec rules  the company s obligation to repurchase the loans could be deemed a guarantee contract  which the sec considers an off balance sheet arrangement 
if the company is required to purchase the loans  it would have to expend approximately million to do so 
the company expects that the borrowers will fully repay the obligations 
however  since management is currently unable to determine the individual ability of each borrower to pay the underlying debt in full  it is difficult to assess the potential effect on liquidity 
affiliate services the company entered into an affiliate services agreement effective august   with two companies  pappas partners  lp and pappas restaurants  inc  which are restaurant entities owned by christopher j 
pappas and harris j 
pappas 
that agreement  as amended on july   limited the scope of expenditures therein to professional and consulting services 
the company completed this amendment due to a significant decline in the use of professional and consulting services from pappas entities 
additionally  on july   the company entered into a master sales agreement with the same pappas entities 
through this agreement  the company contractually separated the design and fabrication of equipment and furnishings from the affiliate services agreement 
the master sales agreement covers the costs incurred for modifications to existing equipment  as well as custom fabrication  including stainless steel stoves  shelving  rolling carts  and chef tables 
these items are custom designed and built to fit the designated kitchens and are also engineered to give a longer service life than comparably manufactured equipment 
the pricing of equipment  repair  and maintenance is set and evaluated periodically and is considered by management to be primarily at or below market for comparable goods and services 
to assist in periodically monitoring pricing of the transactions associated with the master sales agreement and the affiliate services agreement  the finance and audit committee of the company s board of directors has periodically in the past used independent valuation consultants 
as part of the affiliation with the pappas entities  the company leases a facility  the houston service center  in which luby s has installed a centralized restaurant service center to support field operations 
the building at this location has  square feet of warehouse space and  square feet of office space 
it is leased from the pappas entities by the company at an approximate monthly rate of per square foot 
from this center  luby s repair and service teams are dispatched to the company s restaurants when facility or equipment maintenance and servicing are needed 
the facility is also used for repair and storage of new and used equipment 
the company previously leased a location from an unrelated third party 
that location is used to house increased equipment inventories due to store closures under the business plan 
the company considered it more prudent to lease this location rather than to pursue purchasing a storage facility  as its strategy is to focus its capital expenditures on the its operating restaurants 
in a separate transaction  the third party property owner sold the location to the pappas entities during the fourth quarter of fiscal  with the pappas entities becoming the company s landlord for that location 
the storage site complements the houston service center with approximately  square feet of warehouse space at an approximate monthly rate of per square foot 
in another separate contract  pursuant to the terms of a ground lease dated march   the company paid rent to phcg investments for a luby s restaurant the company operated in dallas  texas  until that location was closed early in the third quarter of fiscal christopher j 
pappas and harris j 
pappas are general partners of phcg investments 
preceding the store s closure  the company entered into a lease termination agreement with a third party unaffiliated with the pappas entities 
that agreement severed the company s interest in the phcg property in exchange for a payment of cash to the company 
the company also obtained the right to remove fixtures and equipment from the premises  and it was released from any future obligations under the lease agreement 
the closing of the transaction was completed during the third quarter of fiscal  resulting in a gain of  and the gross proceeds were used to pay down debt 
the amount paid by the company pursuant to the terms of this lease before its termination was approximately  and  for the years ended august   and august   respectively 
affiliated rents paid for the houston service center  the separate storage facility  and the dallas property leases combined represented and of total rents for continuing operations for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the following compares current and prior fiscal year charges incurred under the master sales agreement  the affiliate services agreement  and affiliated property leases to the company s total general and administrative expenses  capital expenditures  and occupancy and other operating expenses included in continuing operations year ended august  august  days days in thousands affiliate services and sales incurred costs general and administrative expenses professional services capital expenditures custom fabricated and refurbished equipment occupancy and other operating expenses  including property leases less pass through amounts to third parties total applicable total company costs general and administrative expenses capital expenditures occupancy and other operating expenses total affiliate services incurred costs as a percentage of applicable total company costs year to date inception to date trends and uncertainties same store sales the restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to food quality  concept  location  price  and service 
the company has experienced declining same store sales since as a result of previous execution strategies  as well as increased industry wide competition 
the company competes with a large number of other restaurants  many of which have greater financial resources 
management believes the company s success will depend largely on its ability to execute its new strategies  optimize its financial resources  and respond to changes in consumer preferences  as well as to general economic conditions 
the following shows the quarterly comparative change in same store sales q q q q fiscal fiscal fiscal average adjusted for leap year 
the company enacted price increases in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the first quarter of fiscal includes september  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company was able to maintain its comparative cash flow level with declining sales by lowering operating costs 
even with national economic issues  such as continued concerns about domestic terrorism and a military offensive overseas  there was less quarterly same store sales variability in fiscal than in the prior fiscal year 
the company may find additional opportunities to lower costs  however  continued declines in net same store sales could reduce operating cash flow 
if severe declines in cash flow were to develop without offsetting reductions in uses of cash  such as capital expenditures  the company s liquidity  the current status of the company s credit facility  and the ability of the company to refinance its indebtedness could be further impacted 
as a possible result  the current lenders may choose to terminate the credit facility  accelerate the maturity of any outstanding obligation under that facility  and pursue foreclosure on assets pledged as collateral 
new programs in addition to those described earlier  the company has initiated a number of programs since march these programs  as listed below  are intended to address the decline in total and same store sales  while prudently managing costs and increasing overall profitability food excellence  service excellence  emphasis on value  including all you can eat promotions  increased emphasis on employee training and development  targeted marketing  especially directed at families  closure of certain underperforming restaurants  new concept conversions  and continued emphasis on in house safety training  accident prevention  and claims management 
impairment statement of financial accounting standards sfas requires the company to review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company considers a history of operating losses or negative cash flows and unfavorable changes in market conditions to be its main indicators of potential impairment 
assets are generally evaluated for impairment at the restaurant level 
if a restaurant does not meet its financial investment objectives or continues to incur negative cash flows or operating losses  an impairment charge may be recognized in future periods 
insurance and claims workers compensation and employee injury claims expense decreased in comparison with the prior fiscal year due to improved cost control  safety training and accident prevention efforts  as well as the management of new claims in house 
actual claims settlements and expenses may differ from estimated loss provisions 
the company cannot make any assurances as to the ultimate level of claims under the in house safety program or whether declines in incidence of claims as well as claims costs experienced under the program will continue in future periods 
the company may be the subject of claims or litigation from guests and employees alleging injuries as a result of its operations 
in addition  unfavorable publicity from such allegations could have an adverse impact on financial results  regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome 
minimum wage and labor costs from time to time  the us congress considers an increase in the federal minimum wage 
the restaurant industry is intensely competitive  and in such case  the company may not be able to transfer all of the resulting increases in operating costs to its guests in the form of price increases 
in addition  since the company s business is labor intensive  shortages in the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs 
reserve for restaurant closings the company s reserve for restaurant closings is associated with prior disposal plans 
the reserve declined from million at august   to million at august   primarily due to the payment of and reductions in certain accrued lease settlement costs of approximately million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company has identified the following policies as critical to its business and the understanding of its results of operations 
the company believes it is improbable that materially different amounts would be reported relating to the accounting policies described below if other acceptable approaches were adopted 
however  the application of these accounting policies  as described below  involve the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  therefore  actual results could differ from estimates generated from their use 
income taxes the company records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carrybacks and carryforwards 
the company periodically reviews the recoverability of tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary 
management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability 
in addition  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years 
historically  the company has been periodically reviewed by the internal revenue service 
the company is currently under review for the   and fiscal years 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing impairment reviews of such restaurants  the company estimates future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and the possible residual value associated with its eventual disposition 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
the company considers the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
property held for sale the company also periodically reviews long lived assets against its plans to retain or ultimately dispose of properties 
if the company decides to dispose of a property  it will be moved to property held for sale and actively marketed 
property held for sale is stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
the net realizable value is generally estimated by management based upon the specific circumstance of each location 
the company will periodically measure and analyze its estimates against third party appraisals 
insurance and claims the company periodically reviews its workers compensation and general liability reserves to ensure reasonableness 
in fiscal  the company initiated an in house safety and claims program focused on safety training and rigorous scrutiny of new claims  which has reduced costs significantly 
consistent with the prior year  the company s liability is based upon estimates obtained from both an actuarial firm and internal risk management staff 
assumptions and judgments are used in evaluating these costs 
the possibility exists that future claims related liabilities could increase due to unforeseen circumstances 
stock based compensation the company accounts for its employee stock compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and the related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company s stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
new accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company was required to adopt sfas as of august  the adoption of sfas extended the reporting of discontinued operations to all components of an entity from a segment of an entity 
in the current year  all qualifying disposal plans were reported as discontinued operations  and operations related to those disposals in prior years were reclassified as required 
the results of disposal plans prior to the adoption were included in continuing operations for all periods presented 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized only when the liability is incurred that is  when it meets the definition of a liability in the fasb s conceptual framework 
sfas also establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal activities 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company adopted sfas in the first quarter of fiscal in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
for certain guarantees issued after december   fin requires a guarantor to recognize  upon issuance of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee 
guarantees issued prior to january   are not subject to liability recognition  but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements 
the company does not believe that the adoption of this interpretation has had a material effect on its consolidated financial position or statement of operations 
in january  fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 which requires the company to consolidate variable interest entities for which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which it has a significant variable interest 
fin became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after january   and effective for periods ending after december   for any variable interest entities formed prior to february  the company does not believe that this interpretation will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which requires that the extinguishment of debt not be considered an extraordinary item under apb opinion no
