item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview american dental partners  inc adpi is a leading provider of business services to multi disciplinary dental groups in selected markets throughout the united states 
we are committed to the growth and success of our affiliated dental groups  and we make substantial investments to support each affiliated dental group s growth 
we assist our affiliates with organizational planning and development  recruiting  retention and training programs  quality assurance initiatives  facilities development and management  employee benefits administration  procurement  information systems  marketing and payor relations  and financial planning  reporting and analysis 
at december   we were affiliated with dental groups  comprising dentists practicing in locations in states 
affiliation and acquisition summary when affiliating with a dental group  we acquire selected assets and enter into a long term service agreement with the affiliated dental group or professional corporation pc 
under our service agreements  we are responsible for providing all services necessary for the administration of the non clinical aspects of the dental operations 
the pc is responsible for the provision of dental care 
each of our service agreements is for an initial term of years 
during  and  we completed nine  three and four transactions in which we acquired non clinical dental assets  respectively  and simultaneously entered into year service agreements in three of these transactions the assets of of the transactions were combined with existing affiliated dental groups 
in total  these affiliations resulted in the addition of dental facilities and operatories 
in addition during  we acquired the outstanding stock of a dental laboratory and selected assets of a second laboratory 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on acquisitions and affiliations 
while we are continually evaluating new affiliation or acquisition opportunities  we expect that the number of new affiliations over the next twelve months will be at levels we have achieved during the past two years rather than the overall pace since our founding 
as a result  we expect our growth to come primarily from our existing affiliates 
affiliate adjusted gross revenue  net revenue and total revenue affiliate adjusted gross revenue and payor mix we do not own nor control the affiliated dental groups and  accordingly  do not consolidate the financial statements of the pcs with ours 
our affiliated dental groups generate revenue from patients and dental benefit providers under fee for service  ppo and capitated managed care plans 
the affiliated dental groups record revenue at established rates reduced by contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts to arrive at adjusted gross revenue 
contractual adjustments represent the difference between gross billable charges at established rates and the portion of those charges reimbursed pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts 
while payor mix varies from market to market  the aggregate payor mix percentage of our affiliated dental groups for the year ended december  was approximately fee for service  ppo plans and capitated managed care plans 
the pcs reimburse us for expenses incurred on their behalf in connection with the operation and administration of the dental facilities and pay fees to us for business services 
expenses incurred for the operation and administration of the dental facilities include salaries and benefits for non dentist personnel working at the dental facilities the administrative staff and  where permitted by law  the dental assistants and hygienists  lab fees  dental supplies  office occupancy costs of the dental facilities  depreciation related to the fixed assets at the dental facilities and other expenses such as professional fees  marketing costs and general and administrative expenses 
see business operations operating structure 
after reimbursement of expenses and payment of service fees to the company  the amounts retained by the pcs include compensation of dentists and in certain states where the pcs must employ dental hygienists and or dental assistants  compensation of such non dentist employees

under certain service agreements  the company s service fee consists of a variable monthly fee which is based upon a specified percentage of the amount by which the pc s adjusted gross revenue exceeds expenses incurred in connection with the operation and administration of the dental facilities 
under certain service agreements  the company s service fees consist of a fixed monthly fee and an additional variable fee 
to the extent that there is operating income after payment of the fixed monthly fee  reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with the operation and administration of the dental facilities and payment of provider expenses  an additional variable fee is paid to the company in the amount of such excess up to budgeted operating income and a percentage of such excess over budgeted operating income 
under certain service agreements  the company s service fee consists entirely of a fixed monthly fee 
the fixed monthly fees are determined by agreement of the company and the affiliated dental groups in a formal budgeting process 
as part of the company s objective of being the leading provider of services to dental group practices  we are continually expanding our resources and capabilities  including vertical integration of ancillary dental activities 
the company works with and receives fees from dental benefit providers on behalf of its affiliates to arrange programs for the provision of care to their patients 
in  the company acquired two dental laboratories to expand its procurement capabilities 
although the dental laboratories continue to have revenue from unaffiliated dentists  the company expects that the growth of both of these activities will come primarily from the growth of its affiliated dental groups 
total revenue although the company does not own its affiliated pcs and  therefore  does not recognize revenue associated with providing care to patients in its financial statements  the expenses the company incurs are related to supporting the provision of patient care 
in order to analyze the company s income statements  including growth in net revenue and operating expense trends  we believe that it is necessary to analyze total revenue  including the adjusted gross revenue of its affiliated dental groups and other revenues of the company 
the following table sets forth for  and  the components of total revenue  a reconciliation of total revenue to net revenue and the percentage of total revenue for items in the company s consolidated statements of income in thousands of of of total total total revenue revenue revenue adjusted gross revenue affiliated dental groups unaudited

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the managed care contract terminations 
the increase in was primarily the result of new affiliations and the acquisition of dental laboratories offset by the disruption of business associated with the managed care contract terminations 
same affiliate growth was in and excluding the effect of the managed care contract terminations was 
amounts retained by affiliated dental groups unaudited amounts retained by affiliated dental groups increased from  in to  in and to  in the increase in and was due to new affiliations  greater number of groups employing hygienists and or dental assistants and increasing doctor compensation 
since  we have entered into affiliation transactions with a number of dental practices located in states where dental hygienists and dental assistants are required to be employed by the pcs 
in recent years  due to the growth in demand for dental services exceeding the growth in the supply of dentists nationally  dentist compensation has been increasing generally and for our affiliated dental groups specifically 
we expect this trend to moderate 
as a result of these two factors  the amounts retained by affiliated dental groups as a percentage of total revenue has increased from to in and in net revenue net revenue increased from  in to  in and to  in the increase in net revenue in was due to entering into service agreements in connection with affiliation transactions  along with same market growth from dental groups which were our affiliates during the entirety of and this was offset by the disruption and loss of business associated with contract terminations related to our affiliation with associated dental care providers  which resulted in a decrease in net revenue of  as compared to the increase in net revenue in was due to entering into service agreements in connection with affiliation transactions and revenues generated from two dental laboratories acquired during the year 
net revenue derived from our service agreement with park dental represented approximately  and of our consolidated net revenue for  and  respectively 
no other service agreement or customers related to other revenue accounted for greater than of consolidated net revenue 
salaries and benefits expense salaries and benefits expense includes costs for personnel working for us at the dental facilities as well as local and regional management 
at the facility level  we generally employ the administrative staff and  where permitted by state law  the dental assistants and hygenists 
the local and regional operating management teams supervise and support the staff at the dental facilities 
salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased from in to in to in the decreases were primarily related to the reduction in staff and administrative positions at two affiliates as a result of managed contract terminations during the reduction is partially offset by wage inflation 
we expect salaries and benefits expense in to stay consistent as a percentage of total revenue as compared to due to a combination of increases in benefits costs offset by controlling the level of wage increases 
the company made payments to providers related to the arrangement of the provision of care to patients  which include payments made directly to the company s affiliated dental groups 
the company made payments of   and  during  and  respectively  of which   and  was paid to its affiliated dental groups 
lab fees and dental supplies expense lab fees and dental supplies expense varies from affiliate to affiliate and is affected by the volume and type of procedures performed 
lab fees and dental supplies expense as a percentage of total revenue increased from in to in and in the increases were due to price increases from certain lab and supply manufactures along with a change in mix of the type of procedures performed 
we are continuing our efforts to offset dental supply manufacturer price increases with the economies of scale through our national dental supply purchasing and rebate programs 
office occupancy expense office occupancy expense includes rent expense and certain other operating costs such as utilities associated with dental facilities and the local administrative offices 
such costs vary based on the size of each facility and the market rental rate for dental office space in each particular geographic market 
office occupancy expense as a percentage of total revenue increased from in to in and in the increases were primarily as a result of the investment in the relocation and addition of new dental facilities and a decrease in facility utilization as a result of the managed care contract terminations at three of our affiliates in in  we added one new facility and relocated and or expanded fifteen facilities 
in  we added three new facilities and relocated and or expanded nine facilities 
in  we added one new facility and relocated and or expanded ten facilities 
this net investment in facilities increased our physical capacity to allow for future growth 
we expect office occupancy expense to continue to increase as we invest in the relocation and expansion of dental facilities  resulting in similar expense as a percentage of total revenue in the excess capacity arising from the contract terminations will likely continue at associated dental care providers in the near future 
other operating expenses other operating expenses include insurance expense  professional fees  marketing costs and other general and administrative expenses 
other operating expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue from in to in to in the increases were primarily due to the impact of the lost business associated with the managed care contract terminations in and and  of unusual expenses in related to costs associated with increased patient communications  deinstallation of certain computer equipment and the relocation of certain resource center personnel see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  other operating expense may increase due to increased insurance costs  however  we hope to offset these increases with continued management of discretionary spending 
general corporate expenses general corporate expenses consist of compensation expenses for our corporate personnel and administrative staff  as well as facility and other administrative costs of our corporate office 
general corporate expenses as a percentage of total revenue were in and and in general corporate expenses in included  of unusual expenses associated with the restructuring of management 
these costs included separation and relocation of certain management personnel see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the level of general corporate expenses may continue to increase in the future as we continue to expand our management infrastructure 
depreciation depreciation expense includes charges related to leasehold improvements and furniture  fixtures and equipment used to operate the dental facilities  lab facilities  local and regional management offices and our corporate office 
depreciation expense as a percentage of total revenue was in and and in in  we added one new facility and relocated and or expanded ten facilities resulting in additional depreciation 
this increase was offset by some of our assets becoming fully depreciated during the year  causing overall depreciation expense to decrease as a percentage of total revenue in we expect to continue to invest in the relocation and expansion of our physical capacity 
accordingly  depending on the amount and timing of such future capital expenditures  depreciation could increase 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets amortization as a percentage of total revenue was in and  and decreased to in amortization in was impacted by the non amortization of goodwill of  offset by amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded in connection with the seven affiliation transactions and two acquisitions completed in and management continually evaluates the appropriateness of the useful lives of its intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets could increase in the future as a result of definite lived intangibles recorded in connection with future acquisitions and affiliations 
special charges special charges represent a provision for costs associated with reductions in physical capacity at associated dental care providers and patient communications at associated dental care provider and park dental  as a result of the managed care contract terminations 
these costs include facility closure and lease exit costs of three dental offices in phoenix and regional resource centers  employee termination costs  patient communication and other expenses 
for further information on these special charges  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense  net net interest expense decreased from  in to  in to  in the decrease in was due to a lower overall interest rate  partially offset by twelve months of increased financing costs associated with amending our revolving credit facility in july compared to six months of financing costs in the decrease in was due to a lower overall interest rate and a lower average debt balance compared to the prior year 
income taxes our effective tax rate was approximately for and and in the effective tax rate in decreased from the rate primarily due to fluctuations in taxable income in various states in which we operate and the elimination of certain permanent differences between the financial statement and tax treatment of goodwill amortization 
we anticipate that the effective tax rate for to be similar to the rate in liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operating and capital needs  including cash used for acquisitions and affiliations  capital expenditures and working capital  from sales of equity securities  borrowings under our revolving line of credit and cash generated from operations 
from january  through december   we completed four dental practice affiliations and acquired the outstanding stock of one dental laboratory and selected assets of a second dental laboratory for aggregate consideration of  in cash   in subordinated promissory notes   in deferred payments and a future contingent payment for one affiliation based on a multiple of earnings before interest and taxes in excess of a predetermined threshold for the year ending december  for the years ended december  and  cash provided by operating activities amounted to  and  respectively 
in  cash from operations primarily resulted from net earnings after adding back non cash items  partially offset by an increase in receivables due from affiliated dental groups  a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits accounts and payments of special charges of  the increase in receivables due from affiliated dental groups of  was caused by a shift in payor mix from capitated managed care plans to claims based reimbursement and reduced profit from affiliates negatively impacted by the managed care contract terminations 
in  cash from operations primarily resulted from increased net earnings after adding back non cash items and a decrease in receivables due from affiliated dental groups  partially offset by payments of special charges of  the decrease of  in receivables due from affiliated dental groups was due to stability in payor mix from the prior year and a reduction in patient receivables at our affiliated dental groups as a result of increased focus on receivables management 
for the years ended december  and  cash used in investing activities amounted to  and  respectively 
cash used for investing activities included cash for affiliations and capital expenditures 
cash used for affiliations  net of cash acquired  was  and  for and  respectively 
capital expenditures were  and  for and  respectively 
capital expenditures for included costs associated with the addition of three new dental facilities and the relocation and or expansion of nine dental facilities  as compared to one new dental facility and the relocation and or expansion of ten dental facilities in we expect that capital expenditures in to be higher than in past years due to the relocation of three dental facilities  combining our two dental laboratories into one new laboratory  expansion of several additional dental facilities  our on going facility maintenance capital expenditure program and investment in several information technology projects 
for the years ended december  and  cash used for financing activities amounted to  and  respectively 
cash used for financing activities in resulted from the repayment of indebtedness of  and the repurchase of  shares of common stock for  offset by the net borrowings under our revolving line of credit of  proceeds from the issuance of common stock for the employee stock purchase plan and from stock option exercises of  and  respectively 
cash used for financing activities in resulted from the repayment of indebtedness of  and net repayments under our revolving line of credit of  offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock for the employee stock purchase plan and from stock option exercises of  and  respectively 
the company has a million credit facility that is being used for general corporate purposes  including affiliations and capital expenditures 
borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at either prime or libor plus a margin  at our option 
the margin is based upon our debt coverage ratio and ranges from to for prime loans and to for libor loans 
in addition  we pay a commitment fee which ranges from to of the average daily balance of the unused line 
borrowings are limited to an availability formula based on adjusted ebitda 
the credit facility is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets  including a pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries 
we are also required to comply with certain financial and other covenants 
the line of credit matures in july the outstanding balance under this line as of december  was  the unused balance at december  was  and based on borrowing covenants  was available for borrowing 
we have a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission registration no 
covering a total of  shares of common stock and  aggregate principal amount of subordinated promissory notes to be issued in connection with future dental practice affiliations and acquisitions 
as of december    shares and  of notes remain available for issuance under this shelf registration statement 
our growth to date has resulted in large measure from our ability to affiliate with additional dental practices 
although we have affiliated with many dental practices since our initial affiliation in november  there can be no assurance that future potential affiliations consummated can successfully be integrated into our operations 
historically  we have used a combination of cash  common stock and subordinated debt as consideration for past affiliations and acquisitions and plan to use these sources in the future 
in recent years  the consideration paid has consisted of cash and subordinated debt 
in the event that our common stock does not maintain sufficient valuation or if potential affiliation or acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept our securities as consideration  we will continue to use cash resources to for future affiliations and acquisitions 
in addition  if sufficient financing is not available as needed on terms acceptable to us  our affiliation and acquisition strategy will be modified 
while we are continually evaluating new affiliation or acquisition opportunities  it is expected that the number of new affiliations and acquisitions over the next twelve months will be at levels we have achieved during the past two years rather than the overall pace since our founding 
as a result  we expect our growth to come from our existing affiliates 
any excess cash will be used to reduce indebtedness or to repurchase common stock through our previously announced repurchase program  pursuant to which approximately  remains available to repurchase additional shares 
we believe that cash generated from operations and amounts available under our current revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  affiliations and acquisitions for at least the next twelve months 
furthermore  we believe the amount available to borrow under our revolving credit facility covenant restrictions will increase throughout contractual obligations payable or maturing in the following years as of december  in thousands and and total thereafter long term debt obligations    capital lease obligations operating lease obligations      total gross obligations      operating lease obligations to be reimbursed under service agreements      total net obligations     critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis management evaluates its estimates  including those related to carrying value of receivables due from affiliated dental groups  goodwill and intangible assets and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 

valuation of receivables due from affiliated dental groups 
the company s carrying amount of receivables due from affiliated dental groups requires management to assess the collectibility of our business fees 
our fees are dependent on the collectibility of the pc s patient receivables  net of contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts 
the affiliated dental groups record revenue at established rates reduced by contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts to arrive at adjusted gross revenue 
contractual adjustments represent the difference between gross billable charges at established rates and the portion of those charges reimbursed pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts 
for contracts where there is no defined benefit  contractual adjustments are based upon historical collection experience and other relevant factors 
in the event that final reimbursement differs from original estimates  adjusted gross revenue could increase or decrease in future periods 
the affiliated dental groups provision for doubtful accounts is estimated in the period that services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as necessary 
the estimates for the provision and related allowance are based on an evaluation of historical collection experience  the aging profile of the accounts receivable  write off percentages and other relevant factors 
changes in these factors in future periods could result in increases or decreases in the provision 
we continuously assess the collectibility of patient receivables by reviewing contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts with the management of the pcs 
in addition  we review the economic viability of the pcs based on actual and forecasted results 
if a change in any of these factors results in a reduction of adjusted gross revenue in a future period  our ability to collect receivables due from affiliated dental groups could be impacted 
based upon our assessment of the pcs patient receivables and economic viability  we have not recorded any losses related to our receivables due from affiliated dental groups 

goodwill and intangible assets 
our business acquisitions and affiliations typically result in goodwill and intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we may incur 
the determination of the value of such goodwill and intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
as part of each acquisition and affiliation  we determine the amount of goodwill and intangible assets related to the transaction 
in determining the amount of goodwill related to acquisitions and intangible assets related to service agreements with affiliated dental groups  we estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in determining fair value  we review the balance sheet of the acquired company to ensure the reasonableness of the balances  including the collectibility of receivables  value of inventory on hand  replacement value and depreciable lives of property and equipment and appropriate level of accrued liabilities 
in determining the amount of intangible assets related to customer relationships as part of an acquisition  we estimate future discounted cash flows based on many factors  including historical and projected revenue streams and operating margins and customer attrition rates 
if the facts and circumstances change indicating that fair value of tangible net assets or intangible assets should change  future period results could be impacted 
for definite lived intangible assets  we evaluate the amortization period based on the facts and circumstances of each individual acquisition or affiliation 
our evaluation includes reviewing historical and projected operating results  dental benefit plan provider contracts  customer and patient stability and competition in the geographic area that we are entering  along with other relevant factors 
the initial amortization period for definite lived intangibles is generally to years 
if circumstances change  indicating a shorter estimated period of benefit  future amortization expense could increase 
management performs an impairment test on goodwill on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
we determine impairment by comparing the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting units 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows using a discount reflecting our average cost of funds 
if impairment were determined  we would make the appropriate adjustment to goodwill to reduce the asset s carrying value 
management performs an impairment test on definite lived intangibles when facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that the intangibles may be impaired  such as loss of key personnel  change in legal factors or competition 
we review the undiscounted net cash flows of the asset to the carrying value of the intangible asset 
if impairment was determined  we would make the appropriate adjustment to the intangible assets to reduce the asset s carrying value to fair value 
to date we have not recorded any impairment charges or write downs of goodwill and intangible assets 

income taxes 
under our income tax policy  we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as tax credit carryforwards 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary allowances as required under the guidelines of statement no

is based on the fundamental principle that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity should be recorded when it is incurred  that is  when it meets the definition of a liability in fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements  and can be measured at fair value 
the principal reason for issuing statement no 
is the board s belief that some liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities that entities record under current accounting pronouncements  in particular eitf issue  do not meet the definition of a liability 
statement no 
nullifies eitf issue  thus  it will have a significant effect on practice because commitment to an exit or disposal plan no longer will be a sufficient basis for recording a liability for costs related to those activities 
statement no 
is effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  an entity would continue to apply the provisions of eitf issue to an exit activity that it initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of eitf issue before the entity initially applied statement no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
with regard to our revolving credit facility  we are also exposed to variable rate interest for the banks applicable margins  ranging from to based upon our debt coverage ratio 
as a result of amending our revolving credit facility in july  the banks margin increased by from historical levels 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair value but do not impact earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flow 
we do not believe a one percentage point change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair market value of our fixed rate debt 
the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact for one year based upon the amounts outstanding at december  under our variable rate revolving credit facility for each one percentage point change in interest rates would be approximately  per annum 
we do not presently undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not party to any interest rate risk management transactions
