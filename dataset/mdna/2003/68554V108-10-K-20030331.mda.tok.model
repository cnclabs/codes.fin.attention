statements below regarding future events or performance are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of our actual results could be quite different from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
factors that could affect results are discussed more fully under the sections entitled  forward looking statements and risk factors  in item and elsewhere in this report 
although forward looking statements help to provide complete information about us  readers should keep in mind that forward looking statements may not be reliable 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements contained herein and the notes thereto  along with the section entitled  critical accounting policies and estimates set forth below 
results of operations compared to total revenues decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in the decline in revenues was primarily the result of a million decrease in licensing and product development revenues  partially offset by higher product revenues 
product revenues were approximately million in  representing an increase of over levels 
the table below shows the amount of our total revenues in thousands  except generated in each of our principal markets and by licensing and product development activities 
dollars percentage change inc dec 
percentage of total revenues market revenues insurance risk assessment infectious disease testing substance abuse testing physicians office therapies licensing and product development total revenues sales to the insurance risk assessment market increased by to approximately million in from approximately million in  as a result of increased sales of our orasure laboratory based hiv test  partially offset by lower sales of assays and reagents 
we expect that sales of our insurance assays and reagents will come under increased competitive pressure in the future 
the laboratories that purchase these products are facing pressure from their insurance customers to reduce the cost of testing services 
as a result  these laboratories are expected to reduce their purchases of our products and instead use lower cost internally developed assays or reagents or testing products purchased from our competitors 
although we will make every effort to retain this business  our revenues could be negatively impacted by as much as million in and million in  when compared to revenues in the insurance risk assessment market 
sales to the infectious disease testing market increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  as a result of a million increase in sales of our orasure laboratory based hiv test into the public health market  offset by a  decrease in international sales of the oraquick rapid hiv antibody test 
in june  we entered into an agreement with abbott laboratories for the co exclusive distribution of the oraquick test in the united states 
we received fda approval of the oraquick test for detecting hiv in finger stick whole blood samples in november and received a clia waiver for this product in january 
table of contents we shipped an initial order for approximately  of oraquick devices to abbott in the fourth quarter of  representing our first domestic sale of this product following fda approval 
we expect that sales of oraquick will increase substantially in  the first full year that this product is commercially available in the united states 
we expect that abbott will purchase at least million of oraquick devices during the first months of our agreement  which is the minimum purchase commitment required to retain co exclusive distribution rights 
additionally  we expect that sales of the oraquick device in the public health and military markets will increase throughout the year as acceptance of this product grows 
sales of our orasure laboratory based hiv test are expected to be negatively affected by the successful penetration of the oraquick device in the public health market  as some customers will likely substitute oraquick for orasure 
however  the degree of this substitution and resulting financial impact cannot be determined at this time 
international sales of oraquick are also expected to contribute to our revenues in the infectious disease testing market in sales to the substance abuse testing market decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in  primarily as a result of the absence of million in sales of laboratory equipment manufactured by third party vendors and million in sales of uplink analyzers  which occurred in offsetting this aggregate decrease were an approximate  increase in international sales of our intercept collection device and related assays and an approximate  increase in sales of domestic substance abuse products 
we intend to aggressively support our intercept product line in through the deployment of additional sales representatives and increased marketing expenditures 
sales to the physicians office therapies market  which consisted solely of our histofreezer wart removal system  increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  as a result of increased product sales in the united states partially offset by lower international sales 
the increase in domestic sales of histofreezer was partially attributable to distributors increasing their inventory levels in the fourth quarter of as a result of an announced price increase in the us market  which became effective in december this increase in inventory levels in advance of the price increase is expected to reduce histofreezer product sales during the first quarter of however  we believe that histofreezer sales levels in the us will return to a more normal pattern beginning in the second and third quarters of we are evaluating distribution channel expansion for our histofreezer product line in order to expand our penetration of the physicians offices therapies market  and are considering selling histofreezer in certain other markets not covered by our current distribution partners 
as a percentage of total revenues  international revenues decreased to approximately in from approximately in  with histofreezer accounting for approximately of international revenues 
this decrease is primarily attributable to lower international sales of oraquick and the absence of uplink analyzer sales to dr ger safety  which occurred in labone  our largest customer  and osborne group  which was acquired by labone in  together accounted for approximately and of total revenues in and  respectively 
we expect this percentage to decrease further in  reflecting lower anticipated sales of insurance assays and reagents to labone and increased sales of the oraquick rapid hiv antibody test  as described above 
licensing and product development revenues decreased to approximately  in from approximately million in  reflecting a significant drop in funded research and development 
during  licensing and product development revenues were primarily derived from the continued development of the uplink drugs of abuse rapid detection system under our agreement with dr ger safety  development of infectious disease applications for uplink under our agreement with meridian bioscience  and the second phase of a grant from the national institutes of health nih for the development of an oral fluid syphilis test 
the decrease in resulted from the absence of research and development funding from both dr ger safety and meridian  as our projects with these companies advanced to a stage where we became responsible for funding  and the termination of work under the nih grant for the development of the syphilis test 

table of contents we do not expect significant research and development funding from dr ger safety in and we agreed in principle to terminate our agreement with meridian in early however  we expect licensing and product development revenues to increase modestly in as a result of approximately  in annual research and development funding expected under our collaborative uplink and oral fluid research project with the university of pennsylvania  which will be received under a grant awarded by the nih 
our gross margin decreased to approximately in from in this decrease was primarily the result of lower licensing and product development revenues  offset by a more favorable product mix and our ongoing cost savings efforts 
additionally  as we prepared for fda approval and the commercial launch of oraquick in the united states during  we incurred substantial expenses related to staffing  materials and overhead 
these expenses were included in our cost of goods throughout  however  we did not begin to generate revenues from oraquick until the initial sales of this product in the united states in december we anticipate that the benefits of these expenditures will be realized during and that the incremental revenues associated with the production and sale of oraquick will positively impact our gross margin in the future 
we also recognized approximately million of inventory scrap in and are implementing programs designed to reduce scrap levels in we expect that these programs will also help improve our gross margin in and beyond 
research and development expenses declined to approximately million in from approximately million in decreased expenditures for staffing  consulting and travel were partially offset by increased clinical trials costs related to our efforts to obtain fda approval of the oraquick rapid hiv antibody test 
we expect that our expenditures in support of regulatory filings for our products will increase in  primarily related to clinical trials for the clia waiver and the oral fluid and certain other claims for oraquick and the transfer of manufacturing from our beaverton  oregon facilities to bethlehem  pennsylvania 
sales and marketing expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was primarily the result of additional consulting fees for the development of our strategic marketing plans and increased staffing costs  offset by lower travel expenses  sales commissions and freight costs 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase substantially in as we support the launch of oraquick and invest in the promotion of our intercept products 
we plan to increase our staffing levels in support of these  and other key products  and to incur higher related expenses for travel  sales commissions  advertising and public relations 
general and administrative expenses declined to approximately million in from approximately million in this decrease was primarily the result of lower legal  recruiting  and staffing costs offset by an approximate million severance charge related to the departure of our former chief executive officer in the first quarter of additionally  we had an approximate  loss on disposal of equipment in  which we did not have in we expect general and administrative costs to increase during  reflecting additional facility related costs from the occupancy of our new corporate headquarters in bethlehem  pennsylvania  higher premium costs for directors and officers liability insurance  and higher professional advisor fees as a result of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of restructuring related expenses were approximately million in these costs included expenses for employee severance and travel and transport resulting from relocating and consolidating manufacturing operations 
there were no such costs in interest expense decreased by to  in from  in  as a result of lower average outstanding borrowings and lower effective interest rates 
interest income decreased by to  in from  in  as a result of lower cash and cash equivalents available for investment and lower interest rates 

table of contents gain on the sale of securities was  in as a result of the sale of labone common stock we received as part of an intercept distribution agreement with labone  entered into in there were no such sales in results of operations compared to total revenues increased to approximately million in from approximately million in excluding revenues of approximately million in from the serum western blot confirmatory test  which was discontinued in january  total revenues would have increased approximately

dollars percentage change inc dec 
percentage of total revenues market revenues insurance risk assessment infectious disease testing substance abuse testing physicians office therapies licensing and product development total revenues sales to the insurance risk assessment market declined by to approximately million in from approximately million in  as a result of the discontinuation of our serum western blot confirmatory test  improved efficiencies by end users in the use of orasure collection devices and by insurance testing laboratories in the use of immunoassay tests  inventory consolidations which resulted from the merger of our two largest insurance laboratory customers  labone and osborne group  and lower sales of urine assays 
partially offsetting this decline was an increase in sales of oral fluid assays resulting from increased penetration of the insurance risk assessment market 
sales to the infectious disease testing market increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  as a result of continued penetration of the orasure laboratory based hiv test and shipments of the oraquick rapid hiv antibody test into sub saharan africa 
sales to the substance abuse testing market increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  as a result of the substantial market penetration of the intercept drug testing service into the workplace and criminal justice markets and increased forensic toxicology sales 
of the million in substance abuse testing revenues  approximately million resulted from the sale of equipment manufactured by third party vendors 
sales to the physicians office therapies market  which consisted solely of the histofreezer wart removal system  declined to approximately million in from approximately million in  as a result of inventory consolidation by distributors in the united states and lower international sales 
despite this small decline in revenues  histofreezer sales in the united states improved steadily throughout on a quarter to quarter basis 
as a percentage of total revenues  international revenues increased to approximately in from approximately in  with histofreezer accounting for approximately of international revenues 
labone  our largest customer  and osborne group  which was acquired by labone in  together accounted for approximately and of total revenues in and  respectively 

table of contents licensing and product development revenues increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  reflecting a different mix of development work performed in during  licensing and product development revenues were primarily from the continued development of the uplink drugs of abuse rapid detection system under an agreement with dr ger safety  development of infectious disease applications for uplink under an agreement with meridian  and the second phase of a grant from the nih for the development of an oral fluid syphilis test 
during  licensing and product development revenues consisted primarily of income from a collaboration with labone related to the intercept drug testing service  development work with dr ger safety on the uplink drugs of abuse rapid detection system  and the first phase of the nih grant 
the first phase of the nih grant was for development of a laboratory based oral fluid syphilis test using the orasure collection device 
during  we requested and the nih approved a change for the second phase of that grant to apply to the development of a rapid test for syphilis using the oraquick platform 
during the first quarter of  we reassessed this project and the potential marketability of the resulting product  and elected to terminate development of the syphilis test 
as a result  we will not receive further funding under this nih grant 
our gross margin increased to approximately in from in this increase was primarily the result of lower material costs and productivity gains  negotiated contract savings  cost savings as a result of restructuring our manufacturing operations  and higher licensing and product development revenues  partially offset by incremental costs and manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the initial production of uplink analyzers and commencement of oraquick manufacturing 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  the gross margin was negatively affected by the recording of an inventory reserve of approximately million related to oraquick rapid hiv antibody tests manufactured for sale to our african distributor 
because of the failure by our african distributor to meet its contractually required minimum purchase commitments  we reevaluated our international distribution strategy for oraquick and terminated our agreement with this distributor in february the reserve was required because of concerns about the remaining shelf life of the inventory in relation to our ability to rapidly establish a new distribution channel to sell oraquick in africa 
during  we wrote off approximately million for expired orasure collection device inventory and million for serum western blot confirmatory test inventory that was obsolete  expired  or rendered unsaleable as a result of the discontinuation of that product 
research and development expenses declined to approximately million in from approximately million in research and development efforts in were focused upon the continued development of the uplink analyzer  test cassette and collector  the development of certain uplink drugs of abuse and infectious disease assays  dna feasibility studies  and clinical trials for the oraquick rapid hiv antibody test 
the investments in these projects were offset by reduced expenditures related to development of the oraquick device and lower personnel and consulting expenses at our oregon facility 
sales and marketing expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was primarily the result of additional costs associated with increased staffing levels and related expenses  and the expansion of our customer service functions 
general and administrative expenses remained flat at approximately million in and million in higher professional fees associated with certain partnering activities in were offset by cost savings from the elimination of duplicative overhead structures as a result of the merger of stc and epitope into the company 
merger related expenses were approximately million in these costs included fees for investment bankers  attorneys and accountants  filing fees  proxy solicitation expenses  employee severance  and integration costs 
there were no such costs in 
table of contents restructuring related expenses were  as a result of the manufacturing restructuring in the first quarter of these costs included expenses for employee severance and travel and transport resulting from relocating and consolidating manufacturing operations  and were paid by june  there were no such costs in interest expense decreased by to  in from  in as a result of loan principal repayments 
interest income decreased by to approximately million in from approximately million in as a result of lower cash and cash equivalents available for investment and lower interest rates 
gain on the sale of securities was  in as a result of the sale of labone common stock that we received as part of an intercept distribution arrangement with labone  entered into in in  we recorded a gain on the sale of securities of  as a result of the sale of andrew williamson sales company a w preferred stock we had received as part of a settlement with a w in during and  provisions for foreign income taxes were recorded 
liquidity and capital resources december  december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments working capital the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased approximately  during to approximately million at december   primarily as a result of the company s net loss for  an increase in inventories  a decrease in accounts payable  and capital expenditures 
offsetting these uses of cash were an increase in accounts receivable collections and proceeds from stock option exercises 
at december   the company s working capital was approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million in  a decrease of approximately million from the million used in operations in the million of cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from the company s net loss for the year of million and a reduction in accounts payable  offset by million in depreciation and amortization and by a significant improvement in our collection of accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities during was  we purchased approximately million of property and equipment and expended million on licenses  product supply and distribution agreements 
these expenditures were funded through net proceeds of approximately million generated from the sale of short term investments 
capital expenditures are anticipated to increase during to approximately million as a result of additional commitments we have made for the purchase and installation of manufacturing and research and development equipment for uplink and oraquick 
we also expect to purchase additional information systems equipment to support our new corporate and manufacturing facility in bethlehem  pennsylvania and to upgrade certain older equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million  reflecting the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of approximately million  offset by  of net loan principal repayments 

table of contents in september  we entered into a new million credit facility new credit facility with comerica bank  pursuant to which we refinanced substantially all of our previously outstanding mortgage and term debt and increased our equipment and working capital lines of credit 
the new credit facility is comprised of an  mortgage loan  a million term loan  a million non revolving equipment line of credit  and a million revolving working capital line of credit 
the  mortgage loan matures in september  bears interest at an annual floating rate equal to comerica s prime rate  and is repayable in fixed monthly principal and interest installments of  through september  at which time the interest rate and fixed monthly repayment amount will be reset for the remaining monthly installments 
the outstanding balance of the loan at december  was  the million term loan matures in march  bears interest at a fixed rate of and is repayable in forty two consecutive equal monthly principal payments of  plus interest

borrowings are repayable in consecutive  equal monthly principal installments  plus interest 
as of december   we had an outstanding balance of approximately  under this facility consisting of two individual loans of i  with a fixed annual interest rate of and ii  with a floating annual interest rate equal to comerica s prime rate of at december  we also had  available for future borrowings under this facility as of december  under the revolving working capital line of credit  we can borrow up to million to finance working capital and other needs 
interest on outstanding borrowings shall accrue at a rate  selected at our option  equal to comerica s prime rate less  or day libor plus  determined at the time of the initial borrowing 
borrowings are repayable by september   with interest payable monthly 
we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility at december  all borrowings under the new credit facility are collateralized by a first priority security interest in all of our assets  including present and future accounts receivable  chattel paper  contracts and contract rights  equipment and accessories  general intangibles  investments  instruments  inventories  and a mortgage on our manufacturing facility in bethlehem  pennsylvania 
borrowings under the equipment and working capital lines of credit are limited to commercially standard percentages of equipment purchases and accounts receivable  respectively 
the new credit facility contains certain covenants that set forth minimum requirements for our quick ratio  liquidity  and tangible net worth and that require that we achieve positive net income for the year ending december  and for each year thereafter 
the new credit facility also restricts our ability to pay dividends  to make certain investments  to incur additional indebtedness  to sell or otherwise dispose of a substantial portion of assets  and to merge or consolidate operations with an unaffiliated entity  without the consent of comerica 
in october  we entered into new agreements with biom rieux  inc bmx  which replaced existing agreements between the parties  for the supply by bmx of hiv antigen required to manufacture our oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory test  and for the distribution by bmx of the oral fluid western blot product on an exclusive worldwide basis 
these agreements have an initial term ending december   which may be extended until december  under certain circumstances 
as consideration for bmx entering into the new agreements  we have agreed to pay bmx  in installments through march  we have entered into a ten year facility lease with tech iii partners  llc tech partners  an entity owned and controlled by two of our executive officers see certain relationships and related transactions  included herein 
under the terms of this operating lease  we began leasing a  square foot facility in 
table of contents october at a base rent of  per year  increasing to  per year  during the initial year term 
the base rental may be increased after the fifth year of the initial term in order to reflect changes in the interest rate on debt incurred by tech partners to finance construction of the leased facilities 
we have not guaranteed any debt incurred by tech partners 
the lease also provides us with options to renew the lease for an additional five years at a rental rate of  per year  and to purchase the facility at any time during the initial ten year term based on a formula set forth in the lease 
the combination of our current cash position and available borrowings under our new credit facility is expected to be sufficient to fund our foreseeable operating and capital needs 
however  our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned due to many factors  including  but not limited to  the cost and timing of the expansion of our manufacturing capacity  the progress of our research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical testing  the magnitude of capital expenditures  changes in existing and potential relationships with business partners  the time and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents  proprietary rights and any necessary licenses  the cost and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of commercial launch of new products  market acceptance of new products  competing technological and market developments  the scope and timing of strategic acquisitions  and other factors

off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
table of contents reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our judgments and estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue recognition  restructuring costs  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in item of this report 
we consider the following accounting estimates  which have been discussed with our audit committee  to be most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
revenue recognition 
we follow us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
this bulletin draws on existing accounting rules and provides specific guidance on revenue recognition of up front non refundable licensing and development fees 
we license certain products or technology to outside third parties  in return for which we receive up front licensing fees 
some of these fees can be significant 
in accordance with sab  we recognize this revenue ratably over the related license period 
we also enter into research and development contracts with corporate  government and or private entities 
these contracts generally provide for payments to us upon achievement of certain research or development milestones 
product development revenues from these contracts are recognized only if the specified milestone is achieved and accepted by the customer and payment from the customer is probable 
any amounts received prior to the performance of product development efforts are recorded as deferred revenues 
recognition of revenue under these contracts can be sporadic  as it is the result of achieving specific research and development milestones 
furthermore  revenue from future milestone payments will not be recognized if the underlying research and development milestone is not achieved 
we recognize product revenues when products are shipped 
we do not grant price protection or product return rights to our customers  except for warranty returns 
where a product fails to comply with its limited warranty  we can either replace the product or provide the customer with a refund of the purchase price or credit against future purchases 
historically  returns arising from warranty issues have been infrequent and immaterial 
accordingly  we expense warranty returns as incurred 
while such returns have been immaterial in the past  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same rate of warranty claims as we have in the past 
any significant increase in product warranty claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which the claims occur 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are reduced by an estimated allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
on an ongoing basis  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon the customer s payment history and creditworthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we also continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that are identified  we use our judgment to establish and evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for estimated credit losses  which was  at december  while credit losses have been within our expectations and the allowance provided  these losses can vary from period to period   and  in  and  respectively 
furthermore  there is no assurance that we will experience credit losses at the same rates as we have in the past 
also  at december   approximately million or of our accounts receivable were due from one major customer 
any significant changes in the liquidity or financial position of this customer  or others  could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and future operating results 

table of contents inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined on a first in  first out basis  and include the cost of raw materials  labor and overhead 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we continually evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when  in the opinion of management  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  either a reserve is established against the inventories carrying value or the inventories are completely written off 
we base these decisions on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements over the next twelve months and the expiration dates of raw materials and finished goods 
during  and  we wrote off inventory which had a cost of approximately million  million and million  respectively  as a result of increased scrap levels and product expiration issues 
forecasting product demand can be a complex process  especially for a new product such as our oraquick rapid hiv antibody test  which was launched in the united states in november although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the carrying value of our inventories and reported operating results 
long lived and intangible assets 
our long lived assets are comprised of property and equipment and an investment in a nonaffiliated entity  and our intangible assets primarily consist of patents and product rights 
together  these assets have a net book value of approximately million or of our total assets at december  our investment in a privately held nonaffiliated company is recorded under the cost method of accounting  because we do not have a controlling interest in this company nor do we have the ability to exert significant influence over the operating and financial policies of this investee company 
property and equipment  patents and product rights are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which we determine based upon our estimate of the period of time over which each asset will generate revenues 
an impairment of long lived or intangible assets could occur whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger an asset impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of an asset or in our strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  shortening of product life cycles or changes in technology  and negative financial performance of our nonaffiliated investee company 
if we believe impairment of an asset has occurred  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the net book value of the affected assets to the fair value of these assets  which is generally determined based upon the present value of the expected cash flows associated with the use of these assets 
if the net book value exceeds the fair value of the impaired assets  we would incur an impairment expense equal to this difference 
we currently believe the future cash flows to be received from our long lived and intangible assets will exceed their book value and  as such  we have not recognized any impairment losses through december  any unanticipated significant impairment in the future  however  could have a material adverse impact to our balance sheet and future operating results 
deferred tax assets 
we have a history of losses  which has generated a sizeable federal tax net operating loss nol carryforward of approximately million as of december  the deferred tax asset associated with these nols and other temporary differences is approximately million at december  under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of taxable income in the future 
due to the size of the nol carryforward in relation to our history of unprofitable operations  we have not recognized any of our net deferred tax asset 
it is possible that we could be profitable in the future at levels which would cause us to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the deferred tax asset 
upon reaching such a conclusion  we would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then begin to provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which we believe would approximate 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into various contractual relationships with strategic corporate partners  customers  distributors  research laboratories and universities  licensors  
table of contents licensees  suppliers  vendors and other parties 
as such  we could be subject to litigation  claims or assessments arising from any or all of these relationships 
we account for contingencies such as these in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
sfas requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires that we use our best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
certain relationships and related transactions we have entered into a commercial lease the lease with tech iii partners  llc tech partners  which provided for the construction of a  square foot facility on land adjacent to our bethlehem  pennsylvania headquarters  and the lease of that facility to us 
tech partners is owned and controlled by michael j 
gausling  the company s president and chief executive officer  and dr 
r 
sam niedbala  the company s executive vice president and chief science officer 
the facility will house manufacturing  research and development  and administrative operations required to support the expected growth of our business 
construction of the facility was completed in october the lease  as amended  has an initial ten year term ending in october and a base rent starting at  and increasing to  per year over that term 
the base rental rate may be increased after the fifth year of the initial term in order to reflect changes in the interest rate on debt incurred by tech partners to finance construction of the leased facilities 
we have not guaranteed any debt incurred by tech partners 
the lease also provides us with options to renew the lease for an additional five years at a rental rate of  per year  and to purchase the facility at any time during the initial ten year term based on a formula set forth in the lease 
prior to deciding to enter into the lease and an amendment increasing the base rental to reflect the cost of certain tenant fit out improvements  our board of directors retained imperial realty appraisal llc  an independent commercial real estate appraisal firm  to evaluate the proposed base rental rate 
imperial realty issued opinions indicating that the annual base rent set forth in the lease  as amended  is below the market rental rate we could otherwise expect to pay to lease a comparable commercial property in the same general geographic market 
the terms of the lease are otherwise substantially similar to a commercial lease we entered into with a third party for our existing bethlehem  pennsylvania headquarters 
in january  we terminated the employment agreement with robert d 
thompson  our former chief executive officer  and mr 
thompson entered into a severance agreement pursuant to which mr 
thompson will receive approximately  we also held a  note receivable previously made to mr 
thompson in connection with his relocation from portland  oregon  which was repaid during recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which was released in august  addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and their associated asset retirement costs 
sfas requires an enterprise to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of intangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  or normal use of the asset
