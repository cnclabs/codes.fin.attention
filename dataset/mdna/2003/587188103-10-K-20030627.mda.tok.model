item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which are included in this report  and the risk factors information in the business section of this report 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue  net of discounts  returns  and rebates in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when the right of return exists  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
as required by these standards  revenue is recorded when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the buyer s price is fixed or determinable  contractual obligations have been satisfied  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these requirements are met  and sales and related cost of sales are recognized primarily upon the shipment of products  or in the case of consignment inventories  upon the notification of usage by the customer 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and other volume based incentives 
should the actual level of customer participation in these programs differ from those estimated  additional adjustments to revenue are recorded 
we also allow credit for products returned within our policy terms 
we record an allowance for estimated returns at the time of sale based on historical experience  recent gross sales levels and any notification of pending returns 
should the actual returns differ from those estimated  additional adjustments to revenue and cost of sales may be required 
accounts receivable we market our products to a diverse customer base  principally throughout the united states  canada and western europe 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers  primarily hospitals  doctors and distributors 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined through review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based on historical experience and any specifically identified customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of our customers  or the economy as whole  were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of our customers ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
these adjustments would be included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of cost  based on the first in first out fifo cost method  or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions differ from those projected by us  additional inventory valuation adjustments may be required 
these valuation adjustments would be included in cost of goods sold 
warranties and related reserves we provide an accrual for the estimated cost of product warranties and product liability claims at the time revenue is recognized 
such accruals are based on estimates  which are based on relevant factors such as historical experience  the warranty period  estimated costs  levels of insurance and insurance retentions  identified product quality issues  if any  and  to a limited extent  information developed by the insurance company using actuarial techniques 
these accruals are analyzed periodically for adequacy 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  the warranty obligation is affected by reported rates of product problems and costs incurred in correcting product problems 
should actual reported problem rates or the resulting costs differ from our estimates  adjustments to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
these adjustments would be included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we adopted sfas no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective april  and analyzed goodwill and intangibles for impairment and no impairment was noted as a result of this analysis 
if these assumptions and their related estimates change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
these impairment charges would be included in the results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth various items from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended march  net sales costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general  and administrative research and development restructuring charge operating income from continuing operations interest expense interest income other income  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income years ended march  and sales sales for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase of 
included in fiscal sales are eleven months of clinical and consumer healthcare product sales relating to our may acquisition of the urology and ostomy business of portex ltd 
sales of products acquired in the portex transaction accounted for five percentage points of the year to year growth 
the increase in sales was in both domestic and international markets 
foreign exchange rate movements  primarily the stronger euro  had a favorable year to year impact on international sales of million  or approximately four percentage points of the year to year growth 
sales of aesthetic and general surgery products increased to million from million in the prior year 
total sales of breast implants products increased to million from million in the prior year 
sales of body contouring products increased million or over the prior year 
we believe that sales growth was primarily attributable to strong product demand both domestically and internationally  the introduction of an improved tissue expander in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a resurgence of demand including surgeries that were postponed after the events of september th and the benefit from the effect of the strong euro 
sales of aesthetic and general surgery are expected to increase at a slower rate in fiscal sales of surgical urology products increased to million from million in the prior year 
the growth primarily resulted from strong sales of products acquired in our february acquisition of porges sa  included new product sales and the effect of a stronger euro 
penile implant sales increased million  due in part to incremental sales from the titan inflatable device introduced in the third quarter of fiscal and marketing program efforts to increase consumer awareness 
sales of pelvic floor reconstruction products increased million due to new product introductions late in fiscal brachytherapy sales decreased million  or from the prior year as unit sales increases were partially offset as competitive pressures decreased average selling prices 
in addition  interruption of our supply of palladium radioactive seeds due to the expiration of our exclusive distribution agreement with nasi and difficulties in securing new vendor supply to fulfill customer orders resulted in lost sales  and these difficulties have continued into fiscal sales of clinical and consumer healthcare products increased to million from million in the prior year 
this growth primarily resulted from our may acquisition of the urology and ostomy businesses of portex ltd  whose product sales are included for eleven months of fiscal and accounted for approximately million of the sales growth over fiscal sales growth was generally aided by the effect of the stronger euro as nearly half of these product sales are invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar 
in addition  sales of male external catheters grew  primarily in international markets  offsetting a slight decline in sales of other healthcare products 
sales of intermittent self catheters increased following the introduction of the self cath plus lubricious catheter in fiscal cost of sales cost of sales was of net sales for fiscal  compared to in fiscal cost of sales for the aesthetic and general surgery products decreased from of net sales to  primarily due to efficiencies of scale and improved manufacturing efficiencies at our texas facility partially offset by startup costs at our new manufacturing facility in the netherlands 
cost of sales for surgical urology products decreased from of net sales to primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and the recent acquisition of mills biopharmaceutical to manufacture our own iodine brachytherapy seeds 
cost of sales for clinical and consumer healthcare products increased from of net sales to primarily due to the may acquisition of the urology and ostomy businesses of portex whose products have lower margins than our previously existing products 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of net sales reflects efficiencies of scale as selling  general and administrative costs grew at rates slower than overall revenue growth 
these economies of scale were offset slightly by the non recurring general and administrative expenses associated with the recent acquisition of the urology and ostomy business of portex and non capitalizable expenses related to the implementation of information technology systems to modernize and integrate recent acquisitions 
research and development research and development expenses were of net sales in fiscal  a slight decrease from in fiscal overall spending on research and development increased by from the prior year 
the decrease in research and development as a percentage of net sales is partially attributable to several recent acquisitions  and associated revenue growth  in the clinical and consumer healthcare segment 
this segment has a generally lower level of research and development spending on new product development than the long term implantable products in the aesthetics and surgical urology segments 
fiscal development costs relate primarily to our clinical studies and accelerated product enhancement projects for existing products and new product development 
although we have successfully completed several pre market approval application submissions related to mammary and penile implants in recent years  the amount of spending on research and development is not expected to decrease as the focus of our research and development efforts shifts towards product enhancements and new product development 
in addition  we are committed to several post fda approval follow up studies  and a variety of clinical and laboratory studies in connection with our gel filled and saline filled mammary implants and other products 
interest and other income and expense interest expense increased to million in fiscal  from thousand in fiscal in january  we acquired the assets of south bay medical llc 
approximately million of the purchase price was recorded as a long term accrued liability at net present value 
in december  we recorded an additional million of long term accrued liability at net present value related to the acquisition of certain intangible rights from prosurg  inc imputed interest on these liabilities is charged to interest expense 
this imputed interest and balances outstanding on several lines of credit established to facilitate operating cash flow needs at our foreign subsidiaries  slightly offset by lower prevailing borrowing rates of interest  accounted for the increase in interest expense over the prior year 
interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is due to higher cash and marketable security balances partially offset by lower prevailing interest rates on short term investments and a change in our investment strategy 
our new investment strategy involves a shift to taxable money market investments which have a higher pretax yield  from tax free municipal bonds and similar tax advantaged investment vehicles  which have a lower pre tax yield 
other income  net primarily includes gains or losses on sales of marketable securities  disposal of assets  foreign currency gains or losses related to our foreign operations and impairment charges on long term investments 
both years include income from the sale of marketable securities  net foreign exchange transaction and remeasurement gains and loss  offset by impairment charges on long term investments 
in fiscal  we recorded a million permanent impairment of our equity investment in intracel corporation 
during fiscal  we recorded an additional million to completely write off our investment in intracel corporation upon its bankruptcy filing 
during the fiscal  we sold our remaining investment in north american scientific  inc and recorded a pre tax gain of  we determined the investment in paradigm medical industries inc paradigm  was impaired and recorded a one time pre tax impairment charge of  other income  net for fiscal  also includes a one time gain of  related to the settlement of a dispute with paradigm  a one time foreign exchange gain of  on the repayment of our million euro loan to partially fund the acquisition of porges sa and the realized gains on the disposition of long term marketable securities available for sale of million 
income taxes the effective rate of corporate income taxes was for both fiscal and fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate from historical levels is a result of a higher proportion of income from foreign operations with lower tax rates and tax refunds received in the first and second quarters of fiscal year related to the amendment of tax returns for our foreign sales corporation 
as a result these tax refunds  the tax rate for the first half of fiscal was whereas the tax rate in the second half of fiscal was 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  compared to million for the previous year  an increase of million or 
increased sales  primarily of aesthetics products  lower cost of goods sold and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  and a tax refund increased net income  while the write down of our investment in paradigm reduced net income 
years ended march  and sales sales for fiscal increased to million from million in  an increase of 
included in fiscal sales are months of surgical urology and clinical and consumer healthcare product sales relating to our february acquisition of porges sa  compared to two months of sales included in fiscal porges product sales accounted for percentage points of the year to year growth 
sales were negatively affected by the continued strength of the us dollar versus other currencies and the general economic slowdown in the economy 
foreign exchange rate movements had an unfavorable year to year impact on international sales of million  or less than of consolidated sales 
sales of aesthetic and general surgery products increased to million from million in the prior year 
we believe that the modest growth in aesthetic product sales was primarily the result of the general economic slowdown in fiscal  and the events of september  the sales of aesthetic products used in cosmetic surgeries were substantially even with prior year sales  as these product sales are affected more than our other aesthetic products and segments by general economic conditions  as a higher proportion of these cosmetic surgeries are paid directly by the patient 
however  the sales of aesthetic products used in reconstructive surgeries increased over prior year sales  as a high proportion of these product sales are reimbursed by third party payers 
sales of surgical urology products increased to million from million in the prior year 
this growth primarily resulted from our february acquisition of porges sa  whose product sales are included in fiscal sales for the whole year 
porges product sales accounted for percentage points of the year to year growth 
penile implant sales included incremental sales of the alpha inflatable device with the new lockout valve introduced late in fiscal brachytherapy sales increased slightly over the prior year as unit sales increases were partially offset as competitive pressures decreased average selling prices 
sales of clinical and consumer healthcare products increased to million from million in the prior year 
this growth primarily resulted from our february acquisition of porges sa  whose product sales are included for all of fiscal porges product sales accounted for percentage points of the year to year growth 
in addition  sales of intermittent self catheters grew with the introduction of the self cath plus lubricious catheter in fiscal  while there was a slight decline in male external catheter sales of 
cost of sales cost of sales was of net sales for fiscal  compared to in fiscal fiscal included porges product sales for the entire year as opposed to two months in fiscal year porges products have an average cost of sales of approximately as compared to a historic average of for the rest of our products and  consequently  the additional porges product sales have diluted the gross margin product mix 
this dilution was partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies in our aesthetic and clinical and consumer healthcare products 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales in fiscal compared to  exclusive of the restructuring charge  in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of net sales reflects cost savings from our restructuring of corporate staff during the second and third quarters of fiscal and the acquisition of porges which has a lower percentage of selling  general and administrative expenses to net sales than the rest of the company 
research and development research and development expenses were of net sales in fiscal  a slight decrease from in fiscal overall spending on research and development increased by from the prior year 
fiscal development costs relate primarily to our automated brachytherapy workstation  accelerated product enhancement projects for existing products and new product development 
fiscal also includes research and development costs related to porges products  for which research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales have historically been lower than those for our other products 
although we have successfully completed several pre market approval application submissions related to mammary and penile implants in recent years  the amount of spending on research and development is not expected to decrease as the focus of our research and development efforts shifts towards product enhancements and new product development 
in addition  we are committed to a variety of clinical and laboratory studies in connection with our gel filled and saline filled mammary implants and other products 
interest and other income and expense interest expense increased to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal in january  we acquired the assets of south bay medical llc 
approximately million of the purchase price was recorded as a long term accrued liability at net present value 
in december  we recorded an additional million of long term accrued liability at net present value related to the acquisition of certain intangible rights from prosurg  inc imputed interest on these liabilities is charged to interest expense 
this imputed interest and balances outstanding on several lines of credit established to facilitate operating cash flow needs at our foreign subsidiaries accounted for the increase in interest expense over the prior year 
in fiscal   of interest incurred on a line of credit to finance the construction of a new foreign manufacturing facility was capitalized 
interest income decreased from million in to million in fiscal the decrease is due to lower cash and marketable security balances  lower prevailing interest rates on short term investments  and a shift in our investment strategy from taxable commercial paper which has a higher pretax yield to tax free municipal bonds and similar tax advantaged investment vehicles  which currently have a higher after tax yield 
other income  net primarily includes gains or losses on sales of marketable securities  disposal of assets  and foreign currency gains or losses related to our foreign operations 
in fiscal  we recorded a million permanent impairment of our equity investment in intracel corporation 
this impairment charge was offset by realized gains on the disposition of marketable securities recorded as long term marketable securities available for sale 
during fiscal  we recorded an additional million write down of our investment in intracel corporation upon its bankruptcy filing 
at march  the investment in intracel corporation is carried at no value 
other income  net for fiscal  also includes a one time gain of  related to the settlement of a dispute with paradigm medical industries  a one time foreign exchange gain of  on the repayment of the million euro loan to partially fund the acquisition of porges sa and the realized gains on the disposition of long term marketable securities available for sale of million 
income taxes the effective rate of corporate income taxes was for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal is a result of a higher proportion of income from foreign operations with lower tax rates  increased tax exempt interest income  tax credits related to research and development  and a refund received in the fourth quarter of fiscal year related to the amendment of prior year tax returns for our foreign sales corporation

increased sales  primarily from our porges sa acquisition in february  lower cost of goods sold and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  and a tax refund increased net income  while the write down of our investment in intracel corporation and lower investment income reduced net income 
inflation we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our operations over the three year period ended march  liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million and million at march  and  respectively 
during the three years ended march   liquidity needs have been satisfied principally by cash flow from operations and  to a lesser extent from borrowings under our line of credit 
despite significant acquisition and stock repurchase activities  we maintained our strong cash and financial position throughout fiscal at march   working capital was million compared to million the previous year 
we generated million of cash from continuing operations during fiscal  compared to million the previous year 
increased income from continuing operations  and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities contributed to the increased cash flow 
these amounts were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory 
during fiscal  we invested million in manufacturing equipment  information technology systems  and in a building at our manufacturing facility in oklahoma 
we anticipate investing approximately million in fiscal to complete facility improvements  purchase production equipment and continue the implementation of information technology systems 
we received cash from the exercise of employee stock options 
employee stock option exercises provided million and million of cash in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon  among other factors  fluctuations in the market value of our common stock relative to the exercise price of such options 
our board of directors has authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program 
the objectives of the program  among other items  are to offset the dilutive effect of our employee stock option program  provide liquidity to the market and to reduce the overall number of shares outstanding 
repurchases are subject to market conditions and cash availability 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares for consideration of million 
we intend to continue the share repurchase program in fiscal and million shares remain authorized for repurchase 
certain technologies related to the manufacture of mammary prostheses were developed under a agreement with a limited partnership whereby the limited partners contributed funds towards the development of the technology in exchange for payments based upon a percentage of future sales of the products utilizing the technology 
we paid approximately million in such payments in fiscal to the partnership 
we were the general partner for this partnership 
the agreement included an option to purchase the technology and thereby terminate the partnership 
in fiscal  we exercised our option to make a lump sum payment to the limited partners in lieu of all future payments and rights according to the agreement of purchase and sale between us and the partnership  as amended 
the limited partners could elect to be paid in cash  our common stock  or a combination 
this transaction was completed in the second quarter ended september  the limited partners elected to be paid million in cash and   post split shares of our common stock 
the stock  transfer of which is restricted by rule  was valued at its fair market value on the date of issuance  of approximately million 
the decrease in payments to the partners is offset by the increased amortization of the new intangible asset and the additional common shares outstanding  thus having a neutral effect on earnings per share 
in january  we completed the acquisition of south bay medical  a development stage company focused on the development of a new technology for a computer based workstation and automated cartridge based needle loading system for use in brachytherapy procedures 
the total consideration included million in cash   restricted shares of our common stock having a fair market value of million  and million to be paid in cash or our common stock over the next several years 
these future payments have been recorded as an acquisition obligation liability at net present value million at march   and will continue to increase as imputed interest is recorded 
approximately million of the acquisition obligation liability is to be paid in shares of our common stock valued at fair market value on the date of issuance 
in february  we acquired porges sa  a subsidiary of sanofi synthelabo headquartered in paris  and with manufacturing facilities in sarlat  france 
the consideration paid for porges sa was million 
in december  we entered into several agreements with prosurg  inc to purchase certain patent rights and a supply of a bio absorbable co polymer product 
the total consideration included million in cash and million in short and long term payments due over the next several years 
the future payments have been recorded as an acquisition obligation liability at net present value and will increase with imputed interest to million due over the next several years 
on may   we announced that we had completed the acquisition of the urology business of portex ltd  a subsidiary of smiths group plc 
the consideration paid for portex was million in cash 
in january  we completed the acquisition of mills biopharmaceuticals  inc  a manufacturer of iodine brachytherapy seeds for the treatment of prostate cancer 
the consideration was million in cash 
we have a secured line of credit for borrowings up to million credit agreement  which accrue interest at the prevailing prime rate or at a mark up over libor at our discretion 
the credit agreement includes certain covenants that  among other things  limit the dividends we may pay and requires maintenance of certain levels of tangible net worth and debt service ratios 
during fiscal  we used the credit agreement to guarantee the secured loan of a vendor  in the amount of million  and to facilitate the ramp up of production capacity related to a new product 
this loan was repaid in and the guarantee expired 
in addition  two commercial letters of credit totaling million are outstanding at march  accordingly  although there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at march   only million was available for additional borrowings 
in addition  in february  we established several lines of credit with local foreign lenders to facilitate operating cash flow needs at our foreign subsidiaries 
these lines are at market rates of interest  unsecured  guaranteed by mentor corporation  and total million  of which million was outstanding  and million was available at march  in fiscal  a line of credit of million was established to finance the construction of a new facility in leiden  the netherlands 
the borrowings accrue interest at euribor plus and are secured by the new facility and other assets in the netherlands 
at march   million was outstanding and million was available under this line 
the line of credit provides for conversion to a term loan at prevailing interest rates when construction of the new facility is completed 
at march   our total short term borrowings under all lines of credit was million and the weighted average interest rate was 
the total amount of additional borrowings available to us under all lines of credit was million and million at march  and  respectively 
at march   million was outstanding under these lines of credit at a weighted average borrowing rate of 
we have historically paid a quarterly cash dividend of 
per share 
in december  our board of directors authorized a for stock split and increased the quarterly dividend on a post split basis from 
per share to 
per share 
at the new annual rate of 
per share  the aggregate annual dividend would equal approximately million 
it is our intent to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future subject to among other things  board approval  cash availability and alternative cash needs 
the credit agreement limits the aggregate amount of dividends payable in any year to one half of the net income of the preceding year 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash and other commercial commitments at march  in thousands less than after contractual cash obligations total year years years years operating leases total contractual cash obligations      commercial commitments lines of credit other commercial commitments total commercial commitments in addition  in the ordinary course of business  we have at any one time  outstanding purchase orders for raw materials and other supplies  which may in aggregate be significant but for which usage does not exceed one year 
our principal source of liquidity at march  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  plus million available under our existing lines of credit 
we believe that funds generated from operations  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds available under our line of credit agreements will be adequate to meet our working capital needs and capital expenditure investment requirements and commitments for the foreseeable future 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our unforeseen requirements or to consummate acquisitions of other business  products or technologies 
additional funds could be raised by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on terms that would be favorable to us  or at all 
if funds are raised by issuing additional equity securities or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentage of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities issued by us may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
forward looking statements certain words in this report like believe  intend  anticipate  expect  estimate  seek  and similar expressions are intended to identify  in certain cases  forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the predicted results 
such factors which may affect forward looking statements include  among others  the following significant product liability  warranty claims  or other claims  errors in estimates  assumptions and judgments used in accounting  non compliance with fda and other regulatory agencies  inadequate reimbursement by government agencies and others for our products  difficulties implementing and integrating new information technologies systems  and other factors outlined in our previously filed public documents  copies of which may be obtained without cost from us 
given these uncertainties  investors are cautioned not to place too much weight on such statements 
we are not obligated to update these forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risks involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we generally do not use derivative instruments 
we maintain a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents  with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase 
we also have current marketable securities  consisting primarily of money market mutual funds  us state and municipal bonds  and commercial paper that are of limited credit risk and have contractual maturities of less than two years 
given the short term nature of these investments  we are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
a portion of our operations consist of sales activities in foreign markets 
we manufacture our products primarily in the united states and europe and sell them outside the us through a combination of international distributors and wholly owned sales offices 
sales to third party distributors and to the wholly owned sales offices are transacted in us dollars or in euros 
our sales offices invoice customers in their local currency 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in those foreign markets 
the principal exposure on sales to third party distributors stems from the potential for weak economic conditions in the foreign market  thus weakening the foreign currency  decreasing the customer s buying power and potentially decreasing our sales 
our exposure on sales to our subsidiaries consists of the exposure related to a weakening local currency when payment of the related payables are made resulting in more local currency to pay off the us denominated payable than when it was originally recorded  thus lowering the subsidiaries earnings  and the exposure that upon translation of the subsidiaries monthly financial statements  a weakening local currency would cause sales made in local currency to be recorded in a lower amount of us dollars than if the currency had been stable as compared to the us dollar 
however  in the latter instance  operating expenses would also be translated at lower amounts and  accordingly  the effect on net income would be mitigated 
we do not currently hedge any of these exposures
