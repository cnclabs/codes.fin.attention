item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview on march   actionpoint  inc entered into a merger agreement with captiva software corporation or old captiva 
the merger was completed on july  in the merger  old captiva became a wholly owned subsidiary of actionpoint and actionpoint changed its name to captiva software corporation 
as a result of the purchase accounting that applies to the merger of actionpoint and old captiva  the results of operations of old captiva are included in our results of operations for the year ended december  only from august  therefore  we expect to report increased revenues and increased costs in future periods as the operations of old captiva will be included for an entire reporting period 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment or complex estimation processes 
we believe that the following accounting policies fit this definition revenue recognition revenue is generated primarily from two sources i software licenses  which includes software license and royalty revenue  and ii services and other  which includes software license maintenance fees  training and professional services revenue and sales of third party products  primarily digital scanners 
license revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collection is determined to be probable and no significant undelivered obligations remain 
royalty revenue is recognized when partners ship or pre purchase rights to ship products incorporating our software  provided collection of such revenue is determined to be probable and we have no further obligations 
services and support revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the maintenance contract or as the services are provided 
payments for maintenance fees are generally made in advance and are non refundable 
third party hardware sales revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable and  iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
for arrangements with multiple elements eg delivered and undelivered products  maintenance and other services  we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us  using the residual value method 
the fair values for ongoing maintenance and support obligations are based upon separate sales of renewals to customers or upon substantive renewal rates quoted in the agreements 
the fair values for services  such as training or consulting  are based upon sales prices of these services when sold separately to other customers 
when software licenses are sold without services  revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met 
deferred revenue is primarily comprised of undelivered maintenance services 
when software licenses are sold with professional services and such services are deemed essential to the functionality of the overall solution  combined software license and service revenue is recognized over the service period 
when software licenses are sold with professional services and such services are not considered essential to the functionality of the software  software license revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met and service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested at least annually for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  ranging from less than one year to five years 
the determination of the fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
determining the fair values and useful lives of 
table of contents intangible assets especially requires the exercise of judgment 
to assist us in this process  we used an independent valuation firm 
while there are a number of different generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired  we primarily used the discounted cash flow method 
this method requires significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis 
in addition  other significant estimates are required such as residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business  based on available historical information and industry averages 
the judgments made in determining the estimated useful lives assigned to each class of assets acquired can also significantly affect our net operating results 
in addition  the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  is subject to future impairments if we experience declines in operating results or negative industry or economic trends or if our future performance is below our projections and estimates 
valuation of goodwill we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is reviewed at least annually 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment  include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and decreased market capitalization relative to net book value 
when there is indication that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas 
this statement supercedes emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
fas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
fas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we recently initiated certain exit activities and are accounting for those activities under eitf accordingly  adoption of fas will not have a material impact on our results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas to provide alternative methods of voluntarily transitioning to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
fas also amends the disclosure requirements of fas to require disclosure of the method used to account for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method on reported results in both annual and interim financial statements 
the quarterly disclosure provisions will be effective for us beginning with the quarter ending march  we will continue to utilize the intrinsic value method and accordingly  adoption of fas has no impact on our results of operations 

table of contents in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others the interpretation 
the interpretation requires companies to recognize  at inception of the guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee and also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures  even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote 
the interpretation provides specific guidance identifying the characteristics of contracts that are subject to its guidance in its entirety from those only subject to the initial recognition and measurement provisions 
the recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of the interpretation are effective for interim and annual period financial statements ending after december  although we have issued guarantees and will likely continue to issue guarantees that we believe are within the scope of the interpretation  the fair value associated with such guarantees is not expected to be material 
accordingly  adoption of the interpretation is not currently expected to have a material impact on our results of operations

merger costs details of the merger costs are as follows in thousands cash non cash estimated cost completed activity reserve balance at december  impairment of assets non cash excess lease costs cash reduction in workforce cash during the year ended december   as the result of a review of the combined operation  we adopted a plan which included a reduction of our workforce and office space made redundant by the merger 
implementation of this plan is expected to largely be completed during as a result of the adoption of this plan  we recorded charges of million during the year ended december  these charges primarily relate to the consolidation of the company s continuing operations resulting in the impairment of an asset  excess lease costs and a reduction in workforce  resulting in costs incurred for employee severance

also as part of this plan  we elected to consolidate our operations and attempt to sublease certain of our facilities which housed portions of our operations  marketing  sales and administrative activities 
during the year ended december   we recorded estimated excess lease costs of million which were recorded as merger costs 
estimated excess lease costs are based on assumptions of differences between lease payments and 
table of contents sublease receipts that could be realized on a potential sublease and assumed carrying terms 
in january  we entered into an agreement to sublease the excess facility space 
the sublease commenced in february and expires in february future expected receipts under the sublease are million and  for the years ending december  and  respectively 
these expected receipts are in excess of the estimated receipts used to estimate the merger costs recorded during the year ended december   however  due to the uncertainty of collectibility of these amounts  the estimated merger costs will be reduced as the sublease receipts are collected or reasonably expected to be collected

in addition  as a result of the merger  our ability to utilize its historical net operating losses and tax credits as well as the historical net operating losses and tax credits of the old captiva business may have become limited and therefore it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of those deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the income tax provision of million recorded during the year ended december  is comprised of the following tax on the gain from the sale of our dialog server product of million  the change in valuation allowance of approximately million to reduce net deferred tax assets based on management s assessment of the uncertainty of the realizability of such assets  and a provision for foreign taxes of approximately million offset by the utilization of net operating losses of million

for the year ended december   we incurred negative cash flows from operations of million 
we may incur additional operating losses and negative cash flows in the future 
failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise additional capital or reduce spending could adversely affect our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
we currently have no plans to fund our business with cash from sources other than operations and its existing cash and cash equivalents 
a substantial portion of our annual revenues are realized during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 
we believe that this is caused by its customers spending and budget patterns 
this seasonality causes variability in our working capital needs during the year  however  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under our line of credit are sufficient to manage this variability 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  in connection with the merger  we assumed a line of credit with a bank 
on the merger date  july  and on december   the outstanding principal balance was million 
borrowings under the line of credit are limited to the greater of million or of eligible accounts receivable 
outstanding balances under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
all of our assets collateralize the credit facility 
the line of credit expires in august pursuant to the terms of the line of credit  we are restricted from paying dividends on our common stock 
we expect to renew the line of credit prior to its expiration  however  there is no assurance that we will be able to do so under comparable terms or at all 
net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in the net cash used in operating activities in was largely due to the payment of merger costs  increased accounts receivable and deferred revenue and net changes to other components of working capital 
the net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to a reduction in operating expenses together with favorable net changes in working capital 
as of december   we believe that cash payments of certain professional fees and related transaction costs associated with the recently completed merger and costs related to integration activities are substantially complete 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  including direct costs of the merger and purchases of property and equipment  partially off set by proceeds from the dialog server escrow account and cash received in the merger 
this compares to net cash provided by investing activities of million in 
table of contents which included proceeds from net sales of marketable investments and the sale of the dialog server product line that were partially off set by purchases of property and equipment 
we do not anticipate that there will be substantial cash used or generated from investing activities for the short term 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for and million for  primarily from purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and from the proceeds from exercises of employee stock options 
we expect that cash provided from financing activities  primarily semi annual sales of stock under the employee stock purchase plan  will be comparable to that of recent periods in the short term 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand  as well as expected cash flows from operations and the line of credit 
although transaction and integration expenses associated with the recently completed merger have reduced cash  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for at least the next months 
we may  however  seek additional equity or debt financing to fund further expansion 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or that it  if available  will be obtainable on terms favorable to us and would not be dilutive 
we have entered into various operating leases for our facilities and sales offices  which as of december  expired at various dates through we have entered into capital leases for certain of our property and equipment which expire in future minimum lease commitments at december  due under these non cancelable operating and capital leases are as follows in thousands operating leases capital leases year ending december  total minimum lease payments less amount representing interest total present value of minimum payments less current portion non current portion in january  we extended the term of a facility lease to january at a reduced rental rate

these foreign currencies are primarily british pounds  euros and the australian dollar 
additionally  substantially all of the receivables and payables of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio and its line of credit
