the company s hotel brands include westcoast and red lion

page critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to valuation of long lived assets  assets held for sale  intangible assets  other assets  self insurance reserves  collectibility of accounts receivable  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from estimates and assumptions 
property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the company also has investments in partnerships that own and operate hotel properties 
the assessment of long lived assets for possible impairment requires the company to make judgments  regarding real estate values  estimated future cash flow from the respective properties and other matters 
the company reviews the recoverability of its long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
for the year ended december   the company recognized an impairment loss of approximately thousand with respect to a partnership investment 
the company accounts for assets held for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas 
the company s assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their historical carrying value cost less accumulated depreciation or market value 
depreciation is terminated when the asset is determined to be held for sale 
if the assets are ultimately not sold within the guidelines of sfas  depreciation is reinstated for the period they were held for sale 
the company believes that its assets held for sale will be completed in  unless circumstances arise that were previously considered unlikely 
the company s intangible assets include brands and goodwill 
the company accounts for its brands and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas 
the company expects to receive future benefits from previously acquired brands and goodwill over an indefinite period of time and therefore  effective january   no longer amortizes its brands and goodwill in accordance with sfas the annual impairment review requires the company to make certain judgments  including estimates of future cash flow with respect to brands and estimates of the company s fair value and its components with respect to goodwill 
the company completed its impairment review of brands  goodwill and other intangible assets which did not result in an impairment loss during the company s other intangible assets include management  marketing and lease contracts 
the value of these contracts is amortized on a straight line basis over the weighted average life of the respective agreement 
the assessment of these contracts requires the company to make certain judgments  including estimated future cash flow from the applicable properties 
the company is self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation and employee medical and dental coverage 
insurance reserves include the present values of projected settlements for claims 
projected settlements are estimated based on  among other things  historical trends and actuarial data 
the company reviews accounts receivable for collectibility on a routine basis 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that it believes to be uncollectible and amounts that are past due beyond a certain date 
the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts if collection attempts fail 
the company s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts is impacted by  among other things  national and regional economic conditions  including the magnitude and duration of the economic downturn of the united states 
effective january  the company established the westcoast central program fund cpf  organized in accordance with various domestic franchise agreements 
the cpf is responsible for certain advertising services  frequent guest program administration  reservation services  national sales promotions and brand and revenue management services intended to increase sales and enhance the reputation of the company and its franchise owners including the westcoast and red lion branded properties 
contributions by the company to the cpf for owned and managed hotels and contributions by the franchisees  through the individual franchise agreements  total up to of room revenue or can be based on reservation fees  frequent guest program dues and other services

as of december   approximately million of borrowings were outstanding under its million revolver 
although the revolving credit facility matures in june  the company classified its outstanding borrowings under its million revolver as current debt as of december  due to an anticipatory breach of some of the existing covenants in  which have currently not been waived by the lenders 
if the company breaches its covenants and the breach is not waived by the lender one of the lender s remedies under the credit facility is to call the debt due at that time

the historical cash flow of the company has been adequate to service all its normal operating needs  service all interest and regularly scheduled principal payments and capital improvements 
due to the war and the perception of a weak economy there can be no assurance that future operating performance will provide adequate cash flow for the company s needs 
the ability of the company to improve its working capital position through the refinance of its revolving credit facility  improve operating results and disposal of non core assets is dependent upon lending market conditions  the achievement of future operating efficiencies and the liquidity of the real estate market where the company s assets are located 
there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful
