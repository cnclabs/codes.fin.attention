critical accounting policies the corporation s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation s significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note one of the consolidated financial statements 
of these policies  the corporation considers its policy regarding the allowance for loan losses to be one of its most critical accounting policies  because it requires management s most subjective and complex judgments 
the corporation has developed appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  recognizing that this process requires a number of assumptions and estimates with respect to its loan portfolio 
the corporation s assessments may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions  the impact of regulatory examinations and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers which is not known to management at the time of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements 
for additional discussion concerning the corporation s allowance for loan losses and related matters  see allowance for loan losses 
in addition  the corporation also considers its policy regarding equity method investments to be a critical accounting policy due to the assumptions in the valuation of these investments and other subjective factors 
the corporation s equity method investments represent investments in venture capital limited partnerships 
the corporation s recognition of earnings or losses from an equity method investment is determined by the corporation s share of the investee s earnings on a quarterly basis or  in the case of some smaller investments  on an annual basis if there has been no significant change in values 
the limited partnerships generally provide their financial information during the quarter after the end of a given period  and the corporation s policy is to record its share of earnings or losses on these equity method investments in the quarter such information was received 
these limited partnerships record their investments in investee companies on a fair value basis  with changes in the underlying fair values being reflected as an adjustment to their earnings in the period such changes are determined 
the earnings of these limited partnerships  and therefore the amount recorded on an equity method basis by the corporation  are impacted significantly by changes in the underlying value of the companies in which these limited partnerships invest 
all of the companies in which these limited partnerships invest are privately held  and their market values are not readily available 
estimations of these values are made by the management of the limited partnerships and are reviewed by the corporation s management for reasonableness 
the assumptions in the valuation of these investments include the viability of the business model  the ability of the company to obtain alternative financing  the ability to generate revenues in future periods and other subjective factors 
given the inherent risks associated with this type of investment in the current economic environment  there can be no guarantee that there will not be widely varying gains or losses on these equity method investments in future periods 
at december  and december  the total book value of equity method investments was million and million  respectively  and is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
of the million  million represents investments in venture capital partnerships that are small business investment companies sbics  which invest primarily in equity securities 
at december   the corporation s remaining commitment to fund the equity method investments was million and represented commitments to three venture funds that are sbics 
these three venture funds primarily make debt investments in established companies that have a minimum of million in annual revenue 
these remaining commitments are callable in results of operations the corporation s results of operations and financial position are described in the following sections 
refer to table one and table eight for annual and quarterly selected financial data  respectively 
versus the following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of the corporation s results of operations for the years ended december  and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes on pages through net income amounted to million  or per diluted common share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted common share  for the year ended december  net income for the years ended december  and includes certain other items as described in the following paragraph 
the increase in net income was primarily due to i a million increase in net interest income resulting from decreased interest expense  increased loan growth and higher levels of securities outstanding  ii an million increase in noninterest income resulting from growth in service charges on deposit accounts  gains on sale of securities  increased brokerage income and growth in first charter insurance services and iii a million decrease in income taxes due to a decrease in the effective tax rate 
these increases were partially offset by i a million increase in the provision for loan losses due to increased loan growth and higher levels of nonaccrual loans and ii a million increase in noninterest expense which was due to the following factors prepayment costs associated with refinancing million in fixed term advances  a reserve for a contingent liability  expenses associated with the implementation of a new computer operating system in the fourth quarter of  increased occupancy and equipment depreciation expense attributable to the first charter center which was placed into service during april of  additional personnel  and increased incentive compensation based on increases in certain noninterest income categories under established incentive plans 
net income for was also favorably impacted by the adoption of two new accounting standards 
on january  the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 which eliminated goodwill amortization 
the impact of goodwill amortization related to sfas no 
for the year ended december  was   or diluted earnings per share  after tax 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standards no

the impact of goodwill amortization related to sfas no 
for the year ended december  was   or diluted earnings per share  after tax 
net income for the years ended december  and includes certain other items  which are set forth in table two 
these other items are generally considered nonrecurring in nature by management and therefore should be considered in a year over year analysis of results of operations 
for the year ended december   other items primarily consisted of i a million million  or diluted earnings per share  after tax net gain recognized on the sale of excess bank properties  ii an million million  or diluted earnings per share  after tax gain on the sale of securities  iii a million million  or diluted loss per share  after tax net loss on equity method investments  iv a million million or diluted loss per share  after tax prepayment penalty on refinancing of borrowings and v a million million or diluted loss per share  after tax reserve for a contingent liability

net income amounted to million  or per diluted common share  for the three months ended december   compared to million  or per diluted common share  for the three months ended december   representing an increase of million 
net income for the three months ended december  and includes certain other items as described in the following paragraph 
the increase in net income was primarily due to i a million increase in net interest income resulting from decreased interest expense  increased loan growth and higher levels of securities outstanding and ii a million increase in noninterest income due to gains on the sale of securities  increases in mortgage loan fees  service charges on deposit accounts  brokerage revenues  financial management income and insurance services income 
these increases to net income were partially offset by i a million increase in the provision for loan losses due to increased loan growth and higher levels of nonaccrual loans and ii a million increase in noninterest expense primarily due to prepayment costs associated with refinancing million in fixed term advances and a reserve for a contingent liability 
net income for the three months ended december  and includes certain other items  which are set forth in table two 
these other items are generally considered nonrecurring in nature by management and therefore should be considered in a year over year analysis of results of operations

the following table for first charter s reportable business segment compares total income for the years ended december  and table three business segment net income loss years ended december dollars in thousands fcb other operating segments other total consolidated fcb s net income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same year ago period 
the increase was primarily due to an million increase in net interest income resulting from decreased interest expense  increased loan growth and higher levels of securities outstanding and increased noninterest income due to a million net gain recognized on the sale of excess bank properties  million of gains from the sale of fixed income securities available for sale and growth in service charges on deposit accounts 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in the provision for loan losses due to increased loan growth and higher levels of nonaccrual loans during  a million increase in noninterest expense due to prepayment costs associated with refinancing million in fixed term advances  a reserve for a contingent liability  expenses associated with the implementation of a new computer operating system in the fourth quarter of and increased occupancy and equipment depreciation expense attributable to the first charter center which was placed into service during april of other operating segments reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the same year ago period 
the decrease was primarily due to decreased mortgage fee income resulting from mortgage loans having been retained by the bank to replace normal amortization and run off due to refinancings and an increase in noninterest expense due to costs associated with additional personnel and increased incentive compensation based on increases in certain noninterest income categories under established sales incentive plans 
other reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to net loss of million for the same year ago period 
the decrease was primarily due to a million net loss on equity method investments and a increase in interest expense due to higher levels of borrowings 
these decreases were partially offset by a million gain from the sale of equity securities available for sale 
net interest income an analysis of the corporation s net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis and average balance sheet for the last three years is presented in table four 
the changes in net interest income from year to year are analyzed in table five 
net interest income  the difference between total interest income and total interest expense  is the corporation s principal source of earnings 
for the year ended december   net interest income amounted to million  an increase of approximately percent from net interest income of million in the increase in net interest income was driven by decreased interest expense  increased loan growth and higher levels of securities outstanding 
the reduced interest expense for was due to the lower cost of funding in a declining interest rate environment 
the increased securities interest income was due to the higher levels of securities outstanding 
the corporation began to increase its securities available for sale portfolio late in the first quarter of to offset the effects of the dampened loan growth 
as loan growth has increased during  the rate of increase in the securities available for sale portfolio has slowed as compared to average interest earning assets increased approximately million to billion for the year ended december  compared to billion for the same period 
this increase was partially due to a million increase in the corporation s average securities available for sale  excluding the impact of the securitization of million of mortgage loans during the first quarter of the corporation began to increase its securities available for sale portfolio late in the first quarter of  which continued through the end of as described above 
average interest earning assets also increased due to growth in the corporation s average loan portfolio  which increased million  excluding the impact of the securitization of million of mortgage loans during the first quarter of the decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets to percent for the year ended december  compared to percent for the period  resulted principally from the decrease in the average prime rate during to percent compared to percent in the decrease in the average prime rate is attributable to the federal reserve s basis point decrease in the fed funds rate for the year ended december  and basis point decrease for the average yield earned on loans was percent for the year ended december   compared to percent for the same periods 
in addition to the increase in average interest earning assets  the corporation experienced an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million to billion during due to increases in deposits and the use of federal home loan bank fhlb advances to fund loan growth and securities purchases 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to percent in  compared to percent in  primarily due to a declining interest rate environment 
the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits was percent in  down from percent in similarly  the rate paid on other borrowed funds decreased to percent in  compared to percent in the net interest margin tax adjusted net interest income divided by average interest earning assets decreased basis points to percent in  compared to percent in the decrease reflects the impact of the declining interest rate environment in and  which had a negative impact on the net interest margin as assets repriced faster than liabilities 
the addition of lower yielding securities  higher levels of borrowings and competitive forces related to loan and deposit pricing also had a negative impact on the net interest margin

the amount of change that cannot be separated is allocated to each variance proportionately 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the amount charged to earnings which is necessary to maintain an adequate and appropriate allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  the factors which influence changes in the allowance for loan losses have a direct effect on the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses changes from period to period as a result of a number of factors  the most significant of which for the corporation include the following changes in the amounts of loans outstanding  changes in the mix of types of loans  current charge offs and recoveries of loans  changes in impaired loan valuation allowances  changes in credit grades within the portfolio  which arise from a deterioration or an improvement in the performance of the borrower  and changes in historical loss percentages  which are used to estimate current probable loan losses 
in addition  the corporation considers other  more subjective factors which impact the credit quality of the portfolio as a whole  and estimates allocations of allowance for loan losses for these factors as well 
these factors include loan concentrations  economic conditions and operational risks  all of which are measured by the corporation as a percentage of loans outstanding 
changes in these components of the allowance can arise from fluctuations in the underlying percentages used as related loss estimates for these factors  as well as variations in the portfolio balances to which they are applied 
the net change in all of these components of the allowance for loan losses results in the provision for loan losses 
for a more detailed discussion of the corporation s process for estimating the allowance for loan losses  see allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for the three months ended december  amounted to million compared to million for the three months ended december  the increase in the provision for loan losses was due to higher levels of nonaccrual loans and loan growth 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  amounted to million compared to the provision for loan losses of million for the same period 
the increase in the provision for loan losses was due to higher levels of nonaccrual loans during and million in gross loan growth for the year ended december  compared to a decrease of million in gross loans for the year ended december  the loan growth experienced during was primarily in commercial real estate  home equity lines and other secured retail credit 
net charge offs for the three months ended december  decreased to million compared to million for the three months ended december  the million decrease in net charge offs was due to lower commercial loan charge offs as net charge offs for the three months ended december  were inflated due to the charge off of two significant commercial loans 
in addition  the allowance for loan losses was reduced by million due to the reclassification of million of mortgage loans to loans held for sale during the fourth quarter of net charge offs for the year ended december  were million or percent of average loans compared to million or percent of average loans in the same period 
the decrease in net charge offs was due to lower commercial loan charge offs during management continues to monitor the credit quality of the loan portfolio  and charge offs are recorded when the financial condition of the borrower and the likelihood of repayment warrant such actions 
management anticipates that net charge offs may increase as the effect of the slowed economy impacts the financial condition of some customers 
during the year ended december   the corporation made no changes to its estimated loss percentages for economic factors 
as a part of its quarterly assessment of the allowance for loan losses  the corporation reviews key local  regional and national economic information  and assesses its impact on the allowance for loan losses 
based on its review for the year ended december   the corporation noted that economic conditions continue to be weak  however management concluded that the impact on borrowers and local industries in the corporation s primary market area did not change significantly during the period 
accordingly  the corporation did not modify its loss estimate percentage attributable to economic factors in its allowance for loan losses model 
the corporation also continuously reviews its portfolio for any concentrations of loans to any one borrower or industry in the area 
to analyze its concentrations  the corporation prepares various reports showing total loans to borrowers by industry  as well as reports showing total loans to one borrower 
at the present time  the corporation does not believe it is overly concentrated to any industry or specific borrower  and therefore has made no allocations of allowances for loan losses for this factor for any of the periods presented 
in addition to reviewing the impact of the economy and any loan concentrations  the corporation also monitors the amount of operational risk that exists in the portfolio 
this would include the front end underwriting  documentation and closing processes associated with the lending decision 
additional reserves have been set aside in the allowance model for operational risk due to the differences in underwriting methodologies underlying the loans inherited through the mergers of the last five years 
with the implementation of one central loan policy and procedure  this risk appears to be stable 
as a result  the percent of additional allocation for the operational reserve has not changed in recent periods 
the provision for loan losses was impacted by changes in allocations of allowance for loan losses to the various loan types 
higher allocations of allowance for loan losses were required for commercial and consumer loans in december over december lower allocations of allowance for loan losses were required for mortgage loans 
the higher allocations of the allowance for loan losses to commercial loans at december  over december  was due to a decrease in credit grades for certain loans as well as loan growth 
the higher allocations of the allowance for loan losses to consumer loans at december  over december  was due to an increase in the loss percentage estimates used for consumer loans in the allowance model and loan growth 
the corporation estimates loss percentages for the allowance for loan loss model using a migration analysis of historical charge offs 
the growth in historical net charge offs of consumer loans noted in tables thirteen and fourteen has therefore negatively impacted the allowance for loan losses estimate 
these changes were partially offset by a decline in the allocation for mortgage loans due primarily to the reclassification of million of mortgage loans to loans held for sale during the fourth quarter of this reclassification resulted in the transfer of approximately million of allowance for loan losses to loans held for sale 
other than the changes in the historical loss percentages for consumer loans discussed above  management did not make any significant changes in the loss estimation methods during the year that had a significant impact on the provision for loan losses 
noninterest income as presented in table six  noninterest income increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to i a million increase in gains on sale of securities ii a million increase in service charges on deposit accounts resulting from increased overdraft fees due to the implementation of a new automatic overdraft product in late and increased nsf fees  iii a million increase in brokerage income  iv a million increase in first charter insurance services income  and v a million increase in gains on sale of property 
the effects of these increases were partially offset by million of net losses on equity method investments  a million decrease in trading gains and a million decrease in mortgage fee income 
while first charter has experienced record mortgage loan volume during  a portion of mortgage loans originated have been retained by the bank to replace normal amortization and run off due to refinancings 
by placing these mortgage loans on the balance sheet  the mortgage fee income is recognized over the life of the loan versus at the time of sale as in prior periods 
noninterest income was also impacted by the write down of mortgage servicing rights of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
premiums earned on written covered call options on fixed income securities account for a majority of the trading gains 
at december   the corporation did not have any written covered call options outstanding 
it is generally the corporation s policy to structure these option contracts so that there are none outstanding at the end of a reporting period 
see note seventeen of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain related party transactions which impacted deposit service charges in the fourth quarter of and the entire year of the million net loss on equity method investments was primarily due to a loss of million on one equity method investment 
first charter s equity method investments represent investments in venture capital limited partnerships 
first charter recognizes gains or losses from an equity method investment based upon changes in our share of the fair market value of the limited partnerships investments 
these net losses are included in the other segment as presented in note two of the consolidated financial statements 
during  a portion of the fixed income securities available for sale portfolio was repositioned to reduce interest rate risk 
approximately million of securities with longer lives were sold and replaced with securities having shorter lives 
by reducing the average life of the securities available for sale portfolio  management has reduced the market value risk in a possible rising interest rate environment 
in addition  the equity securities portfolio was reduced in order to focus first charter s efforts on other activities that could result in greater returns 
also  as part of the active management of the fixed income securities available for sale portfolio  callable securities that appear to be on the verge of being called at par are sold in order to realize their gain in value 
in addition  million of securities were sold to fund the purchase of bank owned life insurance 
these activities combined with normal portfolio management resulted in gains on sale of securities of million for the year ended december  table six noninterest income years ended december increase decrease dollars in thousands amount percent service charges on deposit accounts financial management income gain on sale of securities loss from equity method investments mortgage loan fees brokerage services income insurance services income trading gains gain on sale of property other total noninterest income noninterest expense as presented in table seven  noninterest expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million a year ago 
the major contributing factors to this increase were million in prepayment penalties associated with the refinancing of million of the corporation s fixed term advances  a reserve for a contingent liability of  additional personnel  increased incentive compensation based on increases in certain noninterest income categories and increased occupancy and equipment depreciation expense attributable to the first charter center which was placed into service during april of in addition  results reflect the depreciation and data processing costs associated with the implementation of a new operating system placed into service during the fourth quarter of noninterest expense was positively impacted by  due to the adoption of sfas no

versus the following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of the corporation s results of operations for the years ended december  and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes on pages through overview net income amounted to million  or diluted net income per share for the year ended december   compared to million or diluted net income per share for the year ended december   representing an increase of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to restructuring charges and merger related expenses of million pre tax million  or per diluted share after tax in  primarily associated with the carolina first merger  which occurred during the increase in net income due to the restructuring charges and merger related expenses was offset in by i a million decrease in net interest income resulting from a compression of the net interest margin and decreasing loan demand during and ii increased expenses resulting primarily from an increase in occupancy and equipment expense resulting from the move into the new first charter center 
net income in and was also impacted by certain other items  which are set forth in table two 
these other items are considered nonrecurring in nature by management and therefore should be considered in year over year analysis of results of operations 
net interest income for the year ended december   net interest income was million  a decrease of approximately percent from net interest income of million in the decrease was the result of the declining interest rate environment resulting from the slowing economy which had a negative impact on the net interest margin as variable rate assets repriced faster than variable rate liabilities 
reduced loan demand  several large loan payoffs and our increased selectivity in seeking new opportunities during as a result of the economic environment also had a negative impact on the net interest margin 
average interest earning assets increased approximately million to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in the corporation s average securities available for sale portfolio for the year ended december   excluding the impact of the securitization of million of mortgage loans during the first quarter of the increase in average securities available for sale was primarily due to net purchases of approximately million in securities available for sale during the year ended december  average interest earning assets also increased due to the purchase of four financial centers in november  as well as growth in the corporation s average loan portfolio  which increased million for the year ended december   excluding the impact of the securitization of million of mortgage loans during the first quarter of the decrease in average yield on interest earning assets to percent in  compared to percent in  resulted principally from the decrease in the average prime rate during to percent  from percent in the decrease in the average prime rate is attributable to the federal reserve s basis point decrease in the fed funds rate during the average yield earned on loans was percent in  compared to percent in provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses in amounted to million compared to the provision for loan losses of million in the decrease in the provision for loan losses was due to lower loan volume in and a significant increase in nonaccrual loans in  which did not recur in partially offsetting these factors in was the effect of higher net charge offs 
as adjusted to remove the effects of the february loan securitization and the sale of million in lower yielding loans in may  gross loans increased million during the year ended december  as compared to an increase of million during the year ended december  noninterest income noninterest income increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in this increase was driven primarily by a percent increase in service charge income on deposit accounts for the year ended december  compared to the same period  which was due to the implementation of revenue enhancing projects as well as repricing opportunities resulting from the acquisition of carolina first 
in addition  the declining rate environment increased mortgage origination volume 
this resulted in additional loan sales to the secondary market and correspondingly greater fee income 
active management of the securities portfolio resulted in the recognition of million in gains on security sales during  compared to losses of million in of the million loss in  million was attributable to a restructuring of the corporation s bond portfolio as a result of rising interest rates at the time of the sales 
continued growth of first charter insurance services  higher brokerage revenue and trading gains also increased noninterest income 
noninterest expense noninterest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million in the comparable period 
the decrease was attributable to the restructuring charges and merger related expenses of million during  primarily associated with the acquisition of carolina first 
this decrease was partially offset during by the additional operating costs associated with the four financial centers acquired during the fourth quarter of  an increase in occupancy and equipment expense as a result of the move into the new first charter center and investments in people and technology to position the corporation for growth 
income tax expense total income tax expense amounted to million for the year ended december  and million for the same comparable period 
the increase in the income tax expense was attributable to an increase in taxable income 
the increase in income tax expense  however  was not proportionate with the decrease in net income because portions of the merger and acquisition costs in were not deductible 
this created a decrease in the effective tax rate to percent in from percent in financial condition summary total assets at december  amounted to billion compared to billion at december  the increase in assets was primarily due to a million increase in securities available for sale and loan growth including loans held for sale of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation purchased million in bank owned life insurance to mitigate rising employee benefit costs 
this investment is classified as an other asset on the balance sheet 
total deposits increased million  or percent  since december  to billion at december  and other borrowings increased million  or percent  since december  to billion at december  the increase in other borrowings was primarily due to increases in fhlb advances principally used to fund loan growth and security purchases 
investment portfolio the securities portfolio  all of which is classified as available for sale  is a component of the corporation s asset liability management strategy 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon liquidity needs  changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risk  and other factors 
securities available for sale are accounted for at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded net of tax as a component of other comprehensive income 
at december   securities available for sale were billion or percent of total assets  compared to billion  or percent of total assets  at december  during  a portion of the fixed income securities available for sale portfolio was repositioned to reduce interest rate risk 
approximately million of securities with longer average lives were sold and replaced with securities having shorter average lives 
by reducing the average life of the securities available for sale portfolio  management has reduced the market value risk in a possible rising interest rate environment 
in addition  the equity securities portfolio was reduced in order to focus first charter s efforts on other activities that could result in greater returns 
as part of the active management of the fixed income securities available for sale portfolio  callable securities which appear to be on the verge of being called at par are sold in order to realize their gain in value 
in addition  in order to offset increasing employee benefit costs and improve earnings  the corporation sold million in bonds  recognized gains and reinvested the proceeds into bank owned life insurance 
this investment is classified as an other asset on the balance sheet and the income is recognized as other noninterest income 
management estimates that this transaction will have a million positive impact to earnings in the carrying value of securities available for sale was approximately million above their amortized cost at december  and million above their amortized cost at december  the weighted average life of the portfolio decreased to years at december  compared to years at december  the following table shows  as of december    and  the carrying value of i us government obligations  ii us government agency obligations  iii mortgage backed securities  iv state and municipal obligations  and v equity securities 
table nine investment portfolio december  dollars in thousands securities available for sale us government obligations us government agency obligations mortgage backed securities state  county  and municipal obligations equity securities total loan portfolio the corporation s loan portfolio at december  consisted of four major categories commercial  financial and agricultural  real estate construction  real estate mortgage  and installment 
during  the corporation changed the presentation of these loan categories to more accurately reflect how the corporation manages the loan portfolio 
the new loan portfolio categories are as follows commercial non real estate  commercial real estate  construction  mortgage  consumer  and home equity 
within these six segments the corporation targets customers in its footprint  works within most business segments and focuses on a relationship based business model 
pricing is driven by quality  loan size  the corporation s relationship with the customer and by competition 
the corporation is primarily a secured lender in all these loan categories 
the corporation s loans are generally five years or less in duration with the exception of home equity lines and residential mortgages 
commercial non real estate the corporation s commercial non real estate lending program is generally targeted to serve small to middle market businesses with sales of million or less in the corporation s geographic area 
commercial lending includes commercial  financial  agricultural and industrial loans 
in addition  the corporation has a small loan participation program known as the strategic partners program through which loans are purchased and sold commercial real estate  commercial non real estate and construction loans with other community banks 
the corporation does not usually participate in syndicated loans 
pricing on commercial non real estate loans  driven largely by the corporation s relationship with the customer and by competition  is usually tied to market indexes  such as the prime rate  the london interbank offer rate libor or rates on us treasury securities 
commercial real estate similar to commercial non real estate lending  the corporation s commercial real estate lending program is generally targeted to serve small to middle market business with sales of million or less in the corporation s geographic area 
the real estate loans are both owner occupied and project related 
as with commercial non real estate loans  pricing on commercial real estate loans  driven largely by the corporation s relationship with the customer and by competition  is usually tied to market indexes  such as the prime rate  libor or rates on us treasury securities 
construction real estate construction loans include both commercial and residential construction permanent loans  which are intended to convert to permanent family residential mortgage loans upon completion of the construction 
loans for commercial construction are usually to in market developers  builders  businesses  individuals or real estate investors for the construction of commercial structures in the corporation s market area 
loans are made for purposes including  but not limited to  the construction of industrial facilities  apartments  shopping centers  office buildings  homes and warehouses 
the properties may be constructed for sale  lease or owner occupancy 
mortgage the corporation originates family residential mortgage loans throughout the corporation s footprint and in reston  virginia which is a loan production office 
the corporation offers a full line of products including conventional  conforming  and jumbo fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages which are originated and sold into the secondary market  however  from time to time a portion of this production is retained 
consumer the corporation offers a wide variety of consumer loan products 
various types of secured and unsecured loans are marketed to qualifying existing customers and to other creditworthy candidates in the corporation s market area 
unsecured loans  including revolving credits eg credit cards  checking account overdraft protection and personal lines of credit are provided and various installment loan products such as vehicle loans are offered 
all consumer lending is centrally decisioned and documented 
home equity home equity loans and lines are secured by first and second deeds of trust on the borrower s principal dwelling 
as with all consumer lending  home equity loans are centrally decisioned and documented to ensure the underwriting conforms to the corporate lending policy 
loan administration and underwriting the corporation s credit risk policy and procedures are centralized for every loan type 
in addition  all mortgage and consumer loans are centrally decisioned 
all loans flow through an independent closing unit to ensure proper documentation 
lastly  all known collection or problem loans are centrally managed by experienced workout personnel 
to monitor the effectiveness of policies and procedures  management maintains a set of asset quality standards for past dues  nonaccrual and watch list loans and monitors the trends of these standards over time 
these standards are approved by the board of directors and reviewed quarterly for compliance 
the bank s chief credit officer is responsible for the continuous assessment of the bank s risk profile as well as making any necessary adjustments to policies and procedures 
commercial loans less than  may be approved by experienced loan officers  within their loan authority 
commercial and commercial real estate loans are approved by signature authority requiring at least two experienced lenders for any relationships greater than  and an independent risk manager whenever the relationship is greater than million 
all relationships greater than million receive a comprehensive annual review by the senior lending officers of the bank  which is then reviewed by the independent risk management officers and the bank s loan committees 
commitments over million are further reviewed by senior lending officers of the bank  the chief credit officer and both an executive loan committee comprised of executive management and a board of directors loan committee 
these oversight committees provide policy  process  product and specific relationship direction to the lending personnel 
the corporation has a general target lending limit to one borrower of million  however  at times some loans may exceed that limit 
as described above  the corporation s loan portfolio consists of loans made for a variety of commercial and consumer purposes 
because commercial loans are made based to a great extent on the corporation s assessment of borrowers income  cash flow  character and ability to repay  such loans are viewed as involving a higher degree of credit risk than is the case with residential mortgage loans or consumer loans 
to manage this risk  the corporation s commercial loan portfolio is managed under a defined process which includes underwriting standards and risk assessment  procedures for loan approvals  loan grading  ongoing identification and management of credit deterioration and portfolio reviews to assess loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with the corporation s credit policies and procedures 
in general  consumer loans including mortgage and home equity are deemed less risky than commercial loans 
commercial loans including commercial real estate  commercial non real estate and construction loans are generally larger in size and more complex than consumer loans 
commercial real estate loans are deemed less risky than commercial non real estate and construction loans  as the collateral value of real estate generally maintains its value better than non real estate or construction collateral 
consumer loans being smaller in size provides risk diversity across the portfolio 
as mortgage loans are secured by first liens on the consumer s primary residence  they are the corporation s least risky loan type 
home equity loans are deemed less risky than unsecured consumer loans as home equity loans and lines are secured by first or second deeds of trust on the borrower s principal dwelling 
a centralized decisioning process is in place to control the risk of the consumer  home equity and mortgage loan portfolio 
this process is detailed in the underwriting guidelines which covers each retail loan product type from underwriting  servicing  compliance issues and closing procedures 
loan review has been and is currently outsourced to a consulting group which performs loan quality and process examinations 
this function is currently transitioning to an in house function in loans increased percent to billion at december  compared to billion at december  during the fourth quarter of  million of mortgage loans were reclassified to loans held for sale 
these loans were securitized during the first quarter of loan growth experienced during was primarily in commercial real estate  home equity lines and other secured retail credit 
the corporation s primary market area includes the state of north carolina but predominately centers around the metro region of charlotte 
at december   the majority of the total loan portfolio  as well as a substantial portion of the commercial and real estate loan portfolio  represents loans to borrowers within this metro region 
an economic downturn in our primary market area could adversely affect our business 
the diversity of the region s economic base tends to provide a stable lending environment 
no significant concentration of credit risk has been identified due to the diverse industrial base in the region 
in the normal course of business  there are various outstanding commitments to extend credit  which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the unused portion of preapproved lines of credit totaled million  unfunded loan commitments totaled million and standby letters of credit aggregated million 
these amounts represent the bank s exposure to credit risk  and in the opinion of management  have no more than the normal lending risk that the bank commits to its borrowers 
management expects that these commitments can be funded through normal operations 
the table below summarizes loans in the classifications indicated as of december      and as previously stated  loan categories have been changed to more accurately reflect how the corporation manages the loan portfolio

total nonperforming assets includes nonaccrual loans and other real estate and loans days or more past due and still accruing increased to million at december  compared to million at september  as a percentage of total assets  nonperforming assets increased to percent at december  compared to percent at september  nonaccrual loans at december  increased to million compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to the addition of several commercial loans to nonaccrual status 
this increase was partially offset by the sale of million of residential nonaccrual loans during the third quarter of and the transfer of one commercial loan from nonaccrual status to other real estate 
other real estate  received through loan foreclosure  increased to million from million at december  the increase in other real estate was primarily due to the foreclosure on several commercial relationships during this increase was partially offset by the sale of million of residential other real estate during the third quarter of total nonperforming assets includes nonaccrual loans and other real estate and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest at december  were million or percent of total loans and other real estate  compared to million or percent of total loans and other real estate at december  interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans and restructured loans for the years ended december   and  had they performed in accordance with their original terms  amounted to approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
interest income on all such loans included in the results of operations for  and amounted to approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
nonaccrual loans at december  were not concentrated in any one industry and primarily consisted of several large credits secured by real estate 
management anticipates that nonaccrual loans may increase in the near term as some customers continue to experience difficulties in this current economic environment 
as discussed elsewhere herein  management has taken current economic conditions into consideration when estimating the allowance for loan losses 
the determination to discontinue the accrual of interest is based on a review of each loan 
generally  accrual of interest is discontinued on loans days past due as to principal or interest unless in management s opinion collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization  guarantees or other security and the loan is in the process of collection 
management s policy for any accruing loan greater than days past due is to perform an analysis of the loan  including a consideration of the financial position of the borrower and any guarantor as well as the value of the collateral  and use this information to make an assessment as to whether collectibility of the principal and interest appears probable 
if such collectibility is not probable  the loans are placed on nonaccrual status 
loans are returned to accrual status when management determines  based on an evaluation of the underlying collateral together with the borrower s payment record and financial condition  that the borrower has the ability and intent to meet the contractual obligations of the loan agreement 
the table below summarizes the corporation s nonperforming assets and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest as of the dates indicated 
table twelve nonperforming and problem assets december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans other real estate total nonperforming assets loans days or more past due and still accruing interest total nonperforming assets and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets loans and other real estate ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans x x x x x summary of loan loss and recovery experience the table below presents certain data for the years ended december      and  including the following i the average amount of net loans outstanding during the year  ii the allowance for loan losses at the beginning of the year  iii the provision for loan losses  iv loans charged off and recovered v loan charge offs  net  vi the allowance for loan losses at the end of the year  vii the ratio of net charge offs to average loans and viii the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to loans at year end 
the categories of charge offs and recoveries presented in table thirteen are similar to the categories presented in prior years

due to the restatement of historical financial information for the years ended december   and  as the result of poolings of interests mergers  it is not possible to provide information for these years in the categories of loans used below 
table fourteen allowance for credit losses years ended december  dollars in thousands balance  january loan charge offs commercial non real estate commercial real estate construction mortgage consumer home equity total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial non real estate commercial real estate construction mortgage consumer home equity other total recoveries of loans previously charged off net charge offs provision for loan losses adjustment for loans sold  securitized or transferred to held for sale balance  december average loans  net net charge offs to average loans allowance for loan losses to gross loans at year end allowance for loan losses the corporation s allowance for loan losses consists of three components valuation allowances computed on impaired loans in accordance with sfas no 
 valuation allowances determined by applying historical loss rates to those loans not considered impaired  and valuation allowances for factors which management believes are not reflected in the historical loss rates or that otherwise need to be considered when estimating the allowance for loan losses 
these three components are estimated quarterly by credit risk management  and along with a narrative analysis  comprise the corporation s allowance for loan losses model 
the resulting estimate is used to determine if the allowance for loan losses recorded by management is adequate and appropriate for each period 
the first component of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation allowance for impaired loans  is computed based on documented reviews performed by the corporation s credit risk management on individual impaired commercial loans greater than  credit risk management typically estimates these valuation allowances by considering the fair value of the underlying collateral for each impaired loan using current appraisals or estimates of values 
the results of these estimates are shared with the special asset committee of fcb  and are then subject to review by the loan committee of the board of directors of the bank 
these estimates are updated periodically as circumstances change 
changes in the dollar amount of impaired loans or in the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral can impact the valuation allowance on impaired loans and  therefore  the overall allowance for loan losses 
the second component of the allowance for loan losses  the portion attributable to all other loans not considered impaired  is determined by applying historical loss rates to the outstanding balance of loans 
for purposes of computing these estimates  the portfolio is segmented as follows commercial loans by credit risk grade and consumer loans  which include mortgage  general consumer  consumer real estate  home equity and consumer unsecured 
commercial loans are segmented further by credit grade  so that separate loss factors are applied to each pool of commercial loans 
the historical loss factors applied to the various segments are determined using a migration analysis tool that computes current loss estimates by loan type or  in the case of commercial loans  by credit grade using a trailing loss history database 
since the migration analysis is based on trailing data  the percentage loss estimates can change based on actual losses in that trailing period 
changes in commercial loan credit grades or in the mix of the portfolio can also impact this component of the allowance for loan losses from period to period 
the third component of the allowance for loan losses is intended to capture the various risk elements of the loan portfolio which are not sufficiently captured in the historical loss rates 
these factors currently include economic risk  operational risk and concentration risk 
economic risk relates to the impact of current economic conditions on the corporation s borrower base  the effects of which may not be realized by the corporation in the form of charge offs for several periods 
the corporation monitors and documents various local  regional and national economic data  and makes subjective estimates of the impact of changes in economic conditions on the allowance for loan losses 
operational risk includes factors such as the likelihood of loss on a loan because of inadequate underwriting 
in recent periods  the corporation has made loss estimates for certain types of loans that were either acquired from other institutions in mergers or were underwritten using policies that are no longer in effect at the corporation 
these identified loans are considered to have higher risk of loss than currently reflected in historical loss rates of the corporation  so additional estimates of loss are made by management 
concentration risk includes the risk of loss due to extensions of credit to a particular industry  loan type or borrower that may be troubled 
the corporation monitors its portfolio for any excessive concentrations of loans during each period  and if any excessive concentrations are noted  estimates of loss would be made 
losses for all of these factors are estimates since certain loans will generally respond differently to changes in these factors 
accordingly  changes in the allowance for loan losses for these subjective factors can arise from changes in the balance and types of outstanding loans  as well as changes in the underlying conditions which drive a change in the percentage used 
as more fully discussed below  the corporation continually monitors the portfolio in an effort to identify any other factors which may have an impact on loss estimates within the portfolio 
all estimates of the loan portfolio risk  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  are subject to general and local economic conditions  among other factors  which are unpredictable and beyond the corporation s control 
since a significant portion of the loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans and loans to area businesses  the corporation is subject to continued risk that the real estate market and economic conditions could continue to change and could result in future losses and require increases in the provision for loan losses 
management currently uses several measures to assess and control the loan portfolio risk 
for example  all loans over million are reviewed by the bank s loan committees  and any issues regarding risk assessments of those credits are addressed by the bank s senior risk managers and factored into future lending decisions 
commitments over million are further reviewed by senior lending officers of the bank  the chief credit officer and both an executive loan committee comprised of executive management and a board of directors loan committee 
the corporation also continues to employ an independent third party risk assessment group to review the underwriting  documentation and risk grading process 
this third party group reviews loans on a sampling basis at regular intervals throughout the year 
the third party s evaluation and report is shared with executive management and the board of directors loan and audit committees 
this function is currently transitioning to an in house function in at december  the allowance for loan losses was million or percent of gross loans compared to million or percent at december  and million  or percent at december  the allowance model was influenced throughout by loan growth  charge off behavior and deteriorating asset quality 
while higher allocations of allowance for loan losses were required for commercial and consumer loans in december over december  lower allocations of allowance for loan losses were required for mortgage loans 
the higher allocations of the allowance for loan losses to commercial loans at december  over december  was due to a decrease in credit grades for certain loans as well as loan growth 
the higher allocations of the allowance for loan losses to consumer loans at december  over december  was due to an increase in the loss percentage estimates used for consumer loans in the allowance model and loan growth 
the corporation estimates loss percentages for the allowance for loan loss model using a migration analysis of historical charge offs 
the growth in historical net charge offs of consumer loans noted in tables thirteen and fourteen has therefore negatively impacted the allowance for loan losses estimate 
these changes were partially offset by a decline in the allocation for mortgage loans due primarily to the reclassification of million of mortgage loans to loans held for sale during the fourth quarter of this reclassification resulted in the transfer of approximately million of allowance for loan losses to loans held for sale 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover inherent losses in the bank s loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
management believes it has established the allowance in consideration of the current economic environment 
while management uses the best information available to make evaluations  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions 
additionally  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowances for loan losses 
such agencies may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowances based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
the following table presents the dollar amount of the allowance for loan losses applicable to major loan categories and the percentage of the loans in each category to total loans as of december     and table fifteen allocation of the allowance for loan losses december  loan loan loan loan loan dollars in thousands amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans commercial real estate commercial non real estate construction mortgage consumer home equity total the allowance amounts assigned to each category of loans represent the historical loss experience of the loans adjusted for current economic events or conditions 
deposits table four provides information on the average amounts of deposits and the rates paid by deposit category 
total deposits at december  were billion  a percent increase from december  deposit growth has occurred across every major category 
increases in money market and demand deposit were due to marketing campaigns directed toward packaging and promoting these accounts more effectively 
increases in certificates of deposit were due to the purchase of million of brokered certificates of deposits used as a funding source 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation introduced the checking account marketing program champ 
the emphasis of this program is to develop new customer relationships  generate additional fee income opportunities  and to shift the funding mix towards lower cost funding sources 
as a result   new checking accounts were opened during the fourth quarter of  a percent increase over the fourth quarter of see note eleven of the consolidated financial statements for further details on deposits 
other borrowings other borrowings increased million during the year  to billion at december   from million at december  the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and an increase of million in fhlb advances 
these borrowings were principally used to fund loan growth and securities purchases 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation incurred million in prepayment penalties associated with the refinancing of million in fixed term advances 
the following is a schedule of other borrowings which consists of the following categories securities sold under repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased and fhlb borrowings for the years ended december   and table sixteen other borrowings dollars in thousands federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  fhlb and other borrowings balance as of december average balance maximum outstanding at any month end interest rate as of december average interest rate at december   fcb had one available line of credit with the fhlb totaling million with approximately million outstanding 
the outstanding amounts consisted of million maturing in  million maturing in  million maturing in  million maturing in  million maturing in and million maturing in in addition  the fhlb requires banks to pledge collateral to secure the advances as described in the line of credit agreement 
the collateral consists of qualifying family residential mortgage loans  qualifying commercial loans and securities pledged to fhlb 
liquidity liquidity is the ability to maintain cash flows adequate to fund operations and meet obligations and other commitments on a timely and cost effective basis 
liquidity is provided by the ability to attract retail deposits  by current earnings  and by a strong capital base that enables the corporation to use alternative funding sources that complement normal sources 
management s asset liability policy is to maximize net interest income while continuing to provide adequate liquidity to meet continuing loan demand and deposit withdrawal requirements and to service normal operating expenses 
the corporation s primary source of funding is from customer deposits  other borrowings  loan repayments  and securities available for sale 
if additional funding sources are needed  the bank has access to federal fund lines at correspondent banks and borrowings from the federal reserve discount window 
in addition to these sources  as described above  the bank is a member of the fhlb  which provides access to fhlb lending sources 
at december   the bank had an available line of credit with the fhlb totaling million with million outstanding 
at december   the bank also had federal funds back up lines of credit totaling million  of which there were no amounts outstanding 
at december   the corporation had lines of credit with suntrust bank totaling million with million outstanding and commercial paper outstandings of million 
during  the corporation incurred million in prepayment penalties associated with the refinancing of million in fixed term fhlb advances 
another source of liquidity is the securities available for sale portfolio 
see investment portfolio for further discussion 
management believes the bank s sources of liquidity are adequate to meet loan demand  operating needs and deposit withdrawal requirements 
the corporation has existing contractual obligations that will require payments in future periods 
the following table presents aggregated information about such payments to be made in future periods 
the corporation anticipates refinancing  during  any contractual obligations that are due in less than one year 
table seventeen contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than dollars in thousands year years years over years total other borrowings lease obligations equity method investees funding deposits total contractual cash obligations deposits with no stated maturity demand  money market  and savings deposits are presented in the less than one year category 
asset liability management and interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of the corporation s asset liability management strategy is to enhance earnings through balance sheet growth while reducing or minimizing the risk caused by interest rate changes 
one method used to manage interest rate sensitivity is to measure  over various time periods  the interest rate sensitivity positions  or gaps  however  this method addresses only the magnitude of timing differences and does not address earnings or market value 
management uses an earnings simulation model to assess the amount of earnings at risk due to changes in interest rates 
management believes this method more accurately measures interest rate risk 
this model is updated monthly and is based on a range of interest rate shock scenarios 
under the corporation s policy  the limit for interest rate risk is percent of net interest income when considering an increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points over a twelve month period 
assuming a basis point pro rata increase in interest rates over a twelve month period  the corporation s sensitivity to interest rate risk would positively impact net interest income by approximately percent of net interest income at december  assuming a basis point pro rata decrease in interest rates over a twelve month period  the corporation s sensitivity to interest rate risk would negatively impact net interest income by approximately percent of net interest income at december  although the corporation s policy for interest shock scenarios is an increase or decrease of basis points  in the current low interest rate environment the decreased interest rate shock scenario is equal to the fed funds rate of basis points 
both of the rate shock scenarios are within management s acceptable range 
from time to time  the corporation may use derivative financial instruments including futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  option contracts  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
at december   the corporation had no such derivative financial instruments 
refer to notes one and seven of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations for a discussion of the corporation s use of written over the counter covered call options during the corporation does not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements 
the corporation is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require collateral from the borrower if deemed necessary by the corporation 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the corporation to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party up to a stipulated amount and with specified terms and conditions 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by the corporation until the instrument is exercised 
refer to note sixteen of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of commitments 
the following table presents aggregated information about commitments of the corporation which could impact future periods 
table eighteen commitments as of december  amount of commitment expiration per period less than total amounts dollars in thousands year years years over years committed lines of credit standby letters of credit loan commitments total commitments table nineteen summarizes the expected maturities and weighted average effective yields and rates associated with certain of the corporation s significant non trading financial instruments 
cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold and interest bearing bank deposits  are excluded from table nineteen as their respective carrying values approximate fair values 
these financial instruments generally expose the corporation to insignificant market risk as they have either no stated maturities or an average maturity of less than days and interest rates that approximate market rates 
however  these financial instruments could expose the corporation to interest rate risk by requiring more or less reliance on alternative funding sources  such as long term debt 
for further information on the fair value of financial instruments  see note eighteen of the consolidated financial statements 
the mortgage backed securities are shown at their weighted average expected life  obtained from an outside evaluation of the average remaining life of each security based on historic prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgages at december  demand deposits  money market accounts and certain savings deposits are presented in the earliest maturity window because they have no stated maturity

the increase was partially offset by the payment of million for the purchase and retirement of  shares of common stock and the payment of million for the settlement of the december  share repurchase agreement as described in note fourteen on page of the corporation s annual report on form k for the year ended december  the securities available for sale portfolio had an unrealized net gain of million net of tax at december   compared to an unrealized net gain of million net of tax at december  the increase in the unrealized gain was due to a decline in the yield curve 
the principal asset of the corporation is its investment in the bank 
thus  the corporation derives its principal source of income through dividends from the bank 
certain regulatory and other requirements restrict the lending of funds by the bank to the corporation and the amount of dividends which can be paid to the corporation 
in addition  certain regulatory agencies may prohibit the payment of dividends by the bank if they determine that such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
see note nineteen of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation and the bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the applicable federal regulatory agencies 
under the standards of the federal reserve board  the corporation must maintain a minimum ratio of tier i capital as defined to total risk weighted assets of percent and a minimum ratio of total capital as defined to risk weighted assets of percent 
tier i capital is comprised of total shareholders equity calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles less certain intangible assets and excluding unrealized gains or losses on securities available for sale 
total capital is comprised of tier i capital plus certain adjustments  the largest of which for the corporation is the allowance for loan losses up to percent of risk weighted assets 
total capital must consist of at least percent of tier capital 
risk weighted assets refer to the on and off balance sheet exposures of the corporation adjusted for their related risk levels using amounts set forth in federal reserve standards 
in addition to the aforementioned risk based capital requirements  the corporation is subject to a leverage capital requirement  requiring a minimum ratio of tier i capital as defined previously to total adjusted average assets of percent to percent 
the bank also has similar regulatory capital requirements imposed by the federal reserve board 
see note twenty of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of requirements 
at december   the corporation and the bank were in compliance with all existing capital requirements 
the most recent notifications from the corporation s and the bank s various regulators categorized the corporation and the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
in the judgment of management  there have been no events or conditions since those notifications that would change the well capitalized status of the corporation or the bank 
the corporation s capital requirements are summarized in the table below table twenty capital ratios risk based capital leverage capital tier capital total capital dollars in thousands amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage actual required excess percentage of total adjusted average assets 
the frb minimum leverage ratio requirement is percent to percent  depending on the institution s composite rating as determined by its regulators 
the frb has not advised the corporation of any specific requirement applicable to it
