item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations covers in part periods prior to our initial public offering in august as a result of the initial public offering  we significantly changed our capitalization 
accordingly  the results of operations for periods subsequent to the initial public offering are not necessarily comparable to prior periods 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report 
overview in  we were incorporated as a distinct entity and established as the parent of a stand alone worldwide business 
prior to this time  we operated as a separate division of hyundai electronics  now hynix semiconductor  one of the world s largest semiconductor manufacturers and a member of the hyundai group  the south korean conglomerate 
in  as part of a recapitalization  a group of equity investors along with management obtained control of chippac 
this transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization 
our revenue consists of fees charged to our customers for packaging  testing  and distribution of their integrated circuits 
from to  revenue increased from million to million  a cumulative annual growth rate of  primarily from the growth of substrate or bga packaging  the growth of test revenue and the acquisition of our malaysian business in the semiconductor industry is inherently volatile with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
these downturns have been characterized by  among other things  diminished product demand  excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices 
the semiconductor industry is presently recovering from the worst downturn in its history 
due to the severity of this downturn for the semiconductor industry and for our customers  we experienced the first decline in revenue on a year over year basis in our history in our revenue for the year ended december  increased to million or by compared to the year ended december  our continuing growth will depend upon factors influenced by current economic conditions such as replenishment of inventory in the electronics supply chain  gradual recovery in our end markets and the ramp up of new customers acquired in we are positioned in the fastest growth markets 
we have re engineered our business models over the last two years to focus on products and customers in the fastest growth segments of the industry such as chips for use in wireless  broadband  consumer and automotive products 
however  we are still solidly positioned in the computing and industrial markets  which will benefit from an overall economic recovery when it occurs 
management is continually re evaluating estimates and the expectations above could and probably will change as the year unfolds 
the following table describes the composition of revenue by product group and test services  as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  substrate lead frame test total

revenue was million in the year ended december   an increase of from the year ended december  the increase in revenue is primarily due to growth in our substrate and test product lines and the combination of higher end market demand for our customers products and new customer and program wins in the year as compared to unit volumes in also increased versus the year gross profit 
gross profit during the year ended december  was million  an increase of from the year ended december  gross margin as a percent of revenue was for the year versus for the year the actions taken by us  including reductions in work force and tight cost controls coupled with increased unit volume and higher equipment utilization  contributed to the increased gross profit realized for the year ended december  these results were reduced by the effect of higher gold prices and the appreciation of the south korean won against the united states dollar when compared to the year ended december  selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million in the year ended december   an increase of from the year ended december  the increase in expenses was primarily due to implementation of strict cost reductions taken in in reaction to the decline in revenue 
the cost controls in included mandatory shut down days  salary reductions  travel restrictions  and deferment of expenditures where the timing could be delayed 
in addition  we incurred additional expenses for our various employee incentive programs as a result of our improved results during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  
table of contents research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  in the year ended december  our research and development expenses in represent a decrease from similar expenses in although we increased the number of research and development employees and internal resources in the year compared to the year  we were engaged in a significant project that required external spending during a comparable level of external spending was not required during restructuring and other charges 
in the first and fourth quarter of  we approved restructuring plans to realign our organization and reduce operating costs 
these actions were designed to better align our existing workforce and to reduce operating expenses 
these plans were a combination of reductions in work force and employee furloughs 
accordingly  our restructuring plans included reduction of associated employee positions by approximately and worldwide in connection with the first and fourth quarter plans  respectively 
restructuring and related charges of million and million were expensed during the first and fourth quarter of  respectively 
the entire first quarter charge of million was related to employee separations and furloughs 
the fourth quarter charge was comprised of million related to employee separations and million of other charges for the forgiveness of loans to executive officers 
during the year ended december   we utilized million of the restructuring accrual and completed another of the planned employee separations 
we also utilized the million of loan reserves 
cumulatively  we have completed of the planned employee separations 
due to stronger than expected performance from our korean subsidiary and the sale of our plating line in korea which we had planned on shutting down  reserve releases in the amount of million were credited to restructuring charges in our statement of operations for december  we plan no further terminations or other restructuring activities related to our planned actions reserved in this credit was reduced by a restructuring action in our malaysian plant in which million was incurred to terminate employees 
this action was not included in the reserves 
in addition  we wrote down impaired assets by million in the fourth quarter of there were no comparable write offs in the year ended december  interest expense 
total outstanding interest bearing debt decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in debt outstanding of million from december  to december  was due to the million pay down of our term loans and the million paydown of our revolving line of credit  offset by an increase in foreign loans of million 
the decrease in debt was funded by our january and may public offerings of our common stock 
related interest expense was million for the year ended december   a decrease of compared to the year ended december  the reduction in interest expense was primarily due to the combination of reduced interest rates along with the reduction in debt outstanding 
foreign currency losses 
we had net foreign currency losses of million in the year ended december  compared to a net foreign currency gain of million in the year ended december  these non cash losses are primarily due to the fluctuations between the exchange rate of the united states dollar and the south korean won related to long term pension benefits payable to our south korean employees 
income taxes 
global income tax expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  for effective tax rates of approximately in and in in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a valuation reserve that reversed previously recorded benefits in and previous years 
we have a mix of tax rates across the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
the tax provision for does not take into account any future benefit from loss carryforwards  which we may realize once we again achieve profitability 
extraordinary item 
a portion of the proceeds from our may public offering was used to extinguish term loan a and our capital expenditure loan and substantially pay down term loan b under our senior credit facilities 
as a result  capitalized debt issuance costs of million were written off and the charge was included in the results for the three and six month periods ended june  with no comparable results for the same periods in there is no tax benefit since the costs were written off in a tax jurisdiction that provides no benefit 
net loss available to common stockholders 
as a result of the items above  the net loss available to common stockholders decreased to million loss for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue was million in the year ended december   a decrease of from the year ended december  the decline in revenue was a result of lower end market demand for our customers products 
this decrease was realized across all the end markets we serve and was not significantly concentrated in any one end market 
we believe that our customers purchased product for their inventory in amounts consistent with historical demand 
thus  as end user demand dropped  our customers inventories increased  thereby decreasing demand for our products 

table of contents gross profit 
gross profit during the year ended december  was million  a decrease of from the year ended december  the majority of the decrease was caused by lower demand leading to lower equipment utilization as well as lower average selling prices in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  equipment utilization was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
although reductions in force  furloughs  plant shutdown days and other cost saving methods were used in the year ended december   they were insufficient to offset the decline in revenue 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million in the year ended december   a decrease of from the year ended december  expenses declined compared to  because we implemented strict cost controls in reaction to the decline in revenue and because of the reductions in force we implemented in the first quarter of in addition  we incurred staffing expenses in the second half of related to our initial public offering that did not occur in research and development expense 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  in the year ended december  our research and development expenses in represent an increase from similar expenses in the increases were mainly due to expenses related to power packaging technology  new processes development and flip chip technology development 
restructuring and other charges 
restructuring  write down of impaired assets and other charges 
during the year ended december   we wrote down impaired assets by million 
the asset write down relates primarily to our manufacturing assets in the assembly and test facilities in south korea and malaysia 
the company determined that due to excess capacity the future expected cash flows related to equipment for certain niche package types will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the manufacturing equipment for those package types in the facility 
the carrying values of these assets were written down to the estimated fair market value and will continue to be depreciated over the remaining useful lives 
there were no equivalent write offs in the year ended december  in addition  we recorded expenses associated with reduction in force and furlough costs of million and a loss reserve of million on executive officers loans forgiveness in  that occurred in the year ended december  with no comparable costs in interest expense 
total outstanding interest bearing debt increased to million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in debt was primarily due to draw down of our revolving credit line for general corporate purposes and issuance of million of convertible debt and million of additional high yield borrowings in june related interest expense was million for the year ended december   a decrease of compared to the year ended december  the reduction in interest expense was primarily due to reduced interest rates on our debt 
foreign currency gains 
net foreign currency gains were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these non cash gains are primarily due to the fluctuations between the exchange rate of the united states dollar and the south korean won related to long term pension benefits payable to our south korean employees 
other income and expenses 
other income and expenses  net  was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other expenses for december  includes the one time payment of million  paid to bain capital and sxi group in exchange for the termination of two advisory agreements  which were entered into during our recapitalization in there were no equivalent expenditures related to this one time payment in the year ended december  accretion of dividends and recorded value of the intel warrant 
accretion of dividends on preferred stock and the recorded value of the intel warrant was in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  all preferred stock was redeemed or converted to non dividend bearing class a common stock concurrent with our initial public offering in august the intel warrant expired unexercised in february income taxes 
income tax expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  for an effective tax rates of approximately in and in concurrently with our recapitalization on august   the company was reorganized and as a result now has operations and earnings in jurisdictions with relatively low income tax rates  or where we enjoy tax holidays or other similar tax benefits 

table of contents net loss income available to common stockholders 
as a result of the items above  we incurred a net loss available to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december  critical accounting policies we believe the following accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our significant judgments 
we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in fixed assets  intellectual property and related intangible assets 
management evaluates the valuation of these assets every quarter paying special attention to events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that their carrying amount might not be recoverable 
we determine whether or not the assets are recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the assets and if not  we calculate the amount of the impairment charge based on estimated discounted future cash flows to be generated by the assets or their appraised fair value 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail rather than those used in estimating future cash flows  significantly different determination of recoverability or of fair value for these assets and results of operations could be reported 
we recorded an asset impairment charge of million for the year ended december  with no comparable amount in in addition  management uses judgment when setting expected asset useful lives for long lived assets 
the asset useful lives used are based on historical experience and future expectations 
however  business conditions or underlying technology may change in the future which could cause a change in asset lives 
any change in lives would cause a significant change in depreciation and amortization 
after the recapitalization see note to the consolidated financial statements  we reassessed the asset useful lives for our long lived assets in and changed the useful lives from five years to eight years 
this change resulted in depreciation expense for the year ended december  being million lower than would have been recorded using five year lives 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
furthermore  if anticipated volume levels turn out to be different  this would impact reductions to revenue and accrued customer rebates 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in the year ended december   we have maintained the valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of utilization of certain deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our ongoing primary cash needs are for operations and equipment purchases 
we spent million on capital expenditures during the year ended december  compared to million in capital expenditures during the year ended december  we anticipate spending million in capital expenditures in under the terms of the agreement relating to our acquisition of the malaysian business  during the period from june  to june   intersil is entitled to receive additional contingent incentive payments based upon the achievement of milestones relating to the transfer of business previously subcontracted by intersil to a third party 
in the event that intersil was to achieve all the milestones  we would pay intersil an additional sum of approximately million in the aggregate 
as of december   we have cumulatively paid intersil million under this arrangement 
on january   we sold  shares of class a common stock in an underwritten public offering for per share 
on february   we sold an additional  shares of class a common stock in conjunction with the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option for per share 
in connection with these sales  we received net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and estimated offering expenses 
net proceeds of million from this offering were used to pay down term loans and revolving loans 
the remaining million was used for general corporate purposes 
on may   we sold  shares of class a common stock in an underwritten public offering for per share 
in connection with these sales  we received net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and estimated offering expenses 
net proceeds of million from this offering were used to pay down term loans and revolving loans 
the remaining million was used for general corporate purposes 
our total potential commitments on our loans  operating leases  intersil incentive payments  royalty and license agreements as of december   were as follows in thousands total within year years years after years on balance sheet commitments senior credit facilities and other long term debt senior subordinated notes convertible subordinated notes total on balance sheet commitments off balance sheet commitments operating leases royalty licensing agreements contingent payments to intersil relating to purchase of malaysian business total off balance sheet commitments total commitments 
table of contents our senior credit facilities  as amended  contain covenants restricting our operations and requiring that we meet specified financial tests 
our financial tests for were as follows a requirement to raise at least million in junior capital by march   which was fulfilled by us through an underwritten public offering of our class a common stock in january and a minimum ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization which is a non gaap term defined in our lending agreement requirement based on a rolling months ending june  and september   of million and million  respectively  with no requirement for december  our actual months ebitda for the period ended september  significantly exceeded the requirement 
beginning with the quarter ended december   the financial covenants will consist solely of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum senior leverage ratio based on a rolling months calculation 
there were no violations of the covenants under our senior credit facilities  as amended  through december  during the quarter ended june   an assessment of approximately billion korean won approximately million us dollars at december   was made by the korean national tax administration  or nta  relating to withholding tax not collected on the loan between our subsidiaries in korea and hungary 
withholding on the transactions in question is not required by the prevailing tax treaty 
there were no further assessments made during the quarter ended december  we have appealed the assessment through the nta s mutual agreement procedure and believe that the assessment will be overturned 
as of december   no accrual has been made 
on july   the icheon tax office of the nta approved a tax suspension of the proposed assessment until resolution of the disputed assessment 
the nta required a corporate guarantee of of the assessment in exchange for the suspension 
we complied with the guarantee request on august  no further assessments have been made 
we believe that our existing cash balances  cash flows from operations and the available borrowings under our senior credit facilities of million will provide sufficient cash resources to meet our projected operating and other cash requirements for the next twelve months 
an event of default under any debt instrument  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may require capital sooner than currently expected 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when we need it or  if available  that it will be available on satisfactory terms 
in addition  the terms of our senior credit facilities and senior subordinated notes significantly reduce our ability to incur additional debt 
failure to obtain any such required additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our company 
other than the covenants on the debt as discussed above  we have no performance guarantees or unconsolidated entities 
our off balance sheet commitments are limited to equipment operating leases  royalty license agreements  leases on office and manufacturing space and additional contingent incentive payments to intersil 
our total off balance sheet obligations are approximately million 
in   and cash provided by used in operations was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash from operations mainly consisted of net income loss plus depreciation and amortization as well as the write down of impaired assets in less utilization for working capital 
in   and cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million  respectively 
in  cash used in investing activities related mainly to net short term investments of million and property and equipment of million 
in  cash used in investing activities mainly was invested in property and equipment 
in  in addition to the acquisition of property and equipment  cash was invested in the purchase of the malaysian business  including purchased intellectual property

acquisition of malaysian business on june   we consummated our acquisition of intersil s packaging and test operations located in kuala lumpur  malaysia along with related intellectual property for approximately million in cash and preferred stock  which was converted into common stock at the time of our initial public offering 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a five year supply agreement with intersil to provide intersil assembly and test services on an exclusive basis 
the terms of the acquisition of the malaysian business require us to pay until june  additional contingent incentive payments to intersil based on the achievement of milestones 
we have recorded these contingent payments as additional purchase price when they are earned 
in the event that intersil was to achieve all the milestones  intersil would receive an additional sum of approximately million in the aggregate 
for the years ended december    and  million  million  and million  respectively  were paid for a cumulative total of million 
these payments increased the effective purchase price and were allocated to non current assets 
additionally  in  million of other purchase price adjustments were recorded based on the difference between the final closing balance sheet and the estimated closing balance sheet of the malaysian business 
as of december   deferred tax of million has been recorded on all of these adjustments 
this resulted in a further increase in non current assets 
there was no goodwill arising from the acquisition of the malaysian business

during the years ended december  and  million and million of these non recurring costs were paid in connection with the reorganization of the factory  product discontinuance and employee related costs 
we began formulating exit plans and termination data during the due diligence relating to the acquisition of the malaysian business 
the accrual was originally comprised of million for involuntary termination benefits and million for other exit activities 
actual involuntary termination benefits and other exit costs amounted to million and million  respectively 
the projected number of planned reductions in head count as a result of this planned restructuring was employees  with an actual reduction of employees 
all restructuring activities were completed in the year ended december  intersil assigned to us patents  copyrights  and technical information used exclusively in or associated with the malaysian business

as a result  capitalized debt issuance costs of million were written off and the expense is included in the year ended december  as an extraordinary item with no comparable results for the same period in there was no tax benefit for the write off because the costs were written off in a tax jurisdiction that provides no such benefit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we have no derivative financial instruments 
we have long term debt that carries fixed and variable interest rates 
a fluctuation in interest rates of would increase our annual interest charge by approximately million 
the exposure to foreign currency gains and losses has been significantly mitigated by the fact that we negotiated with the large majority of our material and equipment suppliers to denominate purchase transactions in us dollars 
for the years ended december   and  we generated approximately   and of total revenue  respectively  from international markets 
in addition  all of the facilities currently used to provide packaging services are located in china  malaysia and south korea 
moreover  many of our customers operations are located in countries outside of the united states of america 
we cannot determine if our future operations and earnings will be affected by new laws  new regulations  a volatile political climate  armed conflicts  changes in or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations or other consequences of doing business outside the united states of america particularly in china  malaysia and south korea 
if future operations are negatively affected by these changes  sales or profits may suffer 
investment and interest risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and short term debt obligations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we have no material cash flow exposure due to rate changes for cash equivalents and short term investments 
our results are only affected by the interest rate changes to variable rate short term borrowings 
due to the short term nature of these borrowings  an immediate change to interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on our results 
our long term bonds bear a fixed interest rate and the interest does not fluctuate with changes in short term or long term rates 

table of contents foreign currency risk based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the value of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
there can be no assurance  however  that there will not be a material impact further in the future 
a portion of our costs is denominated in foreign currencies like the chinese renminbi  the malaysian ringgit and the south korean won 
as a result  changes in the exchange rates of these currencies or any other applicable currencies to the us dollar will affect the cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
we cannot fully predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our profitability 
from time to time  we may have engaged in  and may continue to engage in  exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  we cannot assure that any hedging technique we implement will be effective 
if it is not effective  we may experience reduced operating margins
