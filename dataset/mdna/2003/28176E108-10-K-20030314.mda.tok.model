critical accounting policies and estimates the company s results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the company s accounting policies  as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the company s accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
in evaluating the company s transactions  management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 
management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies 
management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates 
as it relates to the company  estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves  rebate reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  investments in unconsolidated affiliates  workers compensation liabilities  employee benefit related liabilities  deferred tax asset valuation allowances  any impairments of assets  anticipated transactions to be hedged  reserves and contingencies 
these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain  and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates 
management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the financial statements  using historical experience and all available information 
the company also uses outside experts where appropriate 
the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies  which could have the most significant effect on the company s reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
revenue recognition sales are generally recorded when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered  and collection is reasonably assured 
management is required to make judgments about whether or not collectibility is reasonably assured 
for certain products  the company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations 
for these products  revenue is recognized at the time the company is notified that the customer has used the inventory 
the company reduces revenue with reserves for estimated price concessions and sales returns 
allowances  which are recorded at the time revenue is recognized  in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  are based upon historical price concessions and sales returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than the company has anticipated or for customer specific circumstances  such as financial difficulty 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory the company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions 
additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  whereby goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead is subject to a periodic impairment review 
as the company s operations are comprised of one reporting unit  the company reviews the recoverability of its goodwill by comparing the company s fair value to the net book value of its assets 
if the book value of the company s assets exceeds the company s fair value  the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
additionally  management reviews the carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangibles whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
for the purpose of identifying and measuring impairment  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
investments in unconsolidated affiliates investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost method and have been designated as available for sale in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these investments are carried at fair market value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method 
the fair values of certain investments are based on quoted market prices 
for other investments  various methods are used to estimate fair value  including external valuations and discounted cash flows 
when the fair value of a certain investment declines below cost  management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a realized loss the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  the reasons for the decline in market value  and the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
income taxes the company records a liability for potential tax assessments based on its estimate of the potential exposure 
new laws and new interpretations of laws and rulings by tax authorities may affect the liability for potential tax assessments 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues  actual payments or assessments may differ from estimates 
to the extent the company s estimates differ from actual payments or assessments  income tax expense is adjusted 
during  the company resolved certain matters from resulting in a million reduction of its provision for income taxes 
additional information regarding income taxes is included in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million at december  for the majority of its deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards 
the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty of the amounts of net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards that are expected to be realized 
an increase to income would result if the company determines it could utilize more net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards than originally expected 
at the end of each interim reporting period  the company estimates the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned eg  united states compared to non united states as well as tax planning strategies 
if the actual results are different from the company s estimates  adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made

business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net united states dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates

the company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated  but not yet committed  sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  the company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates 
such contracts hedge the united states dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets 
any changes in the carrying value of these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
as part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs  the company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option based products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations

the company utilizes a monte carlo simulation  with a percent confidence level  using spot and three month implied volatilities as stochastic variables and correlations as of the measurement date to estimate this potential loss 
the company s calculated var at december   with a maturity of up to one year  is million 
this amount excludes the potential effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances 
the company s calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur 
actual future gains or losses may differ from and could be significantly greater than these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  and changes in the company s portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods 
in addition  the assumption within the var model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse  which may not be the case 
any loss incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures  there may be currency exchange rate gains or losses in the future
