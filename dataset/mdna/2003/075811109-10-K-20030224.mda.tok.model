historical results and percentage relationships are not necessarily indicative of operating results for any future periods 
overview beckman coulter simplifies and automates laboratory processes used in all phases of the battle against disease 
we design  manufacture and market systems that consist of instruments  chemistries  software and supplies that meet a variety of biomedical laboratory needs 
our products are used in a range of applications  from instruments used for pioneering medical research  clinical trials and drug discovery to diagnostic systems found in hospitals and physicians offices to aid in patient care 
we compete in market segments that we estimate totaled approximately billion in annual sales worldwide in we currently have products that address approximately half of that market 

table of contents our product lines include virtually all blood tests routinely performed in hospital laboratories and a range of systems for medical and pharmaceutical research 
we have more than  systems operating in laboratories around the world  with approximately of revenues coming from after market customer purchases of operating supplies  chemistry kits and service 
we market our products in more than countries  with approximately of revenues in coming from sales outside the united states 
our strategy is to expand our position as a leading provider of laboratory systems 
to this end  we achieved the following significant milestones in announced an alliance with ciphergen biosystems  inc to automate clinical proteomics research 
shipped the cytomics fc system  a dual laser  five color flow cytometer for the cell based research market 
introduced and shipped the ceq genetic analysis system  which performs a wide variety of dna related tests 
signed four supply agreements worth a total of million over months with premier  inc  one of the largest group purchasing organizations in the united states 
shipped the synchron lx pro clinical system with closed tube sampling  improving safety in the laboratory 
shipped the avanti j e centrifuge  a compact  general purpose system for bioseparations 
shipped the vi cell cell viability analyzer  which automates monitoring of viable cells during the manufacturing stage of the recombinant dna process 
signed licensing and supply agreement with eprogen  inc to become the exclusive distributor of the proteosep trademark of eprogen  inc consumables and software platform  an important technology for automating protein research 
shipped the optima l xp ultracentrifuge system  used for the preparation and separation applications in cytomics  genomics and proteomics 
unveiled plans for a nanoliter liquid transfer platform for low volume liquid handling 
signed a million  five year clinical chemistry product agreement with the magnet group purchasing organization 
announced commercialization of class ii mhc tetramer reagents used to detect diseases such as type i diabetes  rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis 
shipped the synchron lx i clinical system  a closed tube sampling workstation offering more than immunodiagnostic and routine chemistry tests 
acquired snp genotyping system from orchid biosciences  inc in  we realigned the company into three divisions clinical diagnostics  life science research and specialty testing 
accordingly  certain prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the new three divisional structure 
during  we continued to evaluate opportunities to leverage our competencies in flow cytometry  immune testing  robotic automation and dna analysis in faster growing market niches  such as clinical research 
in the process  we determined that there were potential synergies between the life science research and specialty testing divisions 
this conclusion lead us to consolidate the life science research and specialty testing divisions into a single biomedical research division  which was formed in early revised segment reporting will begin in the first quarter of when the two division organization takes effect 

table of contents results of operations compared with sales were  million in  an increase of compared to  million in on a constant currency basis sales increased in the following provides key product and geographical sales information for dollar amounts in millions constant reported currency sales sales growth growth key product sales routine chemistry immunodiagnostics total chemistry hematology total clinical diagnostics robotic automation genetic analysis centrifuge analytical systems total life science research total specialty testing total constant reported currency sales sales growth growth geographical sales americas united states canada and latin america europe asia total constant currency growth is not a gaap defined measure of revenue growth 
constant currency growth as presented herein represents current year constant currency sales see below less prior year reported sales prior year reported sales we define constant currency sales as current year sales in local currency translated to us dollars at the prior year s foreign currency exchange rate 
this measure provides information on sales growth assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior year and the current year 
constant currency sales and constant currency growth as defined or presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
additionally  constant currency sales is not an alternative measure of revenues on a gaap basis 
sales growth during was affected by the following clinical diagnostics sales increases during were led by immunodiagnostics sales growth in access immunoassay products  including such tests as the new accutni cardiac assay 
routine 
table of contents chemistry sales improved primarily due to higher synchron clinical system placements 
hematology sales improved due to sales of the coulter lh hematology instrument 
life science research and specialty testing sales were negatively impacted by a slow down in pharmaceutical and biotechnology investment and modest academic research spending 
however  the ceq series of genetic analysis systems for dna sequencing continues to enjoy market acceptance  particularly in the mid market segment 
specialty testing sales were impacted by the market conditions discussed above 
nevertheless  our new cytomics fc flow cytometer for the cell based research market released in  has been well received 
gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin in was  percentage points lower than in on a constant currency basis  gross margin was  percentage points lower than the prior year 
the decrease in margin is mainly due to the following an unfavorable product mix  whereby more of our lower margin generating products were sold during the year  especially in the life science research division 
this resulted in about a percentage point impact 
competitive pricing in certain european markets resulted in about a percentage point impact 
certain inventory adjustments resulting from a reconciliation of our intercompany accounts during a system conversion 
this reconciliation impacted gross margin by about percentage points 
negative economic conditions in latin america  which impacted gross margin by about percentage points 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased million to million or of sales in from million or of sales in the prior year 
the following factors impacted sg a during the year ended december  a reversal of a million accrual associated with a cross licensing  and million of amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets that was not recorded during the year ended december   pursuant to the adoption of sfas excluding the above items  sg a in would have been million  or of sales  percentage points higher than in the improvement in sg a as a percentage of sales between and is due to cost reduction initiatives and only partial employee bonus targets being achieved relative to research and development r d expenses decreased million to million in from million in r d as a percentage of sales was in  compared to in  a percentage point decrease 
the decrease is due to several development projects moving into the commercialization phase and  similar to above  only partial employee bonus targets being achieved relative to during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain of million as a result of a curtailment of a postretirement plan  whereby employees who had not met certain age and service requirements as of december  are no longer eligible to receive medical coverage upon retirement 
also during  there was a million increase in our pension expense which is due  in part  to a lower discount rate and a lower market value on plan assets see note retirement benefits 
these items impact cost of sales  sg a and r d 
during  we recorded a million litigation charge for a patent infringement settlement with streck laboratories  inc and related expenses 
see note commitments and contingencies for further discussion 

table of contents interest expense declined million to million in compared to million in primarily due to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates on the variable portion of our borrowings 
other non operating income expense was million in and primarily consisted of foreign currency related activities of million  a write down of million resulting from a reduction in the fair value of a biotechnology equity investment and gains on the sales of certain receivables of million 
other non operating income expense was million in and primarily consisted of foreign currency related activities of million  a write down of million for an equity investment in a company that performs point of care testing and gains on the sales of certain sales type lease receivables of million 
interest income increased million to million in from million in income tax expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  income tax as a percentage of pretax income was for the year compared to for the year  a decrease of percentage points 
the decrease was primarily due to deductions related to export sales and r d tax credits and the tax effects resulting from the streck laboratories  inc litigation settlement 
net earnings were million in or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share for net earnings for the year were million or per diluted share before the accounting change see note nature of business and summary of significant accounting policies for further discussion 
as indicated in note business segment information  we had three reportable segments during and two reportable segments during and all corporate activities are captured in a central service center  including costs incurred at the corporate level which significantly benefit the operations of each segment 
because these segment related costs remain in the center  a discussion of our operating profit by segment is not meaningful 
compared with sales were  million in  an increase of compared to  million in the following provides key product and geographical sales information for dollar amounts in millions reported sales sales growth key product sales routine chemistry immunodiagnostics total chemistry hematology total clinical diagnostics robotic automation genetic analysis centrifuge analytical systems total life science research total specialty testing total 
table of contents reported sales sales growth geographical sales americas united states canada and latin america europe asia total sales growth during was affected by the following routine chemistry sales increases were primarily due to placements of our new synchron lx pro clinical systems 
immunodiagnostics sales increases were primarily due to the combination of shipments of our new access immunoassay system  shipments of our newly fda cleared access accutni tm troponin i cardiac test and other access immunoassay product sales 
hematology sales increases were primarily due  in part  to shipments of the new coulter lh instrument 
life science research sales increases were primarily due to sales of the biomek fx laboratory automation workstation 
improved sales in the americas were led by robotic automation genetic analysis  routine chemistry and immunodiagnostics products  while improved sales in europe and asia were due to strong sales of robotic automation genetic analysis and immunodiagnostics products 
gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin in was  percentage points lower than the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin was due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rates  which resulted in a gross profit decrease of approximately million  or percentage points 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million to million or of sales in from million or of sales in the prior year 
the improvement in sg a as a percentage of sales is primarily due to a million reversal of an accrual associated with a cross licensing agreement during excluding this accrual reversal  sg a as a percentage of sales would have been in  consistent with the prior year 
research and development r d expenses increased million to million in from million in the increase is primarily due to increased r d expenses associated with our immunomics operation 
r d as a percentage of sales was in  compared to in in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to certain reorganization activities in europe 
in the fourth quarters of and  we reversed million and million  respectively  of excess restructure charges taken in prior years 
these charges and reversals resulted in net restructuring credits of million and million in and  respectively 
interest income increased million to million in from million in interest expense declined million to million in compared to million in primarily due to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates on the variable portion of our borrowings 
other non operating income expense was million in and primarily consisted of foreign currency related activities of million  a write down of million for an equity investment in a company that performs point of care testing and gains on the sales of certain sales type lease receivables of 
table of contents million 
other non operating income expense was million in and primarily consisted of foreign currency related activities of million  a gain on the sale of a facility in japan of million and a gain on the sale of a facility in australia of million 
earnings before the accounting change associated with the adoption of sfas see note nature of business and summary of significant accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements in were million or per diluted share as compared to million or per diluted share in net earnings were million or per diluted share as compared to million or per diluted share in financial condition liquidity and capital resources liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing and to convert those assets that are no longer required to meet existing strategic and financing objectives into cash 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current and potentially available funds for use in achieving long range business objectives and meeting debt service commitments 
currently  our liquidity needs arise primarily from debt service on indebtedness  working capital requirements  and capital expenditures 
cash flows provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash flows provided by operating activities increased by million between and primarily due to changes in working capital of million  which includes trade and other receivables  inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the net improvement is primarily due to lower days sales outstanding of approximately days during versus days during as a result of improved focus and efforts to collect outstanding accounts 
days sales outstanding is calculated using average accounts receivables for the quarter and the quarterly sales amount times four  and an improvement in inventory turns to times in versus times in due to management s efforts to control inventory levels 
inventory turns is calculated using net ending inventory and a rolling four quarter cost of sales 
the working capital change was offset by cash payments of million due to the streck patent infringement settlement and related expenses and cash contributions of million to our us defined benefit pension plans in cash flows provided by operating activities increased by million between and primarily due to changes in working capital of million  which includes trade and other receivables  inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the improvement is primarily due to changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  which is primarily due to an increased accounts payable balance at december  associated with higher inventory levels  offset by changes in trade and other receivables of million due to increased sales activity during the fourth quarter of versus the fourth quarter of 
table of contents changes in other operating assets and liabilities also contributed an additional million to the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities between and investing activities used million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease between and is primarily due to decreases in capital expenditures associated with our implementation of an oracle enterprise resource planning system erp see below for discussion 
the increase between and is primarily due to increases in capital expenditures associated with our implementation of the erp system and lower proceeds received from the sale of certain clinical chemistry assets in spain 
financing activities used million  million and million of cash flows in  and  respectively 
net cash paid to reduce our bank and other debt amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additionally  we paid million  million and million in dividends to our stockholders in  and  respectively 
these amounts were partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of stock of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in we used million to purchase shares in the company s stock to be held in the grantor trust to support our executive deferred compensation plans and used an additional million to purchase shares to be held in treasury see below 
we have chosen to implement an erp system to achieve a single  globally integrated infrastructure 
this includes functionality for finance  human resources  supply chain  order management  sales and service to replace or complement existing legacy systems and business processes 
through december   we have capitalized million of costs associated with this erp system which includes million of capitalized internal labor costs 
based on our geographic rollout strategy  as of december   we have essentially implemented functionality for finance  human resources and certain purchasing systems for our global operations except japan 
sales functionality has been implemented on a limited integration basis for our us and canadian operations 
we expect that the majority of the work required to implement the remaining new systems will take place through if we are unable to implement and effectively manage the transition to these new systems  our future consolidated operating results could be adversely affected 
based upon current levels of operations and expected future growth  we believe our cash flows from operations together with available borrowings under our new credit facility which we entered into in july see note debt financing of the consolidated financial statements and other sources of liquidity including leases and any other available financing sources will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for interest payments and other debt service obligations  working capital  capital expenditures  lease payments  pension contributions and other operating needs 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that estimated cost savings or growth can be achieved 
future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance existing indebtedness  will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in july  we terminated our million credit facility and as noted above entered into a new credit facility the million credit facility 
the million credit facility  which is unsecured  enables us to borrow up to million and can be increased up to million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  matures in july and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments 
borrowings under the million credit facility generally bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based upon our senior unsecured debt rating 
we must also pay a quarterly facility fee of per annum on the undrawn million credit facility commitment 
no amounts were drawn on the million credit facility or the terminated credit facility at december  and 
table of contents our long term debt consists of the following at december  and dollar amounts in millions average rate of interest senior notes  unsecured  due senior notes  unsecured  due senior notes  unsecured  due debentures  unsecured  due other long term debt the million of unsecured senior notes are due march  we will repay these notes entirely upon maturity through operating cash flows and or our million credit facility see note debt financing of the consolidated financial statements 
in october  our company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock to pre fund our stock based employee benefit programs 
the stock repurchase program is authorized to continue for the next three years 
during the quarter ended december   we repurchased million shares 
in october  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission 
once effective  the shelf registration statement gives us the ability to offer and sell up to million of securities  which may include debt securities  preferred stock  common stock and warrants to purchase debt securities  common stock  preferred stock or depository shares 
the issuance of any such securities could represent new financing or could be used to pay down existing debt 
we have no immediate plans to offer or sell any securities 
the following represents a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments in millions payments due by period total thereafter long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations the million debentures due include a feature that could require repayment in see note debt financing 
accordingly  the million has been included within the million amount above 
subsequent event during the quarter ending march   we intend on recording a restructuring charge of approximately million associated with the elimination of about positions worldwide  or approximately of our workforce 
about two thirds of these eliminations will be in the united states and one third in other locations 
critical accounting policies the us securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding in their calls on judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
we are not aware of any reasonably possible events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being reported 
table of contents that would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  including customer leased equipment for products  revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured  except when a customer enters into an operating type lease agreement  in which case revenue is recognized over the life of the lease 
under a sales type lease agreement  revenue is recognized at the time of shipment with interest income recognized over the life of the lease 
service revenues on maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the life of the service agreement or as service is performed  if not under contract 
for those equipment sales which include other obligations  such as providing after market supplies or service  we allocate revenue based on the relative fair values of the individual components as determined by cash sales prices  unless the deliverable is incidental or perfunctory in which case we accrue an estimate of the related cost 
credit is extended based upon the evaluation of the customer s financial condition and we generally do not require collateral 
reserves for doubtful accounts we maintain reserves for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these reserves are determined by analyzing specific customer accounts that have known or potential collection issues and applying historical loss rates to the aging of the remaining accounts receivable balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required 
inventory adjustments for write down of inventories to fair value inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method of determining inventory costs 
inventory schedules are regularly analyzed by finance and logistics personnel  and where necessary  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
a significant increase in the forecasted demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in forecasted demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand requiring additional inventory write downs 
determination of useful lives and assessments of impairment for identifiable intangibles  including goodwill intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on the expected number of years the asset will generate revenue 
on january   we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or change in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  impairment is tested by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the fair value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned 
for goodwill  a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill 
see note nature of business and summary of significant accounting policies for further discussion 

table of contents environmental obligations we establish provisions for exposure related to environmental and legal matters 
our compliance with federal  state and foreign environmental laws and regulations may require us to remove or mitigate the effects of the disposal or release of chemical substances in jurisdictions where we do business or maintain properties 
we establish reserves when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
provision amounts are estimated based on currently available information  regulatory requirements  remediation strategies  our relative share of the total remediation costs and a relevant discount rate 
changes in these assumptions could impact our future reported results 
legal obligations we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which we consider to be normal for our type of business operations 
as a global company active in a wide range of life sciences and chemical activities  we may  in the normal course of our business become involved in proceedings relating to matters such as patent validity and infringement disputes related to intellectual property  contractual obligations  and employment matters 
we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any proceedings in which we are or may become involved 
an adverse decision in a lawsuit seeking damages from us could result in a monetary award to the plaintiff and  to the extent not covered by our insurance policies or third party indemnities  could significantly harm the results of our operations 
an adverse decision in a lawsuit seeking an injunction or other similar relief could significantly harm our business operations 
if we lose a case in which we seek to enforce our patent rights  we could sustain a loss of future revenue as other manufacturers begin to market products we developed 
litigation cases and claims raise difficult and complex legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities  including  but not limited to  the facts and circumstances of each particular case and claim  the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought  and differences in applicable law 
upon resolution of any pending legal matters  we may incur charges in excess of presently established provisions and related insurance or third party coverage 
it is possible that our results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable outcome of certain pending litigation 
although we believe that our provisions are appropriate  and in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies  changes in events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  profitability or liquidity 
tax valuation allowances and obligations we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  which prescribes an asset and liability approach 
under the asset and liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than not 
uncertainties exist in respect to our future tax rates due to uncertainties as to the amount and timing of future taxable income and changes in enacted statutory tax rates 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  could result in adjustments to tax expense in future periods 
pension plans our funding policy provides that payments to our domestic pension trusts shall at least be equal to the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for pensions  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption as to the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the 
table of contents funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
we view this assumption as a long term return assumption 
this assumption is reviewed at least annually 
our review of this long term return assumption is done in conjunction with our pension plan investment advisors and our actuaries 
we also review the plan s historical cumulative returns 
the rate of return is dependent upon an investment strategy and the asset allocation of plan assets 
we then review the selected prospective return rate against benchmark information that we gather on other pension plans adjusting for relative size  investment strategies and funding levels 
since this is a long term return assumption  it is likely to change when there are long protracted trends in equity  bond and real estate markets 
while our plan s historical return performance is no absolute predictor of future performance  it is indicative of what our plan s rate of return could be in the future 
we believe this historical performance is a fair approximation of what our pension plan s rate of return can achieve over a variety of market conditions 
over the long run  given our us pension plan s current funded condition  a decrease in the annual rate of return assumption would generate approximately million in additional annual pension expense 
this additional expense would be allocated to all operating line items based upon the relative salaries included in each line 
similarly  a increase in the rate of return assumption would decrease our annual pension expense by approximately million with similar effects to the statement of operations 
there had been no changes to this assumption in the past three years because our historical cumulative us pension plan rate of return has exceeded our return rate assumption through however  in  we lowered our prospective return rate assumption to from 
this action was taken after our annual review of our cumulative pension plan returns and consultation and discussions with our pension plan investment and actuary advisors 
we believe our new rate of return assumption is reasonable based on our long term investment strategy and allocation of our plan assets  which at december  had an allocation as follows equities  corporate bonds and real estate 
we will consider reducing or increasing the rate of return in the future if sustained us pension plan returns change significantly and if the market and peer pension plan information indicate a different rate is more indicative of expected long term returns 
pension benefits for domestic employees are based on age  years of service and compensation rate 
assets of the plans consist principally of corporate stocks and bonds  real estate and government fixed income securities 
non us subsidiaries have separate pension plan arrangements  which include both funded and unfunded plans 
unfunded non us plans are accrued for  but generally not fully funded  and benefits are paid from operating funds 
we use a combination of historical results and anticipated future events to estimate and make assumptions relating to our critical accounting policies 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
financial risk management our risk management program  developed by senior management and approved by the board of directors  seeks to minimize the potentially negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates on the results of operations 
our primary exposures to fluctuations in the financial markets are to changes in foreign exchange risk and interest rates 
foreign exchange risk arises because our reporting currency is the us dollar and we generate approximately of our revenues in various foreign currencies 
us dollar denominated costs and expenses as a percentage of total operating costs and expenses are much greater than us dollar denominated sales as a percentage of total net sales 
as a result  appreciation of the us dollar against our major trading currencies has a negative impact on our results of operations  and depreciation of the us dollar against such currencies has a positive impact 
we seek to minimize our exposure to changes in exchange rates by denominating costs and expenses in foreign currencies 
when these opportunities are exhausted  we use derivative financial instruments to function as hedges 
we use forward contracts  purchased option contracts and complex option contracts consisting of purchased and sold options  to hedge certain foreign currency denominated transactions 
we do not use these instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises out of our long term debt obligations 
under the guidance of our risk management policies  we use derivative contracts on certain borrowing transactions 
with the aid of these 
table of contents contracts  we seek to reduce the negative effects of changes in interest rates by changing the character of the interest rate on our long term debt  converting a fixed rate to a variable rate and vice versa 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge our investment portfolio  which consists of short term investments maturity of less than a year 
inflation we continually monitor inflation and the effects of changing prices 
inflation increases the cost of goods and services used 
competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets restrict our ability to fully recover the higher costs of acquired goods and services through price increases 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of inflation by implementing continuous process improvement solutions to enhance productivity and efficiency and  as a result  lower costs and operating expenses 
the effects of inflation have  in our opinion  been managed appropriately and as a result have not had a material impact on our operations and the resulting financial position or liquidity 
euro the new european currency the countries of the european union have adopted a single currency  the euro 
the euro came into existence on january   and on january   became the only currency in economic and monetary union countries 
a significant portion of our business is conducted in europe 
the introduction of the euro required that we make modifications to our internal operations as well as to our external business arrangements 
these changes were completed and we adopted the euro for internal systems and reporting as of december  the adoption of the euro did not have a material effect on our business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
recent accounting developments revenue recognition and multiple deliverables in november  the emerging issues task force eitf finalized its consensus on eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which provides guidance on the timing and method of revenue recognition for sales arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service 
eitf is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  under eitf  revenue must be allocated to all deliverables regardless of whether an individual element is incidental or perfunctory 
certain of our sales arrangements include undelivered elements that we have historically considered incidental and perfunctory 
consequently  we have not deferred revenue related to these elements and have instead recorded an accrual for the estimated cost of providing them 
we are currently analyzing the impact of the adoption of eitf on our financial statements 
accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
we are required to adopt sfas on january  the adoption of sfas did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
rescissions  amendment and technical corrections of certain sfas s sfas rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections eliminates sfas and sfas  as it amends sfas  which requires gains and losses from extinguishments of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  and thus  also the exception to applying opinion is eliminated as well 
this statement is effective for years beginning after may for the provisions related to the rescission of sfas and  and for all transactions entered into beginning may for the provision related to the amendment of statement we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 

table of contents exit or disposal activities sfas accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between this statement and eitf relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for exit costs as defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  there is no significant impact of this statement on our financial statements 
business climate the clinical diagnostics  specialty testing and life science research markets are highly competitive with many manufacturers around the world and are subject to certain business risks 
in addition  these markets are impacted by global economic and political conditions 
in particular  government policies regarding reimbursement for health care costs and the approval of and reimbursement for new therapeutics have a significant impact on investment by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and hospitals 
future profitability may also be adversely affected if the relative value of the us dollar strengthens against certain currencies 
clinical diagnostics the clinical diagnostics market can be unfavorably impacted by economic weakness and government and healthcare cost containment initiatives in general 
in particular  the weakness in these markets as well as general economic conditions have affected the availability of funds for capital expenditures 
in addition  attempts to lower costs and to increase productivity have led to further consolidation among healthcare providers in the united states  resulting in more powerful provider groups that continue to leverage their purchasing power to contain costs 
preferred supplier arrangements and combined purchases are becoming more commonplace 
consequently  it has become essential for manufacturers to provide cost effective diagnostic systems to remain competitive 
cost containment initiatives in the united states and in the european healthcare systems will continue to be factors which may affect our ability to maintain or increase sales 
the continuing consolidation trend among united states healthcare providers has increased pressure on diagnostic equipment manufacturers to broaden their product offerings to encompass a wider range of testing capability  greater automation and higher volume capacity at a lower cost 
in the us hospital market  the primary focus of beckman coulter s diagnostic business  funding is better than it has been in several years but could be impacted by current economic conditions 
in addition  as labor shortages continue to be an issue in clinical laboratories  our automated systems are helping to fill the void 
with our leadership position in cellular analysis and our extensive capabilities in routine chemistry and immunodiagnostics  we are able to offer a broad range of automated systems that together can perform more than of a hospital laboratory s testing needs and essentially of the blood tests that are considered routine 
we believe we are able to provide significant value added benefits  enhanced through our expertise in simplifying and automating laboratory processes  to our customers 
life science research the life science research market has been growing in recent years as an increasing understanding of genomics  cytomics  and proteomics has begun to move from scientific research toward having a real impact on clinical therapy 
however  spending in this market also continues to be affected by governmental 
table of contents constraints on research and development spending  especially outside the united states  and pharmaceutical bioresearch capital investment 
while us supported research has been positive in recent years  it is subject to yearly approval by congress and continued increases in funding is not guaranteed 
spending also may be negatively impacted by a prolonged recession  attempts to contain government spending in order to balance the budget and reduce deficit spending  or the need to make funds available for other programs 
even when funds are available  they may be used for other purposes 
for example  while the national institutes of health funding was increased by in  funding went into infrastructure at the expense of capital equipment purchases 
spending on research by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies is also dependent on global economic health 
an ongoing recession can affect the number of biotechnology start ups building laboratories and conducting research as well as the rate of research investment by biopharmaceutical companies 
pharmaceutical company research investment may also be negatively impacted by governmental intervention and regulations  including prescription drug costs  new drug approvals  switching of prescription drugs to generics  as well as industry consolidation 
we believe that a recovery in capital spending in these markets may not occur until the end of  with the pharmaceutical market recovering before the biotechnology market 
longer term  we continue to see tight pharmaceutical and biotechnology discovery spending 
spending now appears to be moving from drug discovery into drug development  as pharmaceutical companies focus on bringing new products to market  faster 
however  we believe this move opens new opportunities for robotic automation systems and in clinical research and clinical trial applications 
specialty testing in the specialty testing market  the long term outlook is positive with an increasing need for applications in the areas of clinical research and clinical trials 
however  this market is tied in many ways to developments in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets and slowdowns in spending in these markets will ultimately affect the specialty testing market as well 
many of the same dynamics of the life science research market affect specialty testing 
other factors our new products originate from four sources internal research and development programs  external collaborative efforts with individuals in academic institutions and technology companies  devices or techniques that are generated in customers laboratories  and business and technology acquisitions 
the size and growth of our markets are influenced by a number of factors  including technological innovation in bioanalytical practice  government funding for basic and disease related research for example  heart disease  aids and cancer  research and development spending by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  healthcare spending  and physician practice patterns 

table of contents we expect worldwide healthcare expenditures and diagnostic testing to increase over the long term  primarily as a result of the following growing demand for services generated by the increasing size and aging of the world population  increasing expenditures on diseases requiring costly or extended treatment for example  aids and cancer  and expanding demand for improved healthcare services in developing countries 
in addition to the business climate factors discussed previously  certain economic factors may influence our business currency fluctuations as approximately of our revenues in were generated outside the united states  and given the recent fluctuations in foreign currencies  we may experience volatility in sales  operating income and other non operating income and expense  interest rates as approximately of our debt at december  is under variable interest rate terms 
this percentage includes the effect of our reverse interest rate swap derivatives which change the character of the interest rate on certain of our long term debt by effectively converting a fixed rate to a variable rate  and general economic conditions as the weakened global economy has pressured our customers  vendors and partners  the carrying value of various assets could be negatively impacted in future periods 
this would include  but is not limited to  the various pension plan and post employment benefit assets and liabilities 
assumptions are used in determining the annual expense of these costs 
items such as the market value of plan assets  discount rates and other assumptions are based on current economic conditions 
certain other assumptions are based upon a longer term economic view 
we review and discuss these assumptions annually as to their reasonableness with our independent actuary and investment consultants 
we believe that the assumptions we have used are reasonable 
however  these assumptions are subject to change with future economic conditions and as such our annual benefits expense may vary 
income taxes we are subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world 
our effective tax rate and income tax liabilities will be affected by a number of factors  such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions  the tax rates in particular jurisdictions  tax treaties between jurisdictions  the extent to which income is repatriated  and future changes in the law 
generally  our income tax liability in a particular jurisdiction is determined either on an entity by entity non consolidated basis or on a consolidated basis including only those entities incorporated in the same jurisdiction 
in those jurisdictions where consolidated tax reporting is not permitted  we may pay income taxes even though  on an overall basis  we may have incurred a net loss for the tax year 

table of contents forward looking statements this annual report contains forward looking statements  including statements regarding  among other items the schedule for completion of our erp program  anticipated benefits from consolidation of our life science research and specialty testing divisions into a single  biomedical research division  anticipated debt reduction  cash flow available to be applied to debt reduction and the availability of additional financing  our business strategy and anticipated developments in our markets  our liquidity requirements and capital resources  adequacy of our reserves and the effects of litigation  anticipated proceeds from sales of assets  the effects of inflation and other economic conditions on our operations  and earnings and sales growth 
these forward looking statements are based on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to unanticipated delays in completing our erp program  complexity and uncertainty regarding development of new high technology products  loss of market share through aggressive competition in the clinical diagnostic  life science research and specialty testing markets  our dependence on capital spending policies and government funding  the effects of potential healthcare reforms  changes in estimates associated with the adoption of sfas  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates  reliance on patents and other intellectual property  global economic and political conditions  unanticipated reductions in cash flows and difficulty in sales of assets  future effective tax rates  and other factors that cannot be identified at this time 
although we believe we have the product offerings and resources required to achieve our objectives  actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements 
there can be no assurance that events anticipated by these forward looking statements will in fact transpire as expected 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities and exchange commission requires that registrants include information about potential effects of changes in currency exchange and interest rates in their form k filings 
several alternatives  all with some limitations  have been offered 
the following discussion is based on a sensitivity analysis  which models the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
this analysis is constrained by several factors  including the following it is based on a single point in time  and it does not include the effects of other complex market reactions that would arise from the changes modeled 
although the results of the analysis may be useful as a benchmark  they should not be viewed as forecasts 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  mexican peso and the australian dollar 
as of december  and  the net fair value of all derivative foreign exchange contracts was a net liability asset of million and million  respectively 
we estimated the sensitivity of the fair value of all derivative foreign exchange contracts to a hypothetical strengthening and weakening of the spot exchange rates for the us dollar against the foreign currencies at december  the analysis showed that a strengthening of the us dollar would result in a gain from a fair value change of million and a weakening of the us dollar would result in a loss from a fair value change of million in these instruments 
losses and gains on the underlying transactions being hedged would largely offset any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 
significant foreign currency exposures at december  were not significantly different than those at december  similarly  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our variable rate debt instruments and derivatives 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates was estimated to decrease or increase next year s pre tax earnings by million based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at december  a comparable analysis at december  indicated that a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates was estimated to decrease or increase pretax earnings by million based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at december  the increase in the sensitivity analysis of million between and is due to the increases in our debt under variable interest rate terms including the effect of our reverse interest rate swap derivatives which change the character of the interest rate on our long term debt by effectively converting a fixed rate to a variable rate 
additional information with respect to our foreign currency and interest rate exposures are discussed in note derivatives of the consolidated financial statements
