item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see index to financial statements beginning at page f overview 
we are an integrated eye care services company focused on vision benefits management managed vision  the distribution of products and software services to eye care professionals  and consumer vision services  which includes retail optical sales and eye care services to patients 
in may  our board of directors approved management s plan to dispose of substantially all of the net assets relating to our retail optometry operations in north carolina 
the sale was completed in august and was accounted for as a discontinued operation 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we modified our strategic vision and realigned our business into the following three reportable operating segments managed vision  consumer vision  and distribution technology 
our managed vision division contracts with insurers  managed care plans and other third party payers to manage claims payment administration of eye health benefits for contracting parties 
our consumer vision division sells retail optical products to consumers and operates integrated eye health centers and surgical facilities in connecticut where comprehensive eye care services are provided to patients 
our distribution technology division provides products and services to eye care professionals ophthalmologists  optometrists and opticians 
this division operates a buying group program for optical and ophthalmic goods and medical supplies  and develops and sells technology systems and software to eye care professionals 
in addition to these divisions  we receive income from other non core operations and transactions  including our health service organization hso operation which receives fee income for providing certain support services to individual ophthalmology and optometry practices 
while we continue to provide the obligatory services to these practices  we are in the process of generally disengaging from a number of these operations 
see legal proceedings health services organization lawsuits as a result of the sale of our retail optometry division in north carolina and the realignment of our business into these three reportable operating segments  historical amounts previously reported have been restated to reflect discontinued operations treatment and to conform to our current operating segment presentation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
services revenue through our affiliated professional corporation  our consumer vision division provides to consumers comprehensive eye care services  including medical and surgical treatment of eye diseases and disorders by ophthalmologists  and vision measuring and non surgical treatments and correction services by optometrists 
we charge a fee for providing the use of our ambulatory surgery center to professionals for surgical procedures 
our ophthalmic  optometric and ambulatory surgery center services are recorded at established rates  reduced by an estimate for contractual allowances and doubtful accounts 
contractual allowances arise due to the terms of certain reimbursement contracts with third party payers that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates 
the contractual allowance represents the difference between the charges at established rates and estimated recoverable amounts and is recognized in the period the services are rendered 
the contractual allowance recorded is estimated based on an analysis of collection experience in relation to amounts billed and other relevant information 
any differences between estimated contractual adjustments and actual final settlements under reimbursement contracts are recognized as contractual adjustments in the period of final settlements 
medical claims expense claims expense is recorded as provider services are rendered and includes an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
reserves for estimated insurance losses are determined on a case by case basis for reported claims  and on estimates based on our experience for loss adjustment expenses and incurred but not reported claims 
these liabilities give effect to trends in claims severity and other factors which may vary as the losses are ultimately settled 
we believe that our estimates of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable  however  there is considerable variability inherent in the reserve estimates 
these estimates are continually reviewed and  as adjustments to these liabilities become necessary  such adjustments are reflected in current operations in the period of the adjustment 
goodwill goodwill  which arises from the purchase price exceeding the assigned value of net assets of acquired businesses  represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired 
of the total goodwill included on our consolidated balance sheet  approximately is recorded in our managed vision segment  in our consumer vision segment and in our distribution technology segment 
on an annual basis  or as circumstances dictate  management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying value 
the evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex  and involves significant management judgement in the use of estimates and assumptions 
we use multiples of revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of comparable entities to value the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment 
we evaluate impairment using a two step process 
first  we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit  as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value 
events that may indicate goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in business or economic climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  and the sale or expected sale disposal of a reporting unit 
due to uncertain market conditions it is possible that that the financial information used to support our goodwill may change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes which requires an asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
our determination of the likelihood that deferred tax assets can be realized is based on our examination of available evidence  which involves estimates and assumptions 
we consider future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income and known future events in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  managed vision revenue 
managed vision revenue represents fees received under our managed care contracts

product sales revenue decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
of this decrease  million represents a decrease in buying group revenue and million represents a decrease in retail optical revenue resulting from a decrease in purchasing volume 
the decrease in buying group volume is primarily due to consolidation in the eye care industry whereby smaller independent eye care businesses are being replaced by larger eye care chains that purchase directly from vendors 
we expect this shift to continue and potentially further reduce the buying group s market share and revenue  however  we do not expect this trend to have a material impact on our overall profitability

our revenue stream from fees collected under our health service organization agreements has been decreasing due to disputes with certain physician practices which are parties to these agreements 
we are in litigation with several of these practices and intend to continue to pursue settlement of these matters in the future 
while a continued decrease in these contractual fees could negatively impact our cash flows  we are currently focusing on resolving the disputes with these practices and believe we will receive cash payments and or other consideration in settlement of these disputes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing activities under our credit facility with capitalsource  due to its variable interest rate 
the nature and amount of our indebtedness may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the extent of our interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable due to the variability of future interest rates and financing needs 
we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in the year  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 
a change in the interest rate payable by us on our variable rate debt would have increased or decreased the annual interest expense by million  assuming our borrowing level is unchanged 
we did not use derivative instruments to adjust our interest rate risk profile during the year ended december
