over the past two years  the company has experienced a continued decline in transactional financial printing revenue as the result of the capital market downturn 
total transactional revenues in were the lowest in seven years 
despite this downturn  the company continues to maintain its industry leading market share in both the domestic and international markets

selling and administrative expenses decreased  or  to  primarily as a result of cost reductions implemented during the year  including realizing the full effect of the workforce reductions during the second and fourth quarters of the decrease was also the result of lower expenses that are directly associated with sales such as selling expenses including commissions and bonuses and certain variable administrative expenses 
as a percent of sales  selling and administrative expenses increased by approximately two percentage points to 
this increase is primarily the result of lower revenues available to absorb certain fixed selling and administrative expenses

outsourcing revenue increased  or  to  for the year ended december  the slight increase is attributed to both the acquisition of dms in april and the acquisition of decisionquest in december other revenue was down slightly compared to the prior year  as volume growth on existing client contracts and new customers was more than offset by decreased revenue from certain existing customers due to the sustained downturn in the capital markets  as well as lost revenue from former customers who have gone out of business or are in bankruptcy 
the outsourcing segment provides a full array of outsourcing services in information technology  document processing services  creative services  litigation support services  and office document services  primarily to the legal  investment banking and financial services industries 
services are contractual and  therefore  help provide a means to manage business volatility more effectively 
declining volumes can be offset somewhat through monthly minimum charges on certain contracts  as well as contract language that calls for the removal of underutilized assets such as copier machines

the company anticipates increased revenue in as a result of the globalnet acquisition as well as through organic growth 
gross margin from this segment was nearly flat at  while the gross margin percentage decreased approximately eight percentage points to 
lower than expected revenue growth on a higher fixed cost base  resulting from the mendez acquisition  is the principal cause of the margin decline 
the company has attempted to align its resource levels with the lower level of revenue  but because of restrictive labor laws in most european countries  where the majority of bgs employees work  this process took most of the year 
in addition  constant price pressure throughout the industry has eroded margins 
the company anticipates margin improvement as it continues to merge redundant facilities and further integrates bgs s workforce with that of globalnet

table of contents outlook the following statements and certain statements made elsewhere in this document are based upon current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
current trends in the global economy  particularly in the domestic and international capital markets  compounded by world events in general  make it difficult at present to project future activity also refer to the first two paragraphs of this item 
during  the company expects improved results over our comparable results 
the results of our financial print business will continue to be impacted by the anticipated softness in the capital markets  both domestically and internationally 
we expect improvement at both bbs and bgs as we integrate recent acquisitions into existing operations 
although several circumstances  including volatile market conditions  have limited the company s ability to predict future financial results  we estimate that full year results will be in the ranges shown below 
the outlook reflects results from continuing operations  and the per share information excludes any restructuring charges  integration costs or one time items 
the company anticipates million to million in charges related to previously announced cost containment initiatives and the integration of the globalnet acquisition 
in addition  the company may incur additional charges in if further cost reduction efforts are considered necessary 
full year revenue approx 
billion diluted earnings per share  in the range of to capital expenditures approx 
million liquidity and capital resources on december   the company had a working capital ratio of to and working capital of  on december   the company had a working capital ratio of to and working capital of  an increase of approximately million in working capital is due to the decrease in the current portion of long term debt as a result of renewing the revolving line of credit  since this debt was classified as current at december  and is classified as long term at december  in addition  approximately million of the increase in working capital is due to the acquisition of globalnet on september  this acquisition was funded with long term debt 
these increases in working capital were offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses related to an income tax receivable  as well as a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately million excluding the effect of acquisitions as a result of better collections in there was also an increase in accrued expenses related to higher restructuring accruals in the current year 
in february  the company completed a million private placement of senior unsecured notes with several institutional lenders 
the notes have an average life of years with an approximate interest rate of 
the proceeds from the private placement were used to pay down a portion of the company s existing revolving credit facility 
the company completed its new three year million revolving credit facility on july   which had an outstanding balance of million at december  the new credit agreement bears interest at libor plus basis points or an alternative base rate greater of federal funds rate plus basis points or the prime rate depending on certain leverage ratios 
the terms of the new notes and revolving credit agreement provide certain limitations on additional indebtedness  sale and leaseback transactions  asset sales and certain other transactions 
additionally  the company is subject to certain financial covenants based on its results of operations 
the company was in compliance with all loan covenants as of december  the senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of the company s subsidiaries 
due to the continued economic downturn and impact on the company s business  the revolving credit agreement and private placement notes were amended in march to modify certain financial covenant requirements and definitions 
under the terms of the amendment  the company will be required to meet revised debt to ebitda and fixed charge coverage ratios from the first quarter of through the first quarter of these financial covenant requirements will revert back to the previously existing covenant 
table of contents levels beginning in the second quarter of the new covenants are less restrictive than the previously existing covenants 
based upon its current projections  the company believes it will be in compliance with the revised quarterly loan covenants throughout fiscal in the event that actual results do not approximate forecasted results  management believes it could execute contingency plans to mitigate such effects 
such plans include additional cost reductions  asset sales  or seeking additional alternative financing 
while the company believes that it could obtain requisite additional financing  there can be no assurance that such financing would be available on a timely basis or on acceptable terms 
in consideration for the amendment  the company has agreed to provide accounts receivable as collateral 
the collateral will be shared proportionally between the parties to the revolving credit agreement and the senior unsecured notes 
in addition  interest rates charged under the revolving credit agreement have increased to libor plus basis points depending on certain leverage ratios as defined in the credit agreement  compared to libor plus basis points under the previously existing covenants 
interest rates charged under the senior unsecured notes have increased by basis points during the amendment period and a subsequent period during which the company must meet the original covenant requirements 
the company expects to pay an amendment fee to approving lenders of approximately million  which will be amortized to interest expense over the period covered by the amendment 
if the company failed to meet one or more of its loan covenants  such occurrence would be considered an event of default 
in the event the company was unable to obtain a waiver or unable to provide an allowable remedy for such event of default  the company s lenders would be entitled to certain remedies  including the ability to terminate their loan commitments and to demand immediate repayment  including payment in full 
were the company s lenders to demand immediate payment in full  the company could not make such payment from existing funds and would have to seek replacement financing 
while the company believes it would be able to obtain replacement financing  the company s ability to secure such replacement financing could not be guaranteed  and if necessary  such financing could carry higher costs 
it is expected that the cash generated from operations  working capital and the company s borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund its development and integration needs both foreign and domestic  finance future acquisitions  if any  and capital expenditures  provide for the payment of dividends  and meet the debt service requirements 
the company experiences certain seasonal factors with respect to its borrowing needs  the heaviest period for borrowing is normally the second quarter 
the company s existing borrowing capacity provides for this seasonal increase 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were  the company plans capital spending in a similar range for approximately million 
cash flows our focus on cash management continues  including managing receivables  inventory and free cash flow 
year to date average days sales outstanding improved to days in from days in the company had net cash provided by operating activities of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in reflects an increase in accrued expenses  as opposed to a decrease in that line item in the prior year 
this change is primarily caused by higher accruals for restructuring charges 
offsetting this is a smaller decrease in accounts receivable than experienced in the prior year  and a slight increase in inventory in the current year as opposed to a decrease in the prior year 
overall  cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased by almost million 
additionally  cash used in discontinued operations in was almost million lower than in the increase in reflects the impact of significant decreases in accounts receivable and inventory during  as opposed to increases in those asset classes in these changes in accounts receivable and inventory were offset by the impact of lower net income of approximately million in the change in prepaid assets provided an increase to cash flow from operations in of million  as there was a large prepaid balance at december  consisting of a net overpayment of estimated income taxes and equipment deposits that were awaiting reimbursement under a synthetic lease agreement 

table of contents there were also significant decreases in the employee compensation and benefits and accrued expense categories 
net cash used in investing activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the change from to was primarily a result of a decreased level of capital expenditures in  as well as proceeds recognized on the sale of certain printing assets and the chicago building in this was offset partially by a higher amount of cash paid for acquisitions than in  connected with the globalnet and decisionquest acquisitions 
the increase in was primarily a result of a higher amount of cash paid for acquisitions than in  connected with the mendez and dms acquisitions 
this was offset partially by a decreased level of capital expenditures in net cash provided by used in financing activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the change in primarily resulted from slightly higher net borrowings in  as compared to  as well as slightly higher proceeds from stock option exercises 
the change in primarily resulted from less funds used to acquire treasury stock resulting in a decrease in cash used for that purpose of million in 
this is offset by lower net borrowings in  as compared to  of million 
during the year ended december   the company used approximately million to repurchase shares of its common stock  in accordance with the board of directors authorization of the company s stock repurchase program 
these funds were provided through net borrowings during in the year ended december   the company used approximately thousand to repurchase shares of its common stock 
no shares were repurchased during the year ended december  contractual obligations and commercial commitments as previously discussed  the company s debt consists primarily of the senior unsecured notes issued in the private placement in february and the outstanding amounts under its revolving credit facility 
the company also leases equipment under leases that are accounted for as capital leases  where the equipment and related lease obligation are recorded on the company s balance sheet 
the company and its subsidiaries also occupy premises and utilize equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through the obligations under these operating leases are not recorded on the company s balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
many of these leases provide for payment of certain expenses and contain renewal and purchase options 
one operating lease is for printing equipment in the us and canada funded through a master agreement administered by a commercial bank and is commonly referred to as a synthetic lease 
at the expiration of the lease in april  the company has the right to roll the arrangement into a new lease or purchase the equipment for a guaranteed residual value 
as of december   the lease payments were based on the cost of the equipment plus libor plus or basis points while the canadian portion of the lease is based on canadian libor plus basis points 
the equipment under this lease as of december  has an aggregate residual value of approximately million  all of which is included in the table below in the future minimum synthetic lease payment amounts 
the company has borrowed the maximum under the agreement  leasing equipment with an aggregate initial cost of approximately million 
since this equipment is integral to the company s operations  the company will either buy the equipment or renew the lease when the lease expires 

table of contents the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments are summarized in the table below payments due by period contractual less than beyond obligations total year years years years years years debt operating leases capital lease obligations synthetic lease unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the operating lease obligations shown in the preceding table have not been reduced by minimum non cancelable sublease rentals aggregating approximately million 
the company remains secondarily liable under these leases in the event that the sublessee defaults under the sublease terms 
the company does not believe that material payments will be required under these agreements 
the company also has issued standby letters of credit in the ordinary course of business totaling  these letters of credit expire in  and 
the company also has issued a guarantee of up to million canadian dollars related to a credit facility of its canadian subsidiary  which would require payment by the company in the event of default on payment 
the amount outstanding under this credit facility at december  was us  the company does not use derivatives  variable interest entities  or any other form of off balance sheet financing 
the company is involved in certain minor joint venture arrangements that are intended to complement the company s core services and markets 
the company has the discretion to provide funding on occasion for working capital or capital expenditures 
the company makes an evaluation of additional funding based on an assessment of the venture s business opportunities 
the company believes that any possible commitments arising from these arrangements will not be significant to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the application of critical accounting policies the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting polices are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the selection and application of these accounting principles and methods requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as certain financial statement disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the recognition of revenue under the percentage of completion method of accounting  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  income tax provision and deferred taxes  restructuring costs  actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans  and contingent liabilities related to litigation and other claims and assessments 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while management believes that the estimates and assumptions it uses in preparing the financial statements are appropriate  these estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties regarding their ultimate outcome  and therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company has identified its critical accounting policies and estimates below 
these are policies and estimates that the company believes are the most important in portraying the company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of 
table of contents the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment a the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and b the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 business combinations  the company allocates the cost of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as customer relationships  are amortized to expense over time  while in process research and development costs  if any  are recorded as a one time charge at the acquisition date if it is determined that it has no alternative future use 
the company s future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of identifiable intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to goodwill 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on the company s future operating results 
the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to intangible assets and goodwill requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate to value these cash flows 
should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
the company has acquired certain identifiable intangible assets in connection with its acquisitions of donnelley enterprise solutions inc in  dms and mendez in  and globalnet and decisionquest in these identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of the value associated with customer relationships  trade name  covenants not to compete  software licenses and proprietary technology 
the valuation of these identifiable intangible assets is subjective and requires a great deal of expertise and judgment 
for these reasons  the company has used independent rd party valuation firms to value these assets 
the values of the customer relationships were primarily derived using estimates of future cash flows to be generated from the customer relationships 
this approach was used since the inherent value of the customer relationship is its ability to generate current and future income 
the value of the software licenses were derived using the market approach  which is based upon the value of similar or alternative technology 
this approach was used due to the uncertainty regarding the amount of future cash flows to be generated from the software license 
the value of the trade name was determined using an estimated market based royalty rate applied to projected future revenue 
the value of the proprietary technology was based on estimated replacement cost 
the value of the covenant not to compete was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology 
while different amounts would have been reported using different methods or using different assumptions  the company believes that the methods selected and the assumptions used are the most appropriate for each asset analyzed 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on january  this standard requires annual impairment testing of goodwill based upon the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units 
we completed our initial transitional test for goodwill impairment as of june   the result of which concluded that the goodwill balance was not impaired 
at december   our goodwill balance was  which primarily related to the globalization segment  and the outsourcing segment in testing for potential impairment of goodwill  sfas requires the company to allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates  estimate the fair value of those reporting units to which goodwill relates  and determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units 
furthermore  if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular reporting unit  then we are required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
only after this process is completed is the amount of goodwill impairment determined 
accordingly  the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
for impairment testing purposes  the company has utilized the services of independent consultants to perform valuations of the company s reporting units that 
table of contents contained significant balances of goodwill 
the fair value of the company s reporting units was estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital rate 
additionally  an assumed terminal growth rate was used to project future cash flows beyond base years 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected cash flows  terminal growth rates and the discount rate require considerable judgment and are based upon historical experience  financial forecasts  and industry trends and conditions 
these assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business 
based on our estimates  the company has concluded that there is no impairment of goodwill 
however  a decline in expected cash flows or the estimated terminal value could cause reporting units to be valued differently 
if the reporting units do not meet projected operating results  then this analysis could potentially result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge  depending on the estimated value of the company s reporting units 
additionally  an increase in the assumed discount rate weighted average cost of capital could also result in goodwill impairment 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue for substantially all services within its financial print and outsourcing segments when products or services are delivered to customers or when completed 
revenue for services provided within the company s globalization segment are recognized under the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various elements of the contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts  recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses toward completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the provision become known 
the company believes these revenue recognition methods best represent when the company has earned revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company realizes that it will be unable to collect all amounts that it bills to its customers 
therefore  it estimates the amount of billed receivables that it will be unable to collect and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts during each accounting period 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables 
the company s estimates are based on  among other things  the aging of its account receivables  its past experience collecting receivables  information about the ability of individual customers to pay  and current economic conditions 
while such estimates have been within our expectations and the provisions established  a change in financial condition of specific customers or in overall trends experienced may result in future adjustments of our estimates of recoverability of our receivables 
as of december   the company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of  accounting for income taxes accounting for taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations 
such judgments include  but would not be limited to  the likelihood the company would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  the adequacy of valuation allowances  and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
as part of the process of preparing the company s financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the judgments and estimates used are subject to challenge by domestic and foreign taxing authorities 
it is possible that either domestic or foreign taxing authorities could challenge those judgments and estimates and draw conclusions that would cause the company to incur liabilities in excess of those currently recorded 
the company uses an estimate of its annual effective tax rate at each interim period based upon the facts and circumstances available at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
changes in the geographical mix or estimated amount of annual pre tax income could impact the company s overall effective tax rate 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december  and  the company had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of  and  respectively 
at december  and  management determined that it is more 
table of contents likely than not that  and  respectively  of such assets will be realized  resulting in a valuation allowance of  and  respectively 
the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented 
accounting for pensions the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan in the us the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that expenses and liabilities recognized in financial statements be actuarially calculated 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the future performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plan 
the primary assumptions used in calculating pension expense and liability are related to the expected rate of return on plan assets  projected salary increases  and the discount rate at which the future obligations are discounted to value the liability 
the annual measurement date for these assumptions is december the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio 
management uses historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with anticipated future market conditions to estimate the rate of return 
since  the company had been using an expected return on plan assets assumption of  which was consistent with the long term asset returns of the portfolio 
during  management lowered the expected rate of return assumption to due to the expected lower future performance of the us equity markets 
each percentage point change in the assumed long term rate of return would result in a million change in pension expense 
the projected salary increase assumption is based upon historical trends and comparisons of the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate  it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
management has used the rate of for the past two years 
the discount rate assumption is tied to a long term high quality bond index and is therefore subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate was at december   compared to at december  and at december  the percent at december  was used to calculate the pension expense 
each percentage point change in the discount rate would result in a million change in the projected pension benefit obligation and a million change in pension expense 
restructuring accrual during fiscal and  the company recorded significant restructuring charges representing the direct costs of downsizing our business 
prior to the fourth quarter of  these costs were accrued in accordance with eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  whereas under eitf  the liability was recognized at the commitment date to an exit plan 

table of contents as a component of the restructuring charge of million  the company recorded an expense related to facility closures and lease termination costs totaling million 
the recorded amount was based on the fair value of contractual obligations contained in the leases net of estimated sublease income discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
this expense was recorded using our estimates of future expected cash flows associated with these office closings 
the liability associated with the facility closures will be adjusted for revisions related to the timing and amount of estimated cash flows in the period they become known 
useful lives of long lived assets the company estimates the useful lives of long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment and intangible assets based upon its estimates of how long those assets will provide economic benefits to the company 
the company believes its estimates are reasonable and consistent with other companies in the industry 
the company has not experienced significant changes to its useful lives in recent years  and therefore does not believe that it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity is required to capitalize the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and will be adopted by the company effective fiscal the company believes adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on its financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  whereas under eitf  the liability was recognized at the commitment date to an exit plan 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas effective for exit or disposal activities initiated in the fourth quarter of the impact of adoption of the statement was to recognize those charges relating to the company s restructuring plan that had met the liability recognition criteria under sfas certain charges that did not meet the liability recognition criteria will be recognized in future periods as the plan is implemented 
such charges to be recognized in future periods are estimated to be approximately million  and are included in the million to million of expected restructuring charges in connection with previously announced cost initiatives described on page in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation sets forth expanded disclosure requirements in the financial statements about a guarantor s obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that  under certain circumstances  a guarantor is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation at the inception of the guarantee 
certain types of guarantees  such as product warranties  guarantees accounted for as derivatives  and guarantees related to parent subsidiary relationships are excluded from the liability recognition provisions of fin  however  they are subject to disclosure requirements 
the initial liability recognition provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after december  the company believes that the adoption of this interpretation will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 

table of contents sfas also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method on reported results 
although the company continues to apply apb opinion no 
and related interpretations  the company has adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas during the fourth quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is principally associated with trends in the domestic and international capital markets  particularly in the financial print segment and the outsourcing segment 
this includes trends in the initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions markets  both important components of the financial printing segment 
the company also has market risk tied to interest rate fluctuations related to its debt obligations and fluctuations in foreign currency  as discussed below 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio  long term debt obligations  revolving credit agreement and synthetic lease commitment 
we do not use derivative instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
our senior unsecured notes issued in february consist of fixed rate instruments  and therefore  would not be impacted by changes in interest rates 
the notes have an average life of years ranging from years  and had an average interest rate of approximately for the year ended december  amounts borrowed under the new three year million revolving credit facility that was signed in july bear interest at libor plus basis points or an alternative base rate greater of federal funds rate plus basis points or the prime rate depending on certain leverage ratios 
during the year ended december   the average interest rate on both the new and old lines of credit approximated 
a hypothetical change in the annual interest rate of per annum would result in a change in interest expense of approximately million  based on the average outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility during the year ended december  the rental payments on the company s synthetic lease are based upon the cost of the equipment plus libor plus or basis points while the canadian portion of the lease is based on canadian libor plus basis points 
the synthetic lease had a remaining principal balance of million as of december  since this equipment is integral to the company s operations  the company will either buy the equipment or renew the lease when the lease expires 
foreign exchange rates the company derives a portion of its revenues from various foreign sources 
to date  the company has not experienced significant gains or losses as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rates of the related foreign currencies 
however  as the company expands its global presence  fluctuations may become significant 
the company s globalization segment is impacted by foreign currency fluctuations since its labor costs are predominantly denominated in foreign currencies  while a significant portion of its revenue is denominated in us dollars 
this is somewhat mitigated by the fact that revenue from the company s international financial print operations is denominated in foreign currencies  while some of its costs are denominated in us dollars 
to date  the company has not used foreign currency hedging instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations 
the company has reflected translation income loss of  and  in its statements of comprehensive income loss for the years ended december  and this income loss is primarily attributed to the fluctuation in value between the us dollar and the euro  pound sterling and canadian dollar 
equity price risk we currently do not have any significant investments in marketable equity securities 
the company s defined benefit pension plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities 
the amount of the company s annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon  among other things  the return on the plan s assets 
to the extent there are fluctuations in equity prices  the amount of the company s annual contribution could be affected 
for example  a decrease in equity prices could increase the amount of the company s annual contributions to the plan
