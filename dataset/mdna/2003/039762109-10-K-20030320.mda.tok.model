certain statements contained in management s discussion and analysis  in other parts of this report and in other company filings are forward looking statements 
these statements discuss  among other things  future sales growth  operating results and financial condition 
forward looking statements reflect the company s current plans and expectations regarding important risk factors and are based on information currently available to us 
the company cautions readers that any forward looking statements contained in this report or made by the management of the company involve risks and uncertainties  and are subject to change based on various important factors 
the following factors  among others  could affect the company s financial results and could cause the company s financial performance to differ materially from the expectations expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company the strength of the us economy  in particular  the economic conditions in southern california  the effects of and changes in fiscal policies and laws  as well as  changes in accounting policies and practices  inflation or deflation  potential business disruptions from acts of terrorism or national emergencies  the impact of fluctuations in the company s stock price on compensation expense  the ability of vendors  including unified western grocers  inc  to continue providing products and services in a timely manner  consolidations in the supermarket industry and competition from other supermarkets and food retailers  some of which are non union  the ability to renew current leases at favorable rates  the ability of the company to materially increase sales at its new pasadena store which is dependent upon  among other things  the nature and success of the other tenants businesses in the center and the ability of potential gelson s customers to accept and use the center s underground parking and validation system  whether the landlord of the century city shopping center implements a major construction project  the details of such project as and if implemented  and the effect of such project on the gelson s store  the amount of future premium increases incurred by the company in order to maintain adequate insurance coverage  the impact of the company s workers compensation safety records and claims experience and any changes to the insurance industry s rating process and premium schedules on workers compensation expense  the retirement of existing senior management  the term of any future suspension and subsequent reinstatement of union pension contributions  the number of hours worked by the applicable union employees  the required rate of contribution and the future rate of return received by the union pension plans on their investments  the adequacy of self insurance reserves for reported claims and incurred but not reported claims and the rate of increase in health care costs  the impact of uninsured losses  any changes in assumptions or market conditions that could affect management s estimate of future cash flows when evaluating assets for impairment 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management has established accounting policies that they believe are appropriate in order to ensure the accurate reporting of the company s operating results  financial position and cash flows 
the company applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner 
management bases their estimates on historical experience  current and expected economic conditions and various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company reevaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  and therefore actual results may differ from these estimates 
management believes that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of the company s financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
investments investments are accounted for under the provisions of sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date 
debt securities for which the company does not have the intent or ability to hold to maturity and equity securities are classified as available for sale investments and any unrealized holding gains and losses are included as a separate component of stockholders equity 
inventories the company estimates inventory adjustments based on historical experience derived from periodic physical inventories and other factors 
allowances for inventory adjustments are recorded based on these estimates to properly reflect inventory at the balance sheet date 
impairment of long lived assets the company monitors the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value 
if impairment is identified  a loss would be recorded equal to the excess of the asset s net book value over the asset s fair value 
general auto liability costs the company is primarily self insured for losses related to general and auto liability claims for up to  accruals are based on reported claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
while the ultimate amount of claims incurred are dependent on future developments  in management s opinion  recorded reserves are adequate to cover the future payment of claims 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time of sale 
discounts given to customers are recorded at the point of sale as a reduction of revenues 
the company maintains a bad debt allowance for receivables from vendors and gelson s credit card sales 
valuation reserves are adjusted periodically based on historical recovery rates 
merchandise costs vendor rebates  credits and promotional allowances that relate to the company s buying and merchandising activities  including lump sum payments associated with long term contracts  are recorded as a component of merchandise costs as they are earned in accordance with the underlying agreement 
stock options and stock appreciation rights the company accounts for its stock option plan using the intrinsic value based method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized in the company s statements of operations and comprehensive income for fiscal years  or sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  encourages adoption of a fair value based method for valuing the cost of stock based compensation 
however  it allows companies to use the intrinsic value based method prescribed by apb and disclose pro forma net earnings and earnings per share in accordance with sfas stock based compensation under the sars program is subject to variable accounting in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
as a result  changes in the market price of the company s class a common stock impacts the sars compensation charge 
results of operations compared to income before income taxes in increased to  compared to  during operating income increased to  in compared to  in sales from the company s supermarkets all of which are located in southern california were  in this represents an increase of over  which were  the majority of the sales increase is attributable to the opening of the pasadena store in september same store sales increased in compared to the prior year 
in september  the company opened a gelson s market in a multi use center in pasadena  california which is currently performing significantly below management s expectations 
sales at the pasadena store should improve as existing retail tenants become more established and potential gelson s customers accept and use the underground parking at the center 
however  the occurrence of these events does not guarantee that sales at the pasadena store will increase to originally estimated levels 
enhancements have recently been made to the interior of the store  as well as to traffic flow in the garage and signage  but these changes have not yet resulted in a significant increase in sales 
if sales at the pasadena store do not materially increase  the company s fixed assets at that store could become impaired 
the company has the right  under certain circumstances  to terminate its lease in the spring of which would result in a significant write off of fixed assets and other costs 
the company s gross profit as a percent of sales was at in compared to in product pricing decisions  increased buying allowances and to a limited extent lower supply costs contributed to the increase in margins 
delivery  selling  general and administrative dsg a expense as a percent of sales was in compared to in effective may  the company s contributions to a multi employer union pension plan were reinstated for a period of six months 
as described below  payments to the union pension plan had been suspended since late the additional cost related to the contribution reinstatement was approximately  in dsg a expense as a percent of sales also increased in due in part to the inclusion of the pasadena store for a full fiscal year 
in addition  an increase in workers compensation premiums and union health care costs contributed to the rise in dsg a expense 
compensation expense relating to stock appreciation rights sars decreased from  in to  in the company contributes to several multi employer union pension plans 
contributions to the union pension plan  covering a majority of the company s employees  were suspended in in may  the southern california united food commercial workers unions and the food employers joint trust funds the trust reinstated for six months the contribution requirement for all companies with employees belonging to these unions 
contributions to the multi employer union pension fund were suspended by the trust for hours worked during the four month period beginning november and ending february and reinstated for hours worked commencing march during the six month reinstatement period in fiscal  the company incurred average incremental monthly expense of approximately  the actual pension payment is dependent upon straight time hours worked and the required rate of contribution 
stock based compensation is subject to variable accounting in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
as a result  changes in the market price of the company s class a common stock impacts the compensation charge related to sars 
assuming the company s stock price remains at the december  closing price of  the company anticipates sars compensation expense of approximately  on an after tax basis related to the additional vesting of sars 
each dollar increase or decrease in the company s stock price will result in approximately  after tax compensation expense or expense reduction to the extent compensation expense was previously recognized  respectively 
the above estimates are based on the number of outstanding sars as of december  the exercise of these sars or the issuance of additional sars would cause the estimates to vary 
since october  the company has purchased guaranteed costs workers compensation insurance 
effective october  the annual premium for workers compensation increased  over the prior year due primarily to the expiriation of a low premium policy and to industry wide price increases 
earlier in  california passed legislation effective january  aimed at reforming the workers compensation insurance system in the state 
at this point in time  the company is unable to predict how this legislation will impact the insurance industry s rating process and  ultimately  the long term effect on future premiums 
the company devotes substantial time and commitment to maintaining a safe work environment and continues to review opportunities to contain workers compensation insurance costs 
the company is primarily self insured for losses related to general and auto liability claims for up to  accruals are based on reported claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
the company s liability reserve for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims at december  was approximately  while the ultimate amount of claims incurred are dependent on future developments  in management s opinion  recorded reserves are adequate to cover the future payment of claims 
the company also carries property  business interruption  fiduciary  directors and officers  crime  earthquake  special event and employee practices liability insurance 
management believes  based on recent and past experience  that current insurance coverage is adequate to meet the requirements of the company 
the company procures approximately percent of its product through unified western grocers  inc unified  a grocery cooperative 
as a member patron  the company is required to provide unified with certain minimum deposits and credit in order to purchase product from the cooperative 
as of december   the company had approximately  on deposit with unified 
the minimum deposit requirement is satisfied through a combination of cash  credit and ownership of equity shares in unified 
in september  unified s board of directors authorized a quasi reorganization that eliminated its accumulated deficit in retained earnings and restated assets and liabilities to their fair values 
unified s board of directors has adopted an equity enhancement plan for its fiscal year 
under the equity enhancement plan  member patrons will receive five year low interest bearing subordinated patronage dividend certificates in lieu of amounts previously paid in cash and class b shares 
in  the company earned approximately  in subordinated patronage dividend certificates 
in the event unified continues to incur reductions in earned surplus  the company may face impairment issues relating to the deposits provided to unified 
in view of the above the company has currently elected not to recognize the patronage dividend as income until the certificates are redeemed 
the company will evaluate this policy on an annual basis based on facts and circumstances as they exist in the future 
interest and dividend income was  in compared to  for primarily due to lower interest rates in interest expense decreased to  in from  in primarily due to the prepayment of fixture financing debt in october other income includes gains realized on investments of  and  in and  respectively 
unrealized gains on investments were  net of income tax expense of  in compared to unrealized losses of  net of income tax benefits of  in a major road improvement project has commenced along santa monica boulevard in west los angeles  california  which is estimated to last approximately three years 
at some times during the construction schedule  construction will occur directly in front of  or very close to  the century city shopping center  where gelson s has its century city store 
it can be expected that the sales of the century city store will be negatively impacted during the period when the construction is at or near the century city shopping center  but that access to the shopping center is expected to be improved once the roadway project has been completed 
in addition  the landlord of the century city shopping center has discussed with gelson s the landlord s tentative plans for a major construction project which could result in the relocation of the movie theaters and other tenants to newly constructed areas immediately adjacent to the gelson s store 
those plans also include the expansion of the gelson s store 
the company does not know if or when this project might begin or how long it could take 
the project is in the very preliminary planning and discussion stage 
the company expects  however  that the sales of the century city store will be negatively affected during this construction 
although the company also expects that the parking for gelson s customers would be adversely affected by relocating the theaters and other tenants to the immediate vicinity of the gelson s store  it also anticipates that the relocation will increase foot traffic in the vicinity of the store and that the expanded store with additional facilities and services and the increased foot traffic will increase the number of customers

same store sales increased in compared to the prior year 
the increase in same store sales reflects to some extent the positive impact of store remodel activity and pricing 
in september  the company opened a gelson s market in a multi use center in pasadena  california which performed below management s expectations 
management expects sales to improve as consumers respond to a local advertising and pricing campaign  the apartments located above the store are occupied  existing retail tenants become more established and enhancements to parking and traffic flow are implemented 
however  the occurrence of these events does not guarantee that sales at the pasadena store will increase to originally anticipated levels 
the company s gross profit as a percent of sales was at in compared to in added controls over product costs  product pricing decisions and increased buying and promotional allowances contributed to the increase in margins 
dsg a expense as a percent of sales was in compared to in the company recognized compensation expense related to sars of approximately  and  during the fourth quarter and year ended december   respectively  due to an increase in the company s stock price in earnings per share decreased

per share during the fourth quarter and year ended december  salaries and promotions expense in increased due to the opening of new stores  as described above 
in addition  a substantial increase in workers compensation premiums also contributed to the rise in dsg a expense in spite of the company s favorable claims experience 
the company contributes to several multi employer union pension plans 
contributions to the union pension plan  covering the majority of the company s employees  were suspended during and the pension plan trustees have reserved the right to reinstate the pension contribution with minimal notice

unified has recognized reductions in earned surplus in each of its fiscal years ending september  and september  unified s board of directors has adopted an equity enhancement plan for its fiscal year 
under the equity enhancement plan  member patrons will receive interest bearing subordinated patronage dividend certificates in lieu of amounts previously paid in cash 
the company has historically received less than  annually in patronage dividends in the form of cash and class b shares

the company believes it substantially complies  and has in the past substantially complied  with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and private covenants 
the company cannot  at this time  estimate the expense it ultimately may incur in connection with any current or future violations  however  it believes any such claims will not have a material adverse impact on either the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company s current cash position including investments  the lines of credit and net cash provided by operating activities are the primary sources of funds available to meet the company s capital expenditures and liquidity requirements

the following table sets forth the company s contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of december  contractual cash obligations in thousands total less than year years years after years subordinated income debentures due september including interest capital lease obligations including interest operating leases total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments in thousands total less than year years years after years standby letter of credit the standby letter of credit is maintained pursuant to the company s workers compensation self insurance requirements for open claims incurred prior to recent accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
these statements change the accounting for business combinations and goodwill in two significant ways 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for business combinations 
use of the pooling of interests method will be prohibited 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
adoption of sfas and in the company s fiscal year did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which replaces sfas  accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas establishes one accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for the recognition  measurement and reporting of impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
adoption of sfas in the company s fiscal year did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  this standard is not expected to have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transaction and disclosure transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company will adopt the disclosure only provision of this statement effective with the first quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company could be exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates to its  and  revolving lines of credit 
borrowings under the agreements bear interest as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
there were no borrowings outstanding under either line as of december  consequently  a hypothetical interest rate change would have no impact on the company s results of operations 
a change in market prices also exposes the company to market risk related to its investments which totaled  as of december  a hypothetical drop in the market value of these investments would result in a  unrealized pretax loss and a corresponding loss of a like amount in the fair value of these instruments 
this hypothetical drop would not affect cash flow and would not have an impact on earnings until the investments were disposed of or the decline is deemed permanent 
in order to minimize the risk associated with market value fluctuations  the company actively manages its exposure through the regular review of its investment portfolio 
the review takes into consideration  among other things  the risk level of the individual investments  the amount invested in each and current economic conditions
