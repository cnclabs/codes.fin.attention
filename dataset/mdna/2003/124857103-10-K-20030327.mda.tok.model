the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results of operations  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
for a summary of the company s significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
the following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates 
accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with sop  which requires management s judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program 
these estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs  expensing of participation and residual cost and any necessary net realizable value adjustments 
the cost of blockbuster s rental library  which includes videocassettes  dvds and games  is amortized over periods ranging from to months to an estimated residual value of to per unit  according to the product category 
the estimates for useful lives and residual values of the rental library are continually evaluated based on changes in consumer demand 
changes in demand or buying patterns may impact the carrying value of the rental library and rental margins 
during  blockbuster changed the estimates regarding useful lives and residual values for videocassettes and game products  which resulted in inventory write downs and increased amortization expense 
the company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and ii liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  asset lives  and market multiples  among other items 
the company assesses potential impairment of long lived assets under the guidance of sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
goodwill and other intangibles are evaluated for impairment under the guidance of sfas which was adopted in the first quarter of upon adoption  the company determined that based on segment valuation studies with the exception of blockbuster  none of the company s reporting units had an impairment 
the write down of blockbuster s goodwill of billion was determined after the fair value of blockbuster had been allocated to specific assets and liabilites and was recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
subsequently  blockbuster performed its annual impairment test on october  and there was no additional impairment under the provisions of sfas for sfas requires companies to test for goodwill impairment annually and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below the unit s carrying amount 
during december  blockbuster performed an interim impairment test on its goodwill balance as of december  which determined that its estimated fair value  under sfas  was in excess of book value 
as a result  there was no additional impairment 
blockbuster will perform its annual impairment test for on october   and on an interim date in should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test 
a significant downward revision in the estimated future cash flows could result in a material impairment of goodwill under sfas the company s cost and equity investments  where market value has declined below cost  are regularly reviewed by management to determine whether or not there has been an other than temporary decline in market value 
in making that determination  management considers the extent to which cost exceeds market value  the duration of the market decline  the investees earnings and cash forecasts and current cash position  among other factors 
in  the company recorded a non cash impairment loss of approximately million 
in  the company recorded a non cash impairment loss of approximately million 
balance sheet reserves and liabilities related to taxes  legal issues  restructuring charges and discontinued businesses  including asbestos and environmental matters  require significant judgments and estimates by management 
the company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates 
while management believes that the current reserves for matters related to discontinued business  including environmental and asbestos are adequate  there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods 
pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions 
two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled 
the company used investment grade corporate bond yields to support its discount rate assumption 
the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets 
for  the unrecognized actuarial loss for pension plans increased significantly as a result of lowering the discount rate for the company s major plans from in to in  other actuarial losses and plan assets producing a return below the expected return due to market conditions in as of december   total pension benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of corresponding plan assets and therefore the company recorded an additional pension liability of million 
the expected increased pension expense due to decreases in pension plan ii asset values and expected rate of return on such assets will not result in increased company pension plan contributions 
cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements this document and the documents incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k  including item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition  contain both historical and forward looking statements 
all statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are not based on historical facts  but rather reflect the company s current expectations concerning future results and events 
these forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as believe  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  foresee  likely  will or other similar words or phrases 
similarly  statements that describe the company s objectives  plans or goals are or may be forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be different from any future results  performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements 
the following important factors  among others  could affect future results  causing these results to differ materially from those expressed in the company s forward looking statements the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on its over the air networks  basic cable networks  television stations  radio stations and outdoor businesses 
the sale of advertising is affected by viewer demographics  viewer ratings and market conditions for advertising 
adverse changes to any of these factors  including as a result of acts of terrorism or war  could have a negative effect on revenues 
additionally  consumer and advertiser actions in response to the war in iraq could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
operating results derived from the company s motion picture and television production businesses fluctuate depending primarily upon cost of such productions and acceptance of such productions by the public  which are difficult to predict 
motion picture and television production has experienced cycles in which increased costs of talent  reduced availability of co financing opportunities  and other factors have resulted in higher production costs 
in addition  the commercial success of the company s motion picture and television productions depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing productions  and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities 
the company s operating results fluctuate due to the timing and availability of theatrical and home video releases  as well as the recording of license fees for television exhibition of motion pictures and for syndication and basic cable exhibition of television programming in the period that the products are available for such exhibition 
the company s basic cable networks and premium subscription television networks are dependent upon affiliation agreements with cable and direct to home dth distributors on acceptable terms 
the loss of carriage on such distributors  or continued carriage on less favorable terms  could adversely affect  with respect to basic cable networks  revenues from subscriber fees and the ability to sell advertising  and with respect to premium subscription television networks  subscriber fee revenues 
in addition  continued consolidation among cable and or dth distributors could have an adverse effect on subscriber fee revenues 
some of the company s businesses are seasonal 
the home video and consumer publishing businesses are subject to increased periods of demand coinciding with summer and winter holidays  while a substantial majority of the theme parks operating income is generated from may through ii september 
in addition  the home video and theme parks businesses revenues are influenced by weather 
the company s radio and outdoor advertising businesses experience fluctuations based on the timing of advertising expenditures by retailers and typically experience highest revenues in the fourth quarter and lowest revenues in the first quarter 
the company s home video retail business currently enjoys a competitive advantage over most other movie distribution channels  except theatrical releases  due to the early timing of the video retailer distribution window 
the video business could be negatively affected if the video retail distribution windows were no longer the first following the theatrical release  the length of the video retail distribution window was shortened  or the video retail distribution windows were no longer as exclusive as they are now 
the company believes that the studios have a significant interest in maintaining a viable video retail industry  however  the order  length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the movie and the company cannot predict the impact  if any  of any future decisions by the studios 
increased studio licensing of product to video on demand and similar services might impact their decisions with respect to the timing and exclusivity of the video retailer distribution window with possible adverse affect on the video business 
the company cannot control or predict with certainty studio pricing policies for dvd and vhs product 
sell through pricing of dvds has reduced the significance of the rental window for vhs product and has resulted in competition from mass merchant retailers at an earlier stage than is the case for vhs 
if sell through pricing and competition cause consumers to increasingly desire to purchase rather than rent movies  the video business could be negatively affected if it is unable to increase rental market share  to replace profits from rentals with profits from sales of sell through product  or to otherwise positively affect gross profits 
in addition  if studios make future changes in their pricing policies  which could include pricing rental windows for dvds or expanded exploitation by studios of any international copyright laws that allow studios to charge retailers more for dvd and vhs rental product than for sell through product  the profitability of the video business could be negatively affected if it is unable to enter into arrangements with the studios that effectively balance copy depth and cost considerations 
changes in fcc laws and regulations could  directly or indirectly  adversely affect the operations and ownership of the company s properties 
the company has contingent liabilities related to discontinued businesses  including environmental liabilities and pending litigation 
while the pending or potential litigations  and environmental and other liabilities should not have a material adverse effect on the company  there can be no assurance in this regard 
the company may be adversely affected by changes in technology and its effect on competition in the company s markets  including technologies that increase the threat of content piracy 
other economic  business  competitive and or regulatory factors could affect the company s businesses generally 
these factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements 
other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on our future results 
the forward looking statements included in this document are only made as of the date of this document  and the company does not have any obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances
