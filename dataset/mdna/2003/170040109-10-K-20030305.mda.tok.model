item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global pharmaceutical company that participates in three healthcare markets biopharmaceuticals  vaccines and blood testing 
our revenues consist of product sales  equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint businesses  collaborative agreement revenues  royalty and license fee revenues and other revenues 
the biopharmaceuticals segment consists of therapeutic products and services  with an emphasis on the treatment of cancer and infectious disease  using the development and acquisition of technologies related to therapeutic proteins and small molecules 
the biopharmaceuticals segment also includes collaborations with berlex laboratories  inc and its parent company  schering ag of germany  related to betaseron 
the vaccines segment consists of a meningococcal vaccine  flu vaccines  travel vaccines  which include rabies and tick borne encephalitis vaccines and pediatric vaccines 
we sell these vaccines primarily in germany  italy  the united kingdom and other international markets 
our vaccines segment is also involved in the development of other novel vaccines and vaccination technology 
the blood testing segment consists of an alliance with gen probe incorporated and our one half interest in the pretax operating earnings of our joint business with ortho clinical diagnostics  inc  a johnson johnson company 
our alliance with gen probe is focused on developing and commercializing nucleic acid testing products using transcription mediated amplification technology to screen donated blood and plasma products for viral infection 
our joint business with ortho clinical diagnostics sells a line of immunodiagnostic tests to detect hepatitis viruses and retroviruses and provides supplemental tests and microplate and chemiluminescent instrument systems to automate test performance and data collection 
we view certain other revenues and expenses as not belonging to any one segment 
as a result  we have aggregated these items into an other segment 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  inventories  derivatives  intangible assets  product discounts  rebates and returns  bad debts  collaborative  royalty and license arrangements  restructuring  pension and other post retirement benefits  income taxes  and litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investments we invest in marketable debt and equity securities 
the prices of our marketable securities are subject to significant volatility 
we record an impairment charge when we believe that an investment in a marketable security has experienced a decline in fair value  as measured by quoted market prices  that is other than temporary 
we believe that an investment in a marketable security is impaired if its quoted market price has been below its carrying value for each trading day in a six month period  at which point we write down the investment 
in addition  in determining whether impairment of a marketable equity security is considered to be other than temporary  we consider all available factors in the evaluation 
these factors may include  but are not limited to  i whether the issuer of the securities is experiencing depressed and declining earnings in relation to competitors  erosion of market share  and deteriorating financial position  ii whether the issuer is experiencing financial difficulties and its market is experiencing difficulties  iii ongoing activity in our collaborations with the issuer  if any and iv the issuer s prospects for favorable clinical trial results  new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements 
decreases in the fair value of these securities may impact our profitability 
to reduce this risk  we hedge a portion of our exposure through forward sales contracts 
inventories we maintain inventory reserves primarily for product failures  recalls and obsolescence 
the manufacturing processes for many of our products are complex 
slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process may result in unacceptable changes in the products that may result in failures or recalls and  therefore  additional inventory reserves 
obsolete inventory  due to the expiration of shelf life  and the seasonal nature of some of our products  may result in additional product reserves 
in estimating inventory obsolescence reserves  we analyze on a product by product basis i the shelf life and the expiration date  ii sales forecasts and iii inventory levels compared to forecasted usage obtained from the production planning department 
judgment is required in determining whether the forecasted sales and usage information is sufficiently reliable to enable us to estimate inventory obsolescence reserve 
in addition  we operate in a highly competitive environment  with rapidly changing technologies 
new technology or changes in production processes may result in product obsolescence 
as a result  we may be required to record additional inventory reserves 
product returns and rebates for existing and acquired products  we maintain accruals for product returns and rebates by utilizing historical information 
for new products  we estimate our accruals for product returns and rebates based on the specific terms for product returns and rebates and our experience with similar products 
in estimating returns  we analyze i historical returns and sales patterns  ii current inventory on hand at the distributors and in the distribution channel and the remaining shelf life of that inventory  iii current economic trends  iv distributors practices  v changes in demand  particularly due to the seasonality of certain of our products and vi introduction of new competing products 
in arriving at the accrual for product returns we use one of the following four methodologies depending on the product i we calculate the average actual returns percentage for the previous rolling twelve months on a product by product basis and apply it to gross sales on a product by product basis for the last twelve months to arrive at the reserve balance required at the balance sheet date 
the change in the reserve balance is recognized as a charge against revenue for the period  ii we match the actual returns to the actual sale on a product by product basis to assess the historical trend for returns 
based on an analysis of the historical trend  the appropriate return percentage for the current period is then applied to current period sales to arrive at the product returns charge against revenue for the period  iii we calculate the average returns percentage for the previous rolling twelve months on a product by product basis and apply it to inventory on hand at the distributors on a product by product basis or iv for seasonal products we analyze our actual returns over the previous seasons to arrive at the average actual returns percentage  which is then applied to the current season s sales to arrive at the charge against revenue for the current period 
in estimating rebates  we match the actual rebates to the actual sale on a product by product basis  to arrive at an actual rebates percentage 
this actual rebate percentage is applied to current period sales to arrive at the rebates expense for the period 
in addition  we consider allowable prices by medicaid and medicare 
if actual product returns and rebates are greater than our estimates  additional product return and rebates accruals may be required 
collaborative  royalty and license arrangements we recognize up front refundable fees as revenues upon the later of when they become nonrefundable or when performance obligations are completed 
in situations where continuing performance obligations exist  we defer and amortize up front nonrefundable fees ratably over the performance period  which is typically stipulated by the contract  otherwise  we recognize them as revenues when collection is reasonably assured 
in arrangements with multiple deliverables  there may be significant judgment in separating the different revenue generating activities and in determining whether each is a separate earnings process 
milestones  if any  related to scientific or technical achievements are recognized in income when the milestone is accomplished 
the terms of such arrangements may cause our operating results to vary considerably from period to period 
we estimate royalty revenues based on previous period royalties received or on product sales forecast information provided by the third party licensee 
in the subsequent quarter  we record an adjustment equal to the difference between those estimated royalty revenues recorded in the previous quarter and the contractual percentage of the third party s actual product sales for that period 
we exercise judgment in determining whether the forecast information provided by licensees is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
if we determined that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net deferred tax assets  adjustments to the deferred tax assets would increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that we made such determination 
likewise  if we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments to the deferred tax assets would decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that we made such determination 
litigation and other contingencies we establish and maintain accruals for litigation and other contingencies when we believe a loss to be probable and reasonably estimable  as required by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we base our accruals on information available internally within the company at the time of such determination and after management has consulted with and obtained advise from external professional advisors 
judgment is required in both the determination of probability and as to whether such an exposure is reasonable estimable 
information may become available to us after that time  for which adjustments to accruals may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for various products and business strategies 
if any of the significant assumptions differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  this could result in different valuations for goodwill and intangible assets 
once it is established  we must test goodwill annually for impairment using a two step process as required by sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  in certain circumstances  we must assess if goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests 
intangible assets with definite useful lives must be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we conduct our impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles  factors that are considered important in determining whether impairment might exist include significant continued under performance compared to peers  significant changes in the underlying business and products of our reporting units  or other factors specific to each asset or reporting unit being evaluated 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in note  the company and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on july   we completed our acquisition of pulmopharm gmbh  a distributor of tobi products in germany and austria by purchasing the remaining ownership that we did not previously own 
previously  we owned of pulmopharm and accounted for the investment under the equity method 
we accounted for the acquisition of this business under the purchase method of accounting and included pulmopharm s operating results in our consolidated operating results beginning on july  pulmopharm is part of our biopharmaceuticals segment 
on february   we acquired matrix pharmaceutical  inc  a company that was developing tezacitabine  a drug to treat cancer 
we accounted for the acquisition as an asset purchase and included matrix pharmaceutical s operating results  including the seven business days from february to   in our consolidated operating results beginning on march  matrix pharmaceutical is part of our biopharmaceuticals segment 
on september   we acquired pathogenesis corporation  a company that developed and marketed drugs to treat infectious diseases  particularly serious lung infections 
we accounted for the acquisition as a business combination using the purchase method of accounting and included pathogenesis operating results  including the seven business days from september to   in our consolidated operating results beginning on october  pathogenesis operating results for the seven business days in september were not significant to our consolidated operating results 
pathogenesis is part of our biopharmaceuticals segment 
certain minor arithmetical variances between the following narrative and the consolidated financial statements may arise due to rounding 
results of operations biopharmaceuticals product sales biopharmaceutical product sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
biopharmaceutical product sales in and consisted principally of betaseron  tobi and proleukin 
biopharmaceutical product sales in consisted principally of betaseron and proleukin 
betaseron we manufacture betaseron for sale outside of europe and betaferon for sale in europe and certain other international markets by berlex laboratories  inc and its parent company  schering ag of germany 
betaseron is approved for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in over countries  including the us and the european union  and for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis in approximately countries  including the european union  canada  australia and new zealand 
we recognize a portion of revenue for product sales of betaseron upon shipment to berlex laboratories and schering  and the remainder based on a contractual percentage of sales by berlex laboratories and schering 
we also earn royalties on schering s sales of betaferon  manufactured by boehringer ingelheim  which we record in royalty and license fee revenues for the biopharmaceuticals segment 
betaseron product sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in betaseron product sales in as compared with  primarily related to i increased underlying sales to end users in the us and certain international markets driven partially by increased utilization of beta interferon therapy for multiple sclerosis due to more patients  ii price increases and iii fluctuations in berlex laboratories and schering s inventory levels  as well as wholesaler inventory levels  following the launch of a new room temperature formulation 
prior to  we accounted for non us product sales based on information provided by schering on a one quarter lag 
more current information of non us betaseron sales was available in  and as a result  we were able to recognize betaseron product sales on a current basis 
as a result  there were incremental product sales revenues recognized during the first quarter of million 
inventory ordering patterns as well as foreign currency exchange rates may influence future betaseron sales 
the increase in betaseron product sales in as compared with primarily related to fluctuations in berlex laboratories and schering s inventory levels and increased underlying sales to end users in the us and other countries driven by increased utilization of beta interferon therapy for multiple sclerosis 
as discussed in royalties and license fee revenues below  betaferon royalties also increased in as compared with  and in as compared with pursuant to our agreement with schering  we began supplying betaferon to schering in the fourth quarter for certain additional european markets  which was previously supplied by boehringer ingelheim 
this resulted in a shift of revenue recognized under this agreement to product sales  and a decrease in royalty revenues beginning in the fourth quarter the exact shift of revenue in the future will be contingent on our production capacity and market demand and is expected to increase over the next three years 
overall biopharmaceutical earnings is expected to be largely unaffected by the transition 
in addition  under the terms of this agreement  our royalty percentage for betaferon will decrease in the fourth quarter by approximately 
in  we began to ship product to schering for sale in switzerland 
in order to supply betaferon to schering  we are required to make capital improvements to our existing manufacturing facilities to increase capacity 
during  we recorded charges related to this project 
see research and development below 
tobi we obtained tobi as part of our acquisition of pathogenesis corporation on september  we sell tobi directly in the us and certain international markets 
we recognized tobi sales of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
increased tobi sales primarily related to i the progress of the launch in various european countries  ii increased use and compliance in the us by patients with cystic fibrosis and iii price increases 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  principally the euro  have also contributed slightly to the increase in tobi sales 
in  these increases were partially offset by an increased level of medicaid rebates 
increased tobi sales in as compared with related to the recognition of a full year of sales in as compared to the recognition of approximately one quarter of sales in we continue to pursue the use of tobi to treat other serious lung infections and to seek approval in other countries 
wholesale ordering patterns as well as reimbursement pressures  foreign currency exchange rates and the level of rebates may influence future tobi sales 
proleukin proleukin is approved in over countries for the treatment of metastatic stage iv renal cell carcinoma and in canada and the us for the treatment of metastatic stage iv melanoma 
sales of proleukin were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
proleukin product sales in as compared with increased primarily as a result of stabilization of wholesale ordering patterns  from those experienced in  relative to demand and price increases 
in  wholesalers significantly reduced inventories from quantities held at the end of in  wholesalers decreased inventories only slightly 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  principally the euro  have also contributed slightly to the increase in proleukin sales 
proleukin product sales in as compared with were affected by i the fluctuation of wholesale ordering patterns relative to demand  ii the increasing cost sensitivity from reimbursement authorities  particularly in europe and iii a weaker exchange rate of the euro as compared with the us dollar 
in  wholesalers significantly increased inventories from quantities held at the end of wholesale ordering patterns  reimbursement pressures and foreign currency exchange rates may influence future proleukin sales 
the balance of product sales recognized in our biopharmaceuticals segment consisted of various other products  which individually were not material 
we expect competitive pressures related to many of our biopharmaceutical products to continue into the future  primarily as a result of the introduction of competing products into the market  as listed in part i  item  business competition above 
specifically  in december  the us food and drug administration conditionally approved an abbreviated new drug application for an inhaled tobramycin that is intended to be launched in the us we have a patent in the us covering tobi that will extend until collaborative agreement revenues we recognize collaborative agreement revenues for fees received as we perform research services and achieve specified milestones 
our biopharmaceuticals segment recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
s bio in the second quarter  we invested in a singapore based venture  s bio pte ltd  to research and develop therapeutic  diagnostic  vaccine and antibody products see liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash investing activities below 
we also granted s bio certain rights to our gene expression and combinatorial chemistry technology 
under this arrangement  we received approximately million for technology transfer and research services 
we recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively  under this arrangement 
the technology transfer period and related revenue recognition period ended in the third quarter taisho in the first quarter  we entered into a collaboration agreement with taisho pharmaceutical co  ltd 
to target macrolide mediated gene discovery 
under this arrangement  we recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million and million for and  respectively 
novartis in november  chiron and novartis entered into a consent order with the federal trade commission 
we granted a royalty bearing license to rhone poulenc rorer  inc under certain of our patents related to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene in the field of gene therapy 
chiron and novartis entered into a separate agreement which provided  among other things  for certain cross licenses between chiron and novartis  and under which novartis paid us million over five years 
in connection with this agreement  we recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million in and this agreement expired in the fourth quarter under the terms of a november agreement with novartis ag  we granted novartis a license to utilize our combinatorial chemistry techniques 
in exchange for this license  novartis paid us million over a five year period 
in addition  this agreement provided for research funding by novartis  and certain up front milestone and royalty payments  as well as product commercialization rights for both parties 
in  we recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million 
this agreement expired in the fourth quarter our other segment also earned collaborative agreement revenues under a third novartis agreement 
see other collaborative agreement revenues below 
the balance of collaborative agreement revenues recognized in our biopharmaceuticals segment consisted of various other agreements  which individually were not material 
collaborative agreement revenues tend to fluctuate based on the amount and timing of research services performed  the status of projects under collaboration and the achievement of milestones 
due to the nature of our collaborative agreement revenues  results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
in addition  the collaboration agreements typically provide for certain milestone payments and various royalties on future product sales if the collaborative partners commercialize a product using our technology 
however  we have no assurance that the collaborative partners will meet their development objectives or commercialize a product using our technology 
also  our ability to generate additional collaborative agreement revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to initiate and maintain relationships with potential and current collaborative partners 
we have no assurance that new relationships will be established or that current collaborative agreement revenues will not decline 
royalty and license fee revenues our biopharmaceuticals segment earns royalties on third party sales of several products  including betaferon and recombinant insulin and glucagon products 
our biopharmaceuticals segment also earns license fees for technologies  such as hepatitis c virus related patents  used by third parties to develop therapeutic products 
the biopharmaceuticals segment recognized royalty and license fee revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
betaferon we earn royalties on schering ag s sales of betaferon in those cases where we do not supply the product 
in  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  under this arrangement 
the increase in betaferon royalties in compared with was due to i increased utilization of beta interferon therapy for multiple sclerosis  ii fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  principally the euro and iii incremental revenues recognized during the first quarter of million related to a change in our methodology of recognizing these royalties 
prior to  we accounted for betaferon royalties as a percentage of forecast received from schering  with an adjustment of the estimate to actual in the subsequent quarter 
more current information of european betaseron sales was available in  and as a result  we were able to recognize betaferon royalties on a current basis beginning in the first quarter these increases were offset partially by the shift of revenue from royalties to product sales related to switzerland as schering began to sell product purchased in into the market 
as discussed in product sales betaseron above  we began supplying betaferon to schering in the fourth quarter for certain additional european markets  which was previously supplied by boehringer ingelheim 
this resulted in a shift of revenue recognized under this agreement to product sales  with a decrease in royalty revenues  beginning in the fourth quarter the exact shift of revenue in the future will be contingent on our production capacity and market demand and is expected to increase over the next three years 
overall biopharmaceutical earnings is expected to be largely unaffected by the transition 
in addition  under the terms of this agreement  our royalty percentage for betaferon will decrease in the fourth quarter by approximately 
the increases in betaferon in as compared with primarily related to increased utilization of beta interferon therapy for multiple sclerosis  offset by a weaker exchange rate of the euro as compared with the us dollar 
betaferon is the only product that is approved in europe for the treatment of both relapsing remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
foreign currency exchange rates may influence future betaferon royalties 
novo nordisk we earn royalty revenues on insulin and glucagon product sales by novo nordisk as 
we recognized million  million and million in  and  respectively  under this arrangement 
patents related to the production of insulin and glucagons expire beginning late and as a result  significant reductions in royalty revenue recognized under this arrangement are expected 
the balance of royalty and license fee revenues recognized in our biopharmaceuticals segment consisted of various other agreements  which individually were not material 
in  we granted glaxosmithkline plc rights under certain of our mc r compound patents and merck co  inc and abbott laboratories rights under certain of our hepatitis c virus related patents 
in  we granted schering ag rights relating to the technology used in the manufacturing of hirudin  bristol myers squibb company and japan tobacco  inc rights under certain of our hepatitis c virus related patents and eximias pharmaceutical corporation formerly zarix incorporated rights under our recombinant protein technology 
in  we granted glaxo group limited now part of glaxosmithkline plc rights under certain of our hepatitis c virus related patents and resumed phase iv clinical trials for depocyt 
royalty and license fee revenues may fluctuate based on the nature of the related agreements  the timing of receipt of license fees and the expiration of patents 
results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
also  the license agreements typically provide for certain milestone payments and various royalties on future product sales if the licensees commercialize a product using our technology 
however  we have no assurance that the licensees will meet their development objectives or commercialize a product using our technology 
in addition  our ability to generate additional royalty and license fee revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to market and capitalize on our technologies 
we have no assurance that we will be able to do so or that future royalty and license fee revenues will not decline 
other revenues our biopharmaceuticals segment recognized other revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
contract manufacturing revenues our biopharmaceuticals segment recognized contract manufacturing revenues of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the fluctuations in as compared to  and in as compared to  resulted from the level of activity and the timing of contract manufacturing activities 
other in the fourth quarter  we recognized million related to the sale of the us sales and marketing rights for depocyt to skyepharma plc 
in the fourth quarter  we recognized million related to a royalty audit recovery 
as previously announced by schering ag  biogen will make a payment to schering because a us court of appeals partially reversed a district court ruling in connection with the so called mccormick patents owned by schering s us subsidiary  berlex laboratories 
we will share in this payment in accordance with an earlier contract between the parties 
the balance of other revenues recognized in our biopharmaceuticals segment consisted of various other arrangements  which individually were not material 
other revenues recognized in our biopharmaceuticals segment may fluctuate due to the nature of the revenues recognized and the timing of events giving rise to these revenues 
we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining additional revenues or that these revenues will not decline 
gross profit biopharmaceutical gross profit as a percentage of net product sales was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in biopharmaceutical gross profit margins in as compared with was the result of a more favorable mix of biopharmaceutical product sales  price increases taken early in and  a decrease in royalty expenses 
the increase in biopharmaceutical gross profit margins in as compared with primarily related to a more favorable mix of biopharmaceutical product sales  including tobi  offset by a decrease in gross profit margins caused by the timing of betaseron shipments 
we are obligated to pay royalties on sales of certain therapeutic products in the us and in europe to the former limited partners of cetus healthcare limited partnership see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
one of these agreements expired on december  this had a slightly positive impact on gross profit margins in compared to biopharmaceutical gross profit percentages may fluctuate significantly in future periods due to production yields and as the biopharmaceutical product and customer mix changes 
research and development our biopharmaceuticals segment recognized research and development expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development spending in as compared with primarily related to the timing of various clinical trials  including i the conclusion of the clinical trial for tifacogin recombinant tissue factor pathway inhibitor for severe sepsis in the fourth quarter  ii the conclusion of reimbursed manufacturing activities to our partner  ribozyme pharmaceuticals co  for production of angiozyme for clinical trials in cancer and iii the conclusion of our phase i trials for hiv using a non nucleoside hiv reverse transcriptase inhibitor nnrti compound 
the decreases were partially offset by the progress in other development projects  including those activities related to i our december collaboration agreement with nektar therapeutics formerly inhale therapeutic systems  inc for the development of a dry powder formulation of our inhaled tobi product for the treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients  ii the development of tezacitabine  obtained as a part of the acquisition of matrix pharmaceutical in the first quarter and iii the development of interleukin in combination with various monoclonal antibodies 
in addition  as discussed in product sales betaseron above  we are required to make capital improvements to our existing manufacturing facilities to support the supply of betaferon to schering 
in  in connection with this project  we incurred expenses relating to the development of new processes and the performance of test runs related to the installed equipment 
in the fourth quarter  we reached an agreement in principle to transfer responsibility for the silcaat referred to below as proleukin for hiv trial  a phase iii study for recombinant human interleukin il  aldeseleukin  to the investigators  as managed by a scientific committee comprised of researchers affiliated with the hospital henri mondor in paris  the national institutes of health  the university of minnesota  and other research institutions 
the agreement to transfer this study did not have a material impact on research and development expenses for the study  furthermore  research and development expenses for and did not vary significantly 
research and development expenses related to the silcaat trial are expected to decrease in as a result of transferring responsibility for the trial 
however  under the agreement  we are obligated to fund a maximum of million over the next three years to third parties 
the increase in research and development spending in as compared with was due to the furtherance of our clinical trials related to tifacogin recombinant tissue factor pathway inhibitor for severe sepsis  proleukin for hiv and progress in various other development platforms  including those obtained as part of the acquisition of pathogenesis corporation on september  in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with nektar  as discussed above 
the increases were offset by the conclusion of phase ii clinical trials for fibroblast growth factor for coronary and peripheral artery diseases and a reduction in gene therapy activities with the sale of the san diego facility in january see gain loss on sale of assets below 
in addition  certain and research and development expenses have been reallocated between our biopharmaceuticals segment and our vaccines segment to conform with the presentation 
research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of pre clinical and clinical trial related activities 
selling  general and administrative our biopharmaceuticals segment recognized selling  general and administrative expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with related to sales and marketing costs for various biopharmaceutical post market approval commitments and support for continued market penetration of tobi in europe  and costs following the acquisition of pulmopharm in the third quarter the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with primarily was due to the acquisition of pathogenesis corporation  and increased sales and marketing costs related to the relaunch of depocyt in the first quarter selling  general and administrative expenses in also were affected by our worldwide implementation of an integrated information system in april of amortization expense our biopharmaceuticals segment recognized amortization expense of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we acquired pathogenesis corporation on september  and accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated a portion of the purchase price to purchased technologies  acquired intangible assets and goodwill  which related to the biopharmaceuticals segment 
purchased technologies  which were concluded to have alternative future uses  represented the fair value of research and development projects  which we will develop further after the acquisition date 
we are amortizing purchased technologies on a straight line basis over years 
acquired intangible assets included the fair value of trademarks and trade names  patents and databases  which we are amortizing on a straight line basis over to years 
on january   as discussed in new accounting standards below  we implemented sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires  among other things  that the assembled workforce be reclassified to goodwill and that goodwill including assembled workforce no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with this statement 
this change was the primary reason for the decrease in amortization expense in as compared with as circumstances dictate  we evaluate the useful life and value of each intangible asset  which may result in future adjustments to the amortization periods or carrying values 
goodwill including assembled workforce amortization expense was million and million in and  respectively 
vaccines product sales we sell meningococcal  flu  travel and pediatric vaccines in germany  italy  the united kingdom and other international markets 
vaccine product sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
menjugate  our conjugate vaccine against meningococcal meningitis caused by the bacterium n 
meningitidis serogroup c  sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in there were  as expected  fewer shipments to existing markets than in and  partially offset by shipments to new markets 
the and activity related to a tender with the national health service in the united kingdom  for a universal vaccination program 
in there were significant shipments as we shipped million of menjugate under this tender 
this tender was completed in the activity also included shipments to canada  the commencement of which occurred in the second quarter sales of our flu vaccines were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in flu vaccine sales in as compared with resulted from being first to the market in germany  increased sales to new countries  such as china  increased sales to existing countries due to increased awareness in the overall influenza vaccines market and improved production yields 
flu vaccine sales increased in as compared with primarily as the result of being first to the german market 
sales of our travel vaccines were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
contributing to the increase in travel vaccine sales as compared with  were increased tick borne encephalitis vaccine sales with the launch of a new adult formulation and a pediatric formulation in germany 
contributing to the increase in travel vaccine sales as compared with were increased i tick borne encephalitis vaccine sales  attributed to regulatory difficulties of a competitor s product and ii rabies vaccine sales  due to greater market penetration 
sales of our pediatric vaccines were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
contributing to the increase in pediatric other vaccines sales as compared with were increased polio vaccine sales to non profit organizations and developing markets such as india 
certain of our vaccine products  particularly our flu vaccines  are seasonal and typically have higher sales in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
in addition  we expect menjugate sales to continue to fluctuate as public health authorities consider adoption of broad vaccination programs 
we are currently initiating plans for a registration trial in the us for menjugate and expect to begin this phase iii trial in we are exploring opportunities for additional menjugate sales in other countries 
we expect competitive pressures related to many of our vaccine products to continue into the future  primarily as a result of the introduction of competing products into the market  including  but not limited to  new combination vaccines  as listed in part i  item  business competition above

hoffmann laroche limited litigation in october and lower payroll taxes related to stock option exercises during a period of lower average chiron stock prices 
in march  we posted an all time high in our stock price 
the fourth quarter also included costs associated with the integration of pathogenesis corporation 
write off of purchased in process technologies the write off of purchased in process technologies was million and million in and  respectively 
there was no write off of purchased in process technologies in on february   we acquired matrix pharmaceutical  inc and accounted for the acquisition as an asset purchase 
we allocated the purchase price based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we allocated a portion of the purchase price to purchased in process technologies and wrote off million in we do not anticipate that there will be any alternative future use for the in process technologies that were written off 
in valuing the purchased in process technologies  we used probability of success adjusted cash flows and a discount rate 
we assumed revenue from tezacitabine to commence after as with all pharmaceutical products  the probability of commercial success for any research and development project is highly uncertain 
on september   we acquired pathogenesis corporation and accounted for the acquisition as a business combination using the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated a portion of the purchase price to purchased in process technologies for million 
we wrote this off entirely in the fourth quarter the write off of purchased in process technologies represented the fair value at the acquisition date  calculated utilizing the income approach  of the portion of certain in process research and development projects that were not reliant upon core technology 
core technology represents technology that has been utilized in approved or commercialized products 
we did not include certain research and development projects deemed too early in terms of completion metrics and any future yet to be defined technologies in the calculation of in process technologies 
we do not anticipate that there will be any alternative future use for the in process technologies that were written off 
in valuing the purchased in process technologies  we used probability of success adjusted cash flows and a discount rate 
we assumed cash inflows from any one in process product to commence between and based on current information  we believe that the revenue projections underlying the purchase price allocation are substantially accurate 
as with all pharmaceutical products  the probability of commercial success for any one research and development project is highly uncertain 
restructuring and reorganization we previously recorded restructuring and reorganization charges related to i the integration of our worldwide vaccines operations  ii the closure of our puerto rico and st

the charge reversal of million primarily related to revised estimates of termination and other employee related costs recorded in connection with the retention of of the positions 
as described above  we adjusted the number of positions for elimination to  of which had terminated as of december  the charge of million primarily related to revised estimates of facility related costs 
we expect to substantially settle the restructuring and reorganization accruals within one to six years of accruing the related charges 
we expect employee and facility related cost savings due to these restructuring activities in cost of sales  research and development expense and selling  general and administrative expense through we believe that we have begun to achieve these cost savings

in income taxes the reported effective tax rate for is of pretax income from continuing operations  including the write off of purchased in process technologies related to the matrix pharmaceutical acquisition 
the write off of purchased in process technologies in is not tax deductible 
the adjusted annual effective tax rate for is of pretax income from continuing operations  excluding the write off of purchased in process technologies 
the reported effective tax rate is slightly higher than the reported effective tax rate due to the write off of non deductible in process technologies incurred in  which outweighed the increased benefits realized in from foreign income taxed at rates lower than the us tax rate and the absence of non deductible goodwill amortization in pursuant to sfas no 
 as discussed above 
in  non deductible goodwill amortization increased the reported effective tax rate

referred to as fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities which addresses the accounting for certain off balance sheet lease financing 
the recognition provisions of fin no 
will be effective for chiron for the interim period ended september  as chiron finalizes the options discussed in note  commitments and contingencies by july   chiron will continue to monitor the impact of fin no 
on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued emerging issues task force referred to as eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a company for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf issue no 
addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance with respect to the effect of certain customer rights due to company nonperformance on the recognition of revenue allocated to delivered units of accounting 
eitf issue no 
also addresses the impact on the measurement and or allocation of arrangement consideration of customer cancellation provisions and consideration that varies as a result of future actions of the customer or the company 
finally  eitf issue no 
provides guidance with respect to the recognition of the cost of certain deliverables that are excluded from the revenue accounting for an arrangement 
the provisions of eitf issue no

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force referred to as eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  not at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan  as required under eitf issue no 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized under such costs  and is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements

 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that the assembled workforce be reclassified to goodwill and that goodwill including assembled workforce and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with sfas no 
chiron adopted the provisions of sfas no 
immediately  and sfas no 
effective january  sfas no 
required  upon adoption of sfas no 
 chiron to evaluate existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a purchase business combination prior to june   and make any necessary reclassifications to conform with the new criteria in sfas no 
as a result  chiron reclassified assembled workforce with a net carrying value of million to goodwill on january  upon adoption of sfas no 
 chiron reassessed the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets excluding goodwill and assembled workforce acquired in purchase business combinations 
no adjustments to amortization periods were necessary 
chiron has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the adoption of sfas no 
requires chiron to assess whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of january  to accomplish this  chiron identified its reporting units as of january  chiron then determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  chiron subsequently determined the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of expected future cash flows and compared it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
each reporting unit s fair value exceeds its carrying amount 
based on this analysis  chiron has no indication of a transitional impairment loss and no further analysis is required 
in addition  as mandated by sfas no 
 chiron must perform an impairment test at least annually 
any impairment loss from the annual test will be recognized as part of operations 
chiron performed its annual impairment test as of june  and has no indication of an impairment loss and no further analysis is required 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires liability recognition for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
chiron adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
under sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  chiron evaluated the recoverability of its intangible and long lived assets excluding goodwill  as circumstances dictated 
impairment  if any  was based on the excess of the carrying value of such assets over their respective fair values  calculated based upon the projected discounted net cash flows associated with such assets 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 in that it excludes goodwill from its impairment scope and allows for different approaches in cash flow estimation 
however  sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for recognition and measurement of the impairment of a long lived assets to be held and used and b long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas no 
also supercedes the business segment concept in accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  in that it permits presentation of a component of an entity  whether classified as held for sale or disposed of  as a discontinued operation 
however  sfas no 
retains the requirement of accounting principles board opinion no 
to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations 
chiron adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  the implementation of the impairment provisions of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements

p   total we lease laboratory  office and manufacturing facilities  land and equipment under noncancelable operating leases  which expire through future minimum lease payments  including those for the leaseback of office and warehouse space in the amsterdam facility  are estimated to be approximately million in the aggregate 
in june  we entered into a seven year agreement with a group of financial institutions which we will refer to as the lessors in this section to lease a research and development facility 
construction was completed on this facility in the total cost of the facility covered by this lease was million 
we account for this lease as an operating lease and  as a result  record neither an asset nor a liability on our balance sheet 
the future minimum lease payments stated in above include only million for the first six months of our annual lease payments represent variable rate interest payments indexed to the london interbank offered rate on the million lease financing 
since the lease payments are clearly and closely related to the host contract the lease agreement  in this case  this lease transaction is not subject to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
for tax purposes  the lease is considered a capital lease the annual lease payments are characterized as interest expense with the tax depreciation on the facility reducing our taxable income and  therefore  our current tax liability 
the lease provides a million residual value guarantee from chiron to the lessors in the event of property value declines 
based upon the current local real estate market  we believe that our research and development facility has not experienced a property value decline 
however  we have no assurance that the property value will not decline between now and the termination of the lease on or before july  consequently  our maximum payment obligation is million upon termination of the lease on or before july  on or before july   we can choose to either purchase the facility from the lessors or sell the facility to a third party 
this option accelerates if we default on our lease payments 
if we purchase the facility  we must pay the lessors million  record the facility on our balance sheet at its cost and depreciate it over the remaining estimated useful life of the facility 
in addition  if we finance the purchase of the facility  we would incur interest expense 
if we sell the facility on the designated sale date  the sales proceeds would be distributed as follows to the lessors for their residual interest in the cost of the facility cost of the facility less the residual value guarantee or million  and to chiron for amounts paid under the residual value guarantee on or before july  if we do not sell the facility by the designated sale date  the lessors may market the facility for sale 
when the lessors sell the facility  the sales proceeds first would be distributed to the lessors for marketing and operating costs  then in the order as indicated in the previous sentence 
if the facility is sold for more than million  we receive the remaining proceeds and  possibly  recognize a gain 
likewise  if the facility is sold for less than million  we recognize a loss up to the residual value guarantee 
as of december   novartis ag had guaranteed under provisions of the investment agreement payments on this lease commitment  including payment of the residual value guarantee  to a maximum of million 
credit rating agencies treat this operating lease as debt

there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at december  and market risk management our cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  the fair value of equity securities held and our stock price 
we attempt to limit our exposure to some or all of these market risks through the use of various financial instruments 
these activities are discussed in further detail in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
factors that may affect future results as a global pharmaceutical company  we are engaged in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business 
the forward looking statements contained in this k and in other periodic reports  press releases and other statements issued by us from time to time reflect our current beliefs and expectations concerning objectives  plans  strategies  future performance and other future events 
the following discussion highlights some of the factors  many of which are beyond our control  which could cause actual results to differ 
promising technologies ultimately may not prove successful we focus our research and development activities on areas in which we have particular strengths and on technologies that appear promising 
these technologies often are on the cutting edge of modern science 
as a result  the outcome of any research or development program is highly uncertain 
only a very small fraction of these programs ultimately result in commercial products or even product candidates 
product candidates that initially appear promising often fail to yield successful products 
in many cases  preclinical or clinical studies will show that a product candidate is not efficacious that is  it lacks the intended therapeutic or prophylactic effect  or that it raises safety concerns or has other side effects  which outweigh the intended benefit 
success in preclinical or early clinical trials which generally focus on safety issues may not translate into success in large scale clinical trials which are designed to show efficacy  often for reasons that are not fully understood 
further  success in clinical trials will likely lead to increased investment  adversely affecting short term profitability  to bring such products to market 
and even after a product is approved and launched  general usage or post marketing studies may identify safety or other previously unknown problems with the product which may result in regulatory approvals being suspended  limited to narrow indications or revoked  or which may otherwise prevent successful commercialization 
regulatory standards we must obtain and maintain regulatory approval in order to market most of our products 
generally  these approvals are on a product by product and country by country basis 
in the case of therapeutic products  a separate approval is required for each therapeutic indication 
see part i  item business government regulation above 
product candidates that appear promising based on early  and even large scale  clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval 
the results of clinical trials often are susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent approval or result in the need for post marketing studies 
in addition  regulations may be amended from time to time 
revised regulations may require us to reformulate products on a country or regional basis  obtain additional regulatory approvals  or accept additional risks that our products will not maintain market acceptance or be eligible for third party insurance coverage 
increased regulatory scrutiny and restrictions regarding marketing practices for products that are subject to government reimbursement may impact the sales of such products 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to satisfy these new regulatory requirements and may suffer a loss of revenue as a result 
manufacturing most of our products are biologics 
manufacturing biologic products is complex 
unlike chemical pharmaceuticals  a biologic product generally cannot be sufficiently characterized in terms of its physical and chemical properties to rely on assaying of the finished product alone to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner 
accordingly  it is essential to be able to both validate and control the manufacturing process  that is  to show that the process works and that the product is made strictly and consistently in compliance with that process 
slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process  including quality control  labeling and packaging  may result in unacceptable changes in the products that may result in lot failures or product recalls 
manufacturing processes which are used to produce the smaller quantities of material needed for research and development purposes may not be successfully scaled up to allow production of commercial quantities at reasonable cost or at all 
all of these difficulties are compounded when dealing with novel biologic products that require novel manufacturing processes 
additionally  manufacturing is subject to extensive government regulation 
even minor changes in the manufacturing process require regulatory approval  which  in turn  may require further clinical studies 
for some of our products we rely on others to supply raw materials and to manufacture those products according to regulatory requirements 
in addition  any prolonged interruption in our operations or those of our partners could result in cancellations of shipments 
a number of factors could cause interruptions  including equipment malfunctions or failures  damage to a facility due to natural disasters  such as an earthquake  suspension of power supplied to these facilities arising out of regional power shortages or terrorist activities and armed conflict  including as a result of the disruption of operations of our subsidiaries and our customers  suppliers  distributors  couriers  collaborative partners  licensees and clinical trial sites 
mishandling of hazardous materials could result in substantial costs in connection with our research and manufacturing activities  we utilize some hazardous materials 
great care is taken to ensure we have appropriate procedures and permits in place for storing and handling such hazardous materials 
we could be subject to loss of our permits  government fines or penalties and or other adverse governmental action if such hazardous materials are stored  handled or released into the environment in violation of law or any permit 
a substantial fine or penalty  the payment of significant environmental remediation costs or the loss of a permit or other authorization to operate or engage in our ordinary course of business could materially adversely affect our business 
reliance on third party manufacturers we use raw materials and other supplies that generally are available from multiple commercial sources 
certain manufacturing processes  however  use materials that are available from sole sources  or that are in short supply  or are difficult for the supplier to produce and certify in accordance with our specifications 
from time to time  concerns are raised with respect to potential contamination of biological materials that are supplied to us 
these concerns can further tighten market conditions for materials that may be in short supply or available from limited sources 
moreover  regulatory approvals to market our products may be conditioned upon obtaining certain materials from specified sources 
our ability to substitute material from an alternate source may be delayed pending regulatory approval of such alternate source 
although we work to mitigate the risks associated with relying on sole suppliers  there is a possibility that material shortages could impact production 
chiron purchases bulk powdered tobramycin  the primary basic raw material in tobi  from two of the principal worldwide suppliers of the drug 
chiron anticipates that either one of these suppliers alone will be able to supply sufficient quantities to meet current needs  however  there can be no assurance that these suppliers will be able to meet future demand in a timely and cost effective manner 
as a result  chiron s operations could be adversely affected by an interruption or reduction in the supply of bulk powdered tobramycin 
chiron has entered into contracts with third parties for the production and packaging of tobi 
over time  chiron can use alternative production and packaging sources 
however  if the contracted third parties become unable to produce or package sufficient quantities of tobi due to work stoppages or other factors  chiron s operations could be disrupted until alternative sources are secured 
we are a key provider for the blood screening field of nucleic acid testing and immunodiagnostics 
in nucleic acid testing  we rely on our collaborative partner  gen probe to manufacture the procleix hiv hcv assay  we currently source the related instrument system from third party suppliers 
currently  gen probe is the only manufacturer of nucleic acid testing products using transcription mediated amplification technology 
in immunodiagnostics  under the ortho clinical diagnostics  inc contract  we manufacture bulk reagents and antigens and confirmatory test kits sold in the clinical diagnostics and blood screening fields 
while we and our partners work to mitigate the risks associated with being a key provider  there can be no assurance that our partner  gen probe will be able to provide sufficient quantities of the procleix hiv hcv assay or that we will be able to manufacture sufficient bulk reagents and antigens and confirmatory test kits for immunodiagnostic products 
our difficulties or delays or those of our partners could cause a public health concern for the blood supply  as well as increase costs and cause loss of revenue or market share 
patents held by third parties may delay or prevent commercialization third parties  including competitors  have patents and patent applications in the us and other significant markets that may be useful or necessary for the manufacture  use or sale of certain products and products in development by us and our corporate partners 
it is likely that third parties will obtain these patents in the future 
certain of these patents may be broad enough to prevent or delay us and our corporate partners from manufacturing or marketing products important to our current and future business 
we cannot accurately predict the scope  validity and enforceability of these patents  if granted  the extent to which we may wish or need to obtain licenses to these patents  and the cost and availability of these licenses 
if we do not or cannot obtain these licenses  products may be withdrawn from the market or delays could be encountered in market introduction while an attempt is made to design around these patents  or we could find that the development  manufacture or sale of such products is foreclosed 
we could also incur substantial costs in licensing or challenging the validity and scope of these patents 
product acceptance we may experience difficulties in launching new products  many of which are novel products based on technologies that are unfamiliar to the healthcare community 
we have no assurance that healthcare providers and patients will accept such products 
in addition  government agencies  as well as private organizations involved in healthcare  from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers and patients 
such guidelines or recommendations can be very influential and may adversely affect the usage of our products directly for example  by recommending a decreased dosage of our product in conjunction with a concomitant therapy or indirectly for example  by recommending a competitive product over our product 
product liability we are exposed to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects 
while we will continue to take precautions  we may not avoid significant product liability exposure 
although we maintain product liability insurance  there is no guarantee that this coverage will be sufficient 
it is not feasible to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain products and we are self insured in relation to these products 
if we are sued for any injury caused by our products  we could suffer a significant financial loss 
as we are a key provider for the blood screening field of nucleic acid testing and immunodiagnostics  we may have product liability exposure  in the event that our difficulties or delays or those of our partners could cause a public health concern for the blood supply 
competition we operate in a highly competitive environment  and the competition is expected to increase 
competitors include large pharmaceutical  chemical and blood testing companies  and biotechnology companies 
some of these competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical and blood testing companies  have greater resources than ours 
accordingly  even if we are successful in launching a product  we may find that a competitive product dominates the market for any number of reasons  including the possibility that the competitor may have launched its product first  the competitor may have greater access to certain raw materials  the competitor may have more efficient manufacturing processes  the competitor may adapt more quickly to technological change  the competitor may have greater marketing capabilities  or the competitive product may have therapeutic or other advantages 
the technologies applied by our competitors and us are rapidly evolving  and new developments frequently result in price competition and product obsolescence 
in addition  we may be impacted by competition from generic forms of our products or substitute products 
specific to one product  tobi  a generic form of this product may be available from our competitors  which may cause loss of revenue or market share 
chiron s patents may not prevent competition or generate revenues we seek to obtain patents on many of our inventions 
without the protection of patents  competitors may be able to use our inventions to manufacture and market competing products without being required to undertake the lengthy and expensive development efforts made by us and without having to pay royalties or otherwise compensate us for the use of the invention 
we have no assurance that patents and patent applications owned or licensed to us will provide substantial protection 
important legal questions remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of available patent protection for biotechnology products and processes in the us and other important markets 
we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will be granted  or the effective coverage of those that are granted 
in the us and other important markets  the issuance of a patent is neither conclusive as to its validity nor the enforceable scope of its claims 
we have engaged in significant litigation to determine the scope and validity of certain of our patents and expect to continue to do so 
an adverse outcome of litigation could result in the reduction or loss of royalty revenues 
engaging in patent litigation against one party may place significant royalty revenues received or to be received from other parties at risk 
even if we are successful in obtaining and defending patents  there can be no assurance that these patents will provide substantial protection 
the length of time necessary to resolve patent litigation successfully may allow infringers to gain significant market advantage 
third parties may be able to design around the patents and develop competitive products that do not use the inventions covered by our patents 
many countries  including certain countries in europe  have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties for example  the third party s product is needed to meet a threat to public health or safety in that country  or the patent owner has failed to work the invention in that country  or the third party has patented improvements 
in addition  most countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors 
in these countries  the patent owner may be limited to monetary relief and may be unable to enjoin infringement  which could materially diminish the value of the patent 
in addition  royalty revenues will decline as patents expire 
availability of reimbursement  government and other pressures on pricing in the us and other significant markets  sales of our products may be affected by the availability of reimbursement from the government or other third parties  such as insurance companies 
it is difficult to predict the reimbursement status of newly approved  novel biotechnology products  and current reimbursement policies for existing products may change 
in certain foreign markets  governments have issued regulations relating to the pricing and profitability of pharmaceutical companies 
there have been proposals in the us at both the federal and state level to implement such controls 
the growth of managed care in the us also has placed pressure on the pricing of healthcare products 
these pressures can be expected to continue 
costs associated with expanding the business we expect to grow our business in areas in which we can be most competitive  either through in licensing  collaborations or acquisitions of products or companies 
in connection with these efforts  we may incur significant charges  costs and expenses which could impact our profitability  including impairment losses  restructuring charges  the write off of purchased in process technologies  transaction related expenses  costs associated with integrating new businesses and the cost of amortizing goodwill and other intangibles 
some transactions may require the consent of our stockholders or a third party  or the approval by various regulatory authorities 
we have no assurance that such in licensing  collaborations or acquisitions will be successful 
other new products and sources of revenue many products in our current pipeline are in relatively early stages of research or development 
our ability to grow earnings in the near to medium term may depend  in part  on our ability to initiate and maintain other revenue generating relationships with third parties  such as licenses to certain of our technologies  and on our ability to identify and successfully acquire rights to later stage products from third parties 
we have no assurance that we will establish such other sources of revenue 
interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we have significant cash balances and investments 
our financial results  therefore  are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
in addition  we sell products in many countries throughout the world  and our financial results could be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or by weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
corporate partners an important part of our business strategy depends upon collaborations with third parties  including research collaborations and joint efforts to develop and commercialize new products 
as circumstances change  chiron and our corporate partners may develop conflicting priorities or other conflicts of interest 
we may experience significant delays and incur significant expenses in resolving these conflicts and may not be able to resolve these matters on acceptable terms 
even without conflicts of interest  we may disagree with our corporate partners as to how best to realize the value associated with a current product or a product in development 
in some cases  the corporate partner may have responsibility for formulating and implementing key strategic or operational plans 
in addition  merger and acquisition activity within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may affect our corporate partners  causing them to reprioritize their efforts related to the research collaborations and other joint efforts with us 
decisions by corporate partners on key clinical  regulatory  marketing including pricing  inventory management and other issues may prevent successful commercialization of the product or otherwise impact our profitability 
our relationship with novartis ag could limit our ability to enter into transactions  pursue opportunities in conflict with novartis and cause the price of our common stock to decline we have an alliance with novartis ag  a life sciences company headquartered in basel  switzerland 
under a series of agreements between chiron and novartis  and as a result of subsequent stock issuances by chiron  novartis ownership interest in chiron is approximately as of december  the governance agreement between chiron and novartis contains provisions that require the approval of novartis before we enter into certain corporate transactions 
these transactions generally include significant debt or equity issuances  debt or equity repurchases  most mergers and acquisitions  the payment of cash dividends  amendments to chiron s certificate of incorporation or by laws  and other transactions that would adversely impact the rights of novartis  or discriminate against novartis  as a chiron stockholder 
in addition  a majority of the independent directors must approve any material transactions between chiron and novartis 
these provisions may limit our ability to enter into transactions with third parties otherwise viewed as beneficial to chiron 
all of our shares owned by novartis are eligible for sale in the public market subject to compliance with the applicable securities laws 
we have agreed that  upon novartis request  we will file one or more registration statements under the securities act in order to permit novartis to offer and sell shares of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by novartis in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
for more information on our relationship with novartis  see note related party transactions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
stock price volatility the price of our stock  like that of other pharmaceutical companies  is subject to significant volatility 
any number of events  both internal and external to us  may affect our stock price 
these include  without limitation  fluctuations in earnings from period to period  results of clinical trials conducted by us or by our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors regarding product development efforts  including the status of regulatory approval applications  the outcome of legal proceedings  including claims filed by us against third parties to enforce our patents and claims filed by third parties against us relating to patents held by the third parties  the launch of competing products  the resolution of or failure to resolve disputes with corporate partners  corporate restructuring by us  licensing activities by us  and the acquisition or sale by us of products  products in development or businesses 
in connection with our research and development collaborations  from time to time we may invest in equity securities of our corporate partners 
the price of these securities also is subject to significant volatility and may be affected by  among other things  the types of events that affect our stock 
changes in the market price of these securities may impact our profitability 
income taxes we are taxable principally in the us  germany  italy and the netherlands 
all of these jurisdictions have in the past and may in the future make changes to their corporate tax rates and other tax laws  which could increase our future tax provision 
we have negotiated a number of rulings regarding income and other taxes that are subject to periodic review and renewal 
if such rulings are not renewed or are substantially modified  income taxes payable in particular jurisdictions could increase 
while we believe that all material tax liabilities are reflected properly in our balance sheet  we are presently under audit in several jurisdictions and may be subject to further audits in the future  and we have no assurance that we will prevail in all cases in the event the taxing authorities disagree with our interpretations of the tax law 
in addition  we have assumed liabilities for all income taxes incurred prior to the sales of our former subsidiaries  chiron vision subject to certain limitations and chiron diagnostics 
future levels of research and development spending  capital investment and export sales will impact our entitlement to related tax credits and benefits which have the effect of lowering our effective tax rate 
earnings volatility our operating results may vary considerably from quarter to quarter 
any number of factors may affect our quarterly operating results 
these factors include  but are not limited to the following  inventory management practices  including wholesale ordering patterns  the level of pre clinical and clinical trial related activities  seasonality of certain vaccine products  the tender driven nature of certain vaccine products  in particular menjugate  the nature of our collaborative  royalty and license arrangements and other revenue sources  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and the level of product reserves due to various issues  including seasonality patterns  excess and obsolete inventory  and production yields 
our results in any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full year 
accounting standards  financial reporting and corporate governance requirements and tax laws we must follow accounting standards  financial reporting and corporate governance requirements and tax laws set by the governing bodies and lawmakers in the us and other countries where we do business 
from time to time  these governing bodies and lawmakers implement new and revised rules and laws 
these new and revised accounting standards  financial reporting and corporate governance requirements and tax laws may require changes to our financial statements  the composition of our board of directors  the composition  the responsibility and manner of operation of various board level committees  the information filed by us with the governing bodies and enforcement of tax laws against us 
implementing changes required by such new standards  requirements or laws likely will require a significant expenditure of time  attention and resources  especially by our senior management 
it is impossible to predict the impact  if any  on chiron of future changes to accounting standards  financial reporting and corporate governance requirements and tax laws 
in addition  it is possible that the application of certain current accounting standards may change due to environmental factors  which may necessitate a change in our standard practice related to these accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk a significant portion of our operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in western european countries 
as a result  our financial results may be affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of those countries 
our primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is associated with the value of the euro 
an increase in the value of the us dollar vis vis the euro will result in a lower value of our non us dollar based revenues 
to manage foreign currency exchange risks  we enter into forward foreign currency contracts and purchase foreign currency option contracts 
we do not use any of these derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the total notional principal amount of these derivative financial instruments at december  and was million and million  respectively 
we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies 
typically  these contracts have maturities of three months or less 
at december   these exposures amounted to million and were partially offset by forward foreign currency contracts with a notional principal amount of million fair value of million 
the notional principal amount of the forward foreign currency contracts was million fair value of million at december  based on exposures at december   a adverse movement against our portfolio of transaction exposures and hedge contracts would result in a gain of approximately million 
a movement in the value of the dollar versus our portfolio of transaction exposures has occurred once in the last quarters  in the second quarter foreign currency transaction gains from continuing operations  including the impact of hedging  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  we hedged a portion of our exposure to the british pound related to menjugate sales 
we settled this forward foreign currency contract upon substantial conclusion of menjugate sales in the united kingdom in the second quarter the settlement resulted in a gain of approximately million  which we recorded in other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
we may selectively hedge anticipated currency exposures by purchasing foreign currency option contracts 
our primary anticipated exposures are related to foreign revenues received from selling products in western european countries 
to limit hedging costs  we generally purchase out of the money foreign currency option contracts 
at december   anticipated exposures associated with certain euro denominated revenues amounted to million and were partially offset by foreign currency option contracts with a notional principal amount of million fair value of million 
the notional principal amount of the foreign currency option contracts was million fair value of million at december  based on exposures at december   a adverse movement against our portfolio of anticipated transaction exposures and hedge contracts would result in a loss of approximately million 
a movement in the value of the dollar versus our portfolio of anticipated transaction exposures has occurred once in the last quarters  in the second quarter interest rate risk we have exposure to changes in interest rates in both our investment portfolio and certain floating rate liabilities and lease commitments with interest rates tied to the london interbank offered rate 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our liquid yield option notes because the liquid yield option notes bear interest at fixed rates 
we run the risk that if market rates decline  our interest expense incurred on our liquid yield option notes will exceed interest based on the current market rate 
our investment portfolio amounted to approximately  million at december  as of that date  we also had million of floating rate obligations tied to the london interbank offered rate 
we have a natural hedge against this exposure as a result of our portfolio holdings in floating rate fixed income securities tied to the london interbank offered rate 
the analysis below focuses on the impact of changes in interest rates to us and is based on a net portfolio balance of  million 
the analysis assumes an immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points and examines the impact to us over the next twelve months 
an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points results in higher interest income over the month period  partially offset by an immediate decline in the market value of securities held 
the net impact of this scenario is an estimated increase in reported income of million over the month period 
similarly  a basis point decrease results in a decrease in reported income of million 
the impact on reported earnings would be greater given that unrealized changes in the value of the portfolio are reported in comprehensive income 
we currently do not hedge these exposures 
a basis point movement in the federal funds rate has occurred in two of the last ten years  a basis point movement has occurred in three of the last ten years  and a basis point movement has occurred in six of the last ten years 
equity securities risk we have exposure to equity price risk because of our investments in equity securities 
typically  we obtain these securities through our collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners 
we classify a majority of these securities as available for sale and  consequently  record them on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of comprehensive income or loss 
we periodically review the carrying values of these securities 
we recognize other than temporary losses against earnings in the same period the loss was deemed to have occurred 
changes in share prices affect the value of our equity portfolio 
to reduce this risk  we hedged a portion of our exposure through forward sales contracts 
the forward sales contracts substantially offset the long position and  in effect  neutralize the impact of market valuation shifts on the hedged securities 
the notional principal amount of our forward sales contracts at december  was million fair value of million 
a lower fair value indicates a gain since we sold the shares forward at higher prices 
the notional principal amount of our forward sales contracts at december  was million fair value of million 
in the future  we may use additional hedging strategies in order to mitigate the potential adverse impact from changes in the market value of stock prices 
we have no assurance that other than temporary losses will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 
we recorded charges of million and million in and  to write down certain available for sale equity securities for which we deemed the decline in fair value to be other than temporary 
we recorded no charges in at december   if the market price of our equity investments  including warrants  decreased by  the market value of the equity portfolio would decrease by million 
counterparty risk we manage the risk of counterparty default on our debt securities and derivative financial instruments through the use of credit standards  counterparty diversification and monitoring of counterparty financial condition 
we execute debt securities and derivative financial instruments with financial institutions and other issuers with strong credit ratings  which minimizes risk of loss due to nonpayment or deterioration in credit rating 
in  we recorded a charge of million to write down debt securities with a face value of million due to the decline in the credit rating of the issuer 
on march   the issuer paid us the full principal plus interest 
we have not experienced any other losses due to counterparty default
