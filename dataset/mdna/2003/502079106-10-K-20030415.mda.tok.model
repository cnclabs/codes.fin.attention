item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  the company was not in compliance with certain of these restrictive financial covenants at december  in april  the company obtained a waiver of these violations and an amendment of its credit facility  which among other things  provided new financial and non financial covenants for to more accurately track the current financial performance and internal forecasts of the company 
in addition to the above described credit facility  the company has executed various notes in favor of third parties other than the company s primary lender 
the company has executed a note in favor of a former owner of versaform corporation  now a director of the company  in connection with the company s purchase of versaform 
this note is secured by a pledge of of the company s interest in its canadian subsidiary  and as part of its obligations under this note  the company s canadian subsidiary is subject to various restrictive covenants relating to the financial performance of the company s canadian subsidiary 
if the company were to fail in the future to comply with the restrictive covenants in the amended credit facility or in the promissory note  the company s operations and the company s ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities could be negatively affected 
moreover  the company s failure to comply with these restrictive financial and other covenants could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could cause the company to be required to repay its borrowings before their due date 
if the company were unable to make this repayment or otherwise refinance these borrowings  the company s creditors could foreclose on the assets securing its borrowings 
the company s outstanding indebtedness may adversely impact the company s cash flow and ability to raise necessary capital 
the existence of the company s outstanding indebtedness could limit the company s ability to obtain additional financing and will require that significant portions of the company s cash flows from its business operations be used to service outstanding obligations on such indebtedness 
if the company is unable to obtain necessary financing in the future and the diversion of the company s cash flows are used to service debt obligations  the company may have limited ability to fund i working capital requirements  ii future acquisitions that would benefit the company s growth strategy  iii capital expenditures  iv debt service requirements  and v other general business requirements 
the company s business is dependent on only a few customers 
in  of the company s aggregate sales were dependent on relationships with four major customers boeing  lockheed martin  gulfstream and cymer 
although a majority of the company s sales are made pursuant to multi year contracts  such contracts are generally terminable upon days notice by the customer and typically do not require the customer to purchase any specific quantity of products 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that sales to customers that have in the past accounted for significant sales individually or as a group will continue  or if continued  will reach or exceed historical levels in any future periods 
the loss of any one of these customers  or a significant reduction in the amount of orders received from any one of these customers  could cause a significant decrease in the company s net sales and profitability 
the company anticipates that a small number of large customers will continue to dominate its sales for the foreseeable future 
the company s business is dependent on the aerospace industry and is therefore susceptible to factors that affect that industry such as acts of terrorism and general economic factors 
the company derives approximately of its sales and operating income from the services and components sold to the aerospace industry 
as a result of the events of september   the commercial airline industry has suffered a significant decline in operational efficiency and financial condition 
consequently  the company experienced a decrease in orders for new commercial aircraft and replacement components 
the company is unable to predict when the financial outlook of the airline industry might rebound  or when orders for new aircraft and replacement components might increase 
and while in some instances since september  the company has seen an increase in orders from certain customers  particularly producers of military and corporate and regional aircraft  the overall effect of a prolonged downturn in the commercial airline industry will be a potentially severe reduction in demand for the company s aerospace products 
additional acts of sabotage or terrorism or adverse results to the us in its military conflicts  such as the current conflict in iraq  would likely lead to even further reduced demand for the company s products and services 
in addition  the company s business is directly affected by certain characteristics and trends of the aerospace industry that affect its customers  such as i fluctuations in the aerospace industry s business cycle  ii varying fuel and labor costs  iii intense price competition and regulatory scrutiny  iv certain trends including a possible decrease in aviation activity  a decrease in outsourcing by aircraft manufacturers or the failure of projected market growth to materialize or continue  and v changes in military budgeting and procurement for certain military aircraft 
in the event that these characteristics and trends adversely affect customers in the aerospace industry  they would reduce the overall demand for the company s products and services  thereby decreasing the company s sales and operating income 
the company may experience cost over runs related to orders for new products and changes to existing products 
the company generally sells its products under firm  fixed priced contracts providing for a fixed price for the products sold by the company  regardless of the production costs incurred by the company 
as a result  inaccurate pricing  manufacturing inefficiencies  start up costs and other factors may result in cost over runs and losses on contracts 
the cost of producing products also may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor  materials  overhead and changing product standards 
in many cases  the company makes multiyear firm  fixed price commitments to its customers  without assurance that the company s anticipated production costs will be achieved 
in some instances  the company has been successful in obtaining the agreement of a customer to reprice a particular product and recoup previous losses  primarily when incomplete or inaccurate engineering data or out of tolerance tooling has contributed to these cost over runs 
with respect to future claims there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining the necessary re pricing in order to make a particular product profitable to the company 
risks associated with acquisitions could result in increased costs and production inefficiencies 
a key element of the company s growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of complementary businesses involved in the aerospace industry and strategic acquisitions that would provide the company with access to new industries 
the company s ability to expand by acquisition is dependent upon  and may be limited by  the availability of suitable acquisition candidates and the company s capital resources 
acquisition risks include assimilation of the operations and personnel of acquired companies  difficulties associated with new product lines and meeting new tolerance requirements  an inability to accurately price new products  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies  the incurrence of substantial  additional indebtedness in funding such acquisitions  and goodwill impairment 
furthermore  although the company will investigate the business operations and assets of entities that it acquires  there may be liabilities that the company fails or is unable to discover  and for which the company as a successor owner or operator may be liable 
the company evaluates acquisition opportunities from time to time  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms  or at all  or that it will be successful in integrating any such acquisitions into its operations 
the company s industries are characterized by intense competition 
the company s components sold to the aerospace industry are provided by a large fragmented group of companies  including certain business units or affiliates of the company s customers 
however  the company is unaware of any single company in the aerospace industry with which it competes in all of the company s processes 
the company believes that competition within the aerospace industry will increase substantially as a result of industry consolidations and trends toward favoring greater outsourcing of components and reducing the number of preferred suppliers 
the company also believes that foreign aerospace manufacturers will become an increasing source of competition  due largely to foreign manufacturers access to low cost labor and the increased prevalence of industry participation commitments  pursuant to which domestic oems and primes agree to award production work to manufacturers from a foreign country in order to obtain orders from that country 
in contrast to the aerospace industry  the machining and technology division has only a few competitors for the products it produces 
certain of the company s competitors in all of its industries  have substantially greater financial  production and other resources than the company 
these competitors may have i the ability to adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements and industry conditions or trends  ii stronger relationships with customers and suppliers and iii greater name recognition than the company 
there can be no assurance that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operation 
decreases in the availability  or increases in the cost  of the company s raw materials would increase the company s operating costs 
most of the company s components are manufactured from aluminum products 
from time to time the company  and the aerospace components industry as a whole  has experienced shortages in the availability of aerospace quality aluminum 
in addition  the company s machining and technology segment utilizes materials that  in some cases  may be provided by a limited number of suppliers 
raw material shortages could inhibit the company s ability to deliver products to its customers on a timely basis 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to purchase sufficient quantities of aluminum products or other materials to meet its production needs in the future  or that necessary materials will be available on satisfactory terms or at reasonable prices 
any such material shortage or price escalation would increase the company s operating costs  which would likely reduce profits 
the company s long term success and growth strategy depend on its senior management and the company s ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the company has entered into written employment agreements with all of its senior management personnel and maintains key man life insurance policies on the lives of certain of such personnel 
however  the loss of service of one or more of the company s senior management personnel could result in a loss of leadership and an inability to successfully pursue the company s long term success and growth strategy 
the company s success and future growth also depends on management s ability to attract  hire  train  integrate and retain qualified personnel in all areas of its business 
competition for such personnel is intense and the company s inability to adequately staff its operations with such personnel could render the company less efficient  thereby slowing its rate of production 
in addition  rising costs associated with certain employee benefits  and in particular the rising costs associated with providing employee health coverage  could limit the ability of the company to provide certain employee benefits in the future 
the company s inability to provide a competitive employee benefits package could limit the ability of the company to recruit and retain qualified personnel 
compliance with and changes in environmental  health and safety laws and other laws that regulate the operation of the company s business could increase the cost of production and expose the company to regulatory claims 
the company s operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal  state and local laws and substantial regulation by government agencies  including the united states environmental protection agency epa  the united states occupational safety and health administration osha and the federal aviation administration faa 
among other matters  these agencies impose requirements that regulate the operation  handling  transportation and disposal of hazardous materials generated or used by the company during the normal course of its operations  govern the health and safety of the company s employees and require the company to meet certain standards and licensing requirements for aerospace components 
this extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on the company and  as a result  may substantially affect its operational costs 
in addition  the company may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in its facilities without regard to whether or not the company knew of  or caused  the release of such substances 
the company believes that it currently is in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any material environmental violations at any of its current or former facilities 
there can be no assurance  however  that its prior activities did not create a material environmental situation for which the company could be responsible or that future uses or conditions including  without limitation  changes in applicable environmental laws and regulation  or an increase in the amount of hazardous substances generated or used by the company s operations will not result in any material environmental liability to the company or result in a material adverse effect to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the operations of the end users of the product platforms into which the company s components are integrated could expose the company to product liability claims 
although the company assists its customers in the design of a limited number of parts  components and sub assemblies  the company s business may still be exposed to possible claims of personal injury  death or property damage that may result from the failure or malfunction of any component or subassembly fabricated by the company 
the company currently has in place aviation products liability and premises insurance  which the company believes provides coverage in amounts and on terms that are generally consistent with industry practice 
the company has not experienced any product liability claims related to its products 
however  the company may be subject to a material loss  to the extent that a claim is made against the company that is not covered in whole or in part by insurance  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that insurance coverages can be maintained in the future at a cost acceptable to the company 
the company s facilities are located in regions that suffer from natural disasters 
several of the company s facilities are located in regions that have an increased risk of earthquake activity  and one of the company s facilities has experienced damage due to floods in the past 
although the company maintains earthquake and standard blanket flood loss insurance where necessary  an earthquake  flood or other natural disaster could have a material adverse effect on the company s business or its operating results 
the market price of the company s common stock may be volatile 
the market price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results  changes in financial estimates by security analysts or failure of the company to meet such estimates and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced volatility that has affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies 
the resulting changes in such market prices are often unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
accordingly  market volatility could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
certain provisions in the company s charter documents may have the effect of delaying  deterring  or preventing certain potential acquisitions or a change in control of the company 
the company s restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain provisions that reduce the probability of a change of control or acquisition of the company 
these provisions include  but are not limited to i the ability of the board to issue preferred stock in one or more series with such rights  obligations and preferences as the board may determine  without any further vote or action by the shareholders  ii advance notice procedures for shareholders to nominate candidates for election as directors of the company and for shareholders to submit proposals for consideration at shareholders meetings  iii the staggered election of directors  and iv restrictions on the ability of shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders 
in addition  the company is subject to section of the general and business corporation law of missouri  which  under certain circumstances  may prohibit a business combination between the company and a shareholder owning or more of the outstanding voting power of the company 
customers and products 
customers the company s principal customers serviced by the sheet metal segment are boeing  lockheed martin and gulfstream  leading oems and primes in the commercial  corporate and regional and military aircraft markets of the aerospace industry 
during  direct sales to these customers accounted for a total of approximately  of the segment s sales 
according to industry sources  boeing alone holds approximately a share of the worldwide commercial aircraft market 
typically  the company conducts its aerospace business under contracts that provide for i payment on a net day basis  ii termination for convenience upon days notice  iii reasonable manufacturing lead time for delivery of components  iv limitations on and specifications for the scope of work to be performed  and v pricing of components by quotes 
in addition  these contracts are typically requirements contracts under which the purchaser commits to purchase all of its requirements of a particular component from the company 
specific orders are placed with the company on a periodic basis 
the machining and technology segment s principal customer is cymer  a manufacturer of semi conductor equipment in the technology industry 
during  cymer accounted for of the machining and technology segment sales 
products 
the company fabricates  machines  and integrates formed  close tolerance aluminum and specialty alloy components for use by the aerospace  technology  and commercial sheet metal industries 
all components are fabricated from designs and specifications prepared and furnished by its customers 
because the company manufactures thousands of components  no one component accounts for a significant portion of the company s sales 
the following table describes some of the principal products manufactured by each of the company s segments  and the models into which they are integrated product models sheet metal segment wing leading edge skins  flapskins  winglets ng  g iv  and citation x detail interior components boeing classic  ng      and c wing panels and floorbeams door assembly structural details classic  ng  and  challenger  regional jet  f  c  and business jet thrust reversers and engine nacelles cowlings g iv  cl  classic   and b cockpit window frames and landing light lens ng     citation iii  vii and excel  md  assembly kc and f fuselage and wing skin models and  dash   classic  ng      c  f  soverign  citation  g iii  g iv and g v housings and assemblies for gun turret ah apache helicopter structural sheet metal extruded components c and various models auxiliary power units embrair regional jet  v osprey machining and technology segment fans  heat exchangers  and various assemblies and els  els  and xla components various components and assemblies intralase fs laser manufacturing process the manufacturing facilities are organized by work centers focusing on a particular manufacturing process 
depending on the component  the company utilizes either a forming process or a machining process 
each work center is staffed by a team of operators who are supported by a supervisor  lead operators and quality inspectors 
throughout each stage of the manufacturing and finishing processes  the company collects  maintains and evaluates data  including customer design inputs  process scheduling  material inventory  labor  inspection results and completion and delivery dates 
the company s information systems employ this data to provide accurate pricing and scheduling information to its customers as well as to establish production standards used to measure internal performance 
in manufacturing some components for the sheet metal division  the company uses several forming processes to shape or form a work piece aluminum  stainless steel or titanium sheet metal and extrusion into components by applying pressure through impact  stretching or pressing the raw material sheet metal or extrusion to cause conformance to a die 
the shapes may be simple with a single angle  bend or curve  or may be complex with compound contours having multiple bends and angles 
some processes incorporate heat to soften the metal prior to or during forming 
forming processes include drop hammer  fluid cell press  sheet metal and extrusion stretch  skin stretch  stretch draw  hot joggle  brake forming  roll forming and radial draw 
additionally  certain products manufactured by the sheet metal segments and virtually all of the machining and technology segment products are produced using close tolerance machining methods 
various metals are machined such as stainless  aluminum  monel  kevlar  and numerous varieties of steel and castings for small to medium sized parts in heat treated and non heat treated conditions 
parts are processed through conventional and computer numerical control machining methods  also known as cnc  from raw material or castings up to and through assembly processes 
in addition  complex machining of parts is accomplished through experience in engineering set ups to produce intricate and close tolerances  with very restricted finish requirements 
each machining facility is also set up to complete turnkey  research and development projects to better support engineering changes from customers 
value added services in addition to the products the company sells  each segment offers its customers various value added services that are intended to result in both cost and time savings 
these services may include the production of tooling  heat treating and aging of components  computer inspection and engineering of components  chemical milling  metal finishing  polishing and painting  assembly  prototyping and warehousing  distribution and kitting 
backlog the company s backlog for each of its business segments is displayed in the following table as of december  in millions sheet metal segment total portion deliverable within months machining and technology segment total portion deliverable within months the company acquired tempco engineering  which comprises the machining and technology segment  in april of the company s customers often modify purchase orders to accelerate or delay delivery dates 
the level of unfilled orders at any given time during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company s receipt of orders and the speed with which those orders are filled 
moreover  sales during any period may include sales which are not part of the backlog at the end of the prior period 
raw materials and procurement practices most of the company s aerospace components are manufactured from aerospace quality aluminum sheet metal and extrusion 
from time to time the company  and the aerospace components industry as a whole  has experienced shortages in the availability of aerospace quality aluminum sheet metal and extrusion 
such shortages could inhibit the company s ability to deliver products to its customers on a timely basis 
a strategy adopted by the commercial division of boeing  requires that boeing subcontractors purchase aluminum sheet  aluminum extrusion and titanium sheet from tmx aerospace boeing designated raw material service provider 
this supply chain approach is intended to control raw material pricing and assure adequate levels of inventory for both boeing and its supply base 
additional designated material source strategies are used by several of the company s customers 
like the boeing arrangement  these customers provide the company with access to an assured supply of materials at competitive pricing 
the company obtains its raw materials for the technology portion of its machining and technology segment from a variety of vendors and distributors 
the company believes its sources of raw materials and its relationships with its suppliers are satisfactory 
while the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on the company until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced providing products  alternative suppliers exist for substantially all of the products and services purchased by the company 
quality assurance and control the company continually seeks to maintain high quality standards in the fabrication and processing of its products 
accordingly  the company employs full time quality control and assurance personnel 
each work order introduced to the company s manufacturing facilities contains an inspection plan specifying required inspection points 
quality inspectors are assigned to each work center and are trained in the testing required in connection with products passing through the assigned work center 
although a large percentage of the company s products are inspected immediately prior to shipment by a customer employee or a customer designated company employee  boeing has approved a sampling inspection program for certain components using statistical process control data maintained by the company 
in march  the company was certified as compliant with boeing s new d quality assurance standard 
certain facilities have received their iso  nadcap and as third party certifications while others are still involved in the certification process 
during the company will continue to review all procedures to ensure they meet the latest revisions of the iso and as standards as required for compliance 
the company will continue with its ongoing employee training program and use of lean manufacturing techniques to assist employees in becoming familiar with any changes in the company s procedures 
the company has continued to develop a robust internal auditing program for each of the facilities to ensure that the training is effective and to ensure ongoing compliance to customer required standards 
sales and marketing the company has realigned its sales and marketing organization into four market sectors commercial aerospace  military aircraft  business regional jets  and non aerospace which includes sales to the technology and commercial sheet metal industries 
within these sectors one sales and marketing director  two market sector directors  and five program managers support the company and its customers in the conduct of business 
at each of the company s facilities  customer service representatives establish and maintain an associate business relationship between customers and the company s production and fabrication business units  with a focus on customer satisfaction 
additionally  three independent sales representatives conduct business on behalf of the company  two of whom are located in the united states and one in the united kingdom 
a majority of the company s sales to existing customers are awarded after receipt of a request for quotation rfq 
on receipt  the rfq is preliminarily reviewed by a team consisting of members of the company s senior management  a program manager  an estimator and the plant manager 
if the company determines the program is adequately compatible with the company s capabilities and objectives  a formal response is prepared by a member of the company s estimator group 
although a substantial percentage of programs are awarded on a competitive bid basis  the company has recognized a recent trend favoring reverse auctions for simple aerospace components 
competition components for customers in the aerospace industry are provided by a large fragmented group of companies  including certain business units or affiliates of the company s customers 
the company believes participants in the aerospace industry compete primarily with respect to delivery  price and quality 
to the contrary  the company believes that there are only a few producers of components similar to the principal technology components manufactured by the company s machining and technology segment 
the company believes that engineering capability  responsiveness and price are key aspects of competition in the technology industry 
in all industries in which the company competes  certain of the company s competitors  including business units affiliated with the company s customers  have substantially greater financial  production and other resources than the company 
the company has also recognized a trend by certain of its customers to outsource production to foreign countries  where labor costs are significantly lower 
this trend has been exacerbated by the expanded use of industry participation arrangements  pursuant to which oems and primes agree to outsource certain manufacturing contract work to a foreign country in return for orders for new aircraft 
governmental regulations  environmental compliance the company s operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal  state and local laws and substantial regulation by government agencies  including the united states environmental protection agency epa  the united states occupational safety and health administration osha and the federal aviation administration faa 
among other matters  these agencies impose requirements that regulate the handling  transportation and disposal of hazardous materials generated or used by the company during the normal course of its operations  govern the health and safety of the company s employees and require the company to meet certain standards and licensing requirements for aerospace components 
this extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on the company and  as a result  may substantially affect its operational costs 
in addition  the company may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in its facilities without regard to whether or not the company knew of  or caused  the release of such substances 
the company believes it currently is in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any material environmental violations at any of its current or former facilities 
there can be no assurance  however  that its prior activities did not create a material environmental situation for which the company could be responsible for or that future uses or conditions including  without limitation  changes in applicable environmental laws and regulation  or an increase in the amount of hazardous substances generated or used by the company s operations will not result in any material environmental liability to the company or result in a material adverse effect to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
employees as of december   the company had permanent employees  of whom were engaged in executive positions  were engaged in administrative positions and were engaged in manufacturing operations 
none of the company s employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement  and the company has not experienced any material business interruption as a result of labor disputes since it was formed 
the company believes it has an excellent relationship with its employees 
the company strives to continuously train and educate its employees  thereby enhancing the skill and flexibility of its work force 
through the use of internally developed programs  which include formal classroom and on the job  hands on training  independently developed programs  and certain company funded tuition reimbursement programs  the company seeks to attract  develop and retain the personnel necessary to achieve the company s growth and profitability objectives

overview the company manufactures formed and machined components for use in the aerospace  technology and commercial sheet metal industries 
the company primarily sells its product to the commercial aircraft  military  corporate and regional aircraft markets  and technology markets within the aerospace and technology industries 
historically  the company s business was primarily dependent on the commercial aircraft market  with boeing as the company s principal customer 
in order to diversify its product and customer base  the company implemented an acquisition and marketing strategy in the late s that has broadened the number of industries to which the company sells its components  and  within the aerospace industry  has diversified its customer base to reduce the company s dependence on boeing 
the following table illustrates the company s sales over the last three years to its primary industries and markets 
market commercial aircraft corporate and regional aircraft military products technology products other total includes commercial sheet metal and various aerospace products 
beginning in  the company began an aggressive acquisition campaign that resulted in the consummation of four transactions through in april  the company acquired tempco engineering inc tempco and its affiliates  which expanded the company s aerospace product line and introduced the company to the technology industry 
in  the company acquired versaform corporation versaform and its affiliates  as well as stretch forming corporation sfc and southern stretch forming and fabrication  inc ssff 
the versaform acquisition significantly increased the company s presence in the corporate and regional aircraft market  while adding some military products to the company s product line 
the sfc acquisition further supplemented the company s military product line 
finally  the company s acquisition of ssff increased the company s business in the corporate and regional market 
as a result of the development of tempco s business  the company determined that tempco should operate and be managed as an autonomous unit  and accordingly as a business segment separate from the company s other businesses 
the tempco business  which sells machined components to both the aerospace and technology industries  is referred to in this discussion as the machining and technology segment and the company s other businesses are referred to as the sheet metal segment 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table provides the comparative data for and for each of the company s segments 
machining machining sheet metal technology total sheet metal technology total net sales cost of sales gross profit s  g a goodwill impairment income loss from operations the sheet metal segment net sales 
net sales for the sheet metal segment were million in compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase resulted from the company s three acquisitions in  significantly offset by reduced sales to the commercial aircraft market 
the company s acquisition of versaform contributed million in net sales  primarily in the corporate and regional aircraft market 
additionally  the acquisition of ssff contributed million of net sales to the corporate and regional markets in the acquisition of sfc added million to net sales  primarily in the military market 
excluding acquisitions  the sheet metal division experienced a decrease in net sales to million in from million in the following table summarizes the company s sheet metal division s net sales by market  with and without acquisitions with without market acquisitions acquisitions commercial aircraft m m m corporate regional aircraft m m m military m m m other m m m total m m m because substantially all of the segment s net sales are attributable to the aerospace industry markets  the sheet metal segment is heavily influenced by various factors that influence the demand patterns of the company s aerospace customers 
the events of september   influenced the commercial aircraft market significantly and is primarily responsible for the segment decline in sales 
shortly after september   boeing  the company s dominant customer in the commercial aircraft market  scaled back its production rates on all of its models 
as a result  sales of products used on boeing aircraft dropped to million  excluding acquisitions  in from million in net sales on the aircraft were million in  down from million in resulting from production rate declines and inventory management by boeing and its subcontractors 
additionally  net sales on the aircraft declined by to million in from million in for similar reasons 
the sheet metal segment experienced similar percentage declines on boeing s  and aircraft 
versaform added million in sales to the commercial aircraft market 
the company s net sales for corporate and regional aircraft  excluding acquisitions  increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to new orders from gulfstream  resulting from the closing of a gulfstream facility 
excluding acquisitions  net sales for products used on gulfstream aircraft were million in  an increase of from million in the increase in gulfstream sales was partially offset by a decline in net sales to learjet due to production rate cutbacks 
net sales to learjet were million in  down from million in versaform contributed net sales to the corporate and regional aircraft market of million 
net sales for products used on gulfstream aircraft were million from versaform and million from ssff 
additionally  versaform s net sales to cessna were million 
excluding acquisitions  net sales on military programs were up to million in from million in this increase is attributable to sales to lockheed martin for new work on the c aircraft and a combination of production rate increases and new work on the f versaform s net sales on military programs were million  predominantly derived from a program to refurbish nacelles on b bombers 
gross profit 
the sheet metal segment experienced a gross profit of million of net sales in compared to million of net sales in versaform added million of the net sales of versaform to gross profit 
excluding versaform  the sheet metal segment generated a gross profit of million of the net sales of the sheet metal segment excluding versaform 
the decline in gross profit was caused by cost over runs on certain new programs during the company encountered significant difficulties with a new package of components from a military customer 
additional production difficulties were encountered on military components obtained in the company s acquisition of sfc in june the utilization of furnished tooling on both programs created high levels of scrap and large amounts of inefficient labor  which  along with inadequate pricing  resulted in accrued losses in the production of these components and a million write down of components not yet completed at year end 
the company has presented this customer with a claim for certain of these costs incurred and has requested re pricing of several of the components to provide an adequate return on future deliveries 
however  because management believes that the collection of this claim is not yet probable  no benefit of this claim has been recorded in if the company cannot come to an agreement with this customer that is reasonably acceptable to the company  the company will take other measures to avoid future losses including the return of the work statement to its customer 
additionally  the sheet metal segment experienced production difficulties with a new corporate and regional aircraft program it received in the difficulties resulted primarily from excessive amounts of scrap and problems with a subcontractor critical to the production of these components 
these difficulties resulted in losses on completed product and accrued losses of million on components in process at year end 
subsequent to year end the company notified the customer of its intention to no longer manufacture these components 
the company may agree to provide certain forming services for these components at prices acceptable to the company 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the sheet metal segment incurred selling  general  and administrative expenses sga of million in  an increase from million in the acquisition of versaform and ssff added million in sga  primarily related to salaries  wages and professional fees to support the integration of the acquired business 
excluding the acquisitions  increased professional fees of million in offset the benefit of not amortizing goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no

the segment recorded an impairment charge of million to reflect the write off of goodwill as determined under sfas no 
see note of the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report on form k and critical accounting estimates set forth later in this discussion for more information on the testing process and assumptions made by the company interest expense 
the sheet metal segment incurred interest expenses of million in  up from million in  due to the million in debt incurred to finance the acquisition of versaform and additional borrowing under the company s revolving line of credit made in order to fund working capital needs 
the machining and technology segment net sales 
the machining and technology segment had net sales of million in  up from million in a portion of this increase was attributable to the fact that sales only included nine months of activity after the acquisition of tempco in april the rest of the segment s growth resulted from an increase in sales to both the technology and aerospace industries 
net sales to the technology industry were million  of which million was for product used in excimer laser applications of net sales in compared to million of net sales in this increase was attributable to increased production demand and new product development orders from its technology customers 
net sales to the aerospace industry were million 
products used in the military market increased to million of net sales for from million of net sales 
these sales primarily related to components used on the apache helicopter for boeing and its prime subcontractors and guidance systems for various military applications for northrop 
net sales for these programs were stronger in the first half of as the united states military was involved in the conflict in afghanistan  but moderated in the second half of the year 
gross profit 
gross profit for the machining and technology segment was million of net sales in  an increase from million of net sales in the additional volume and mix of work afforded better coverage of fixed costs for the segment 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in this increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of only nine months of expenses in and additional payroll of approximately million for new management positions created in as required by sfas no 
 the company conducted an annual impairment test of goodwill and ceased amortizing goodwill  a benefit of million in see note to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report on form k 
interest expense 
in order to finance the purchase of tempco  the company secured term debt in the amount of million bearing a variable rate of interest with a floor of and a cap of 
interest expense resulting from this indebtedness was million in compared to million in only nine months of expense were recorded in interest expense from to reduced slightly as interest rates have declined on this variable rate debt 
non operating expenses other expense 
included in other  net is a charge of million to write down the value of available for sale securities 
these securities have exposure to the aerospace industry 
the value of these securities declined as the overall market declined after the events of september  and did not improve as difficult conditions continued to plague the commercial aerospace industry 
therefore  the company determined the decline in value to be other than temporary and recorded an adjustment to write off the carrying value of these securities 
income taxes 
the income tax benefit in was million compared to an expense of million in due to operating losses 
during  the company s effective tax rate was compared to in the decrease in effective tax rate is predominantly attributable to the impairment of non deductible goodwill recorded in see note to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report on form k for further information on the company s effective tax rate 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 under which goodwill will no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment 
the company completed the required transitional impairment test and recorded a  charge  net of tax for the impairment of the sheet metal segments goodwill as of january  see note to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report on form k for further information 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the sheet metal segment net sales 
net sales for were million  an increase of from the million in in the commercial aircraft market  the segment generated increases in net sales on all boeing models that the segment supports 
net sales for the aircraft were million of net sales in  up from million of net sales in net sales for the aircraft were million of net sales in  up from million of net sales in this growth in net sales was due to production rate increases at boeing 
net sales to the corporate and regional aircraft market were million of net sales in  down from million of net sales in the company s sales to this market reflected declines with gulfstream and bombardier s canadair and learjet divisions 
the company experienced declines in this market in the fourth quarter of as companies delayed shipments in the aftermath of the events of september  net sales to the military market were million of net sales  up from million of net sales in new part awards and increased production rates on existing components on the f resulted in sales of million of net sales in  an increase from million of net sales in gross profit 
the division s gross profit was million of net sales  up from million of net sales 
the segment increased gross profit by improving efficiencies 
the segment increased net sales by million while manufacturing labor and fringe costs remained flat at million in both and additionally  the increased revenue provided better coverage of fixed costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses of million in  unchanged from  decreased as a percent of sales due to higher sales volume 
the machining and technology segment net sales 
the segment did not exist prior to the acquisition of tempco in april and therefore did not have operating results in net sales were million for the nine months of subsequent to the acquisition 
net sales of technology components and assemblies for use in excimer laser applications were million of net sales 
the segment had net sales of million to the military market of the aerospace industry  principally for use in boeing s ah apache attack helicopter and various guidance products for northrop 
gross profit 
gross profit generated by this segment was million of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the segment had selling  general and administrative expenses of million in significant expenses in this category are goodwill amortization of million  labor of million and professional services of million 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in from a term loan used to finance the purchase of tempco engineering 
non operating expenses other  net 
other expense was million during  as compared to other income of million in this change of  resulted primarily from a million charge related to the company s assessment that certain investments treated as available for sale securities had declined in value on a basis that was other than temporary 
the value of these securities decreased as the stock markets declined after the attacks of september  the value of these securities did not recover in the fourth quarter and were therefore written down to market value 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate increased in to from in due to a tax reserve of million which offset the deferred tax benefit generated by the write down of the investment in available for sale securities 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operations used million of cash in the company experienced a loss of million  which included non cash goodwill impairment charges of million  depreciation and amortization expenses of million and unrealized losses on available for sale securities of million 
excluding acquisitions  accounts receivable and inventories increased by a total of million 
the state of the aerospace industry and the overall slowing of the economy has caused several of the company s customers to slow their payments and purchasing patterns 
in addition  inventory increased due to new programs begun in the second half of in april  the company settled a purchase price adjustment related to the purchase of tempco engineering with the payment of million in cash 
in may  the company purchased versaform and its affiliates for cash of million and the issuance of a note payable of million to the seller 
the million was funded by a three year term note with the company s primary lender amortized over seven years 
the company funded the acquisition of sfc of million in june by drawing down on its revolving line of credit 
the company purchased ssff in september for million in cash and  shares of the company s common stock 
the company purchased million of property  plant and equipment during these purchases were primarily for computerized milling equipment and the creation of a web portal for communicating with the company s customers and suppliers 
the net losses experienced by the company in the third and fourth quarters of primarily as a result of product issues associated with new work in the st 
charles plant  caused the company to violate certain restrictive financial covenants in its bank credit agreement with its primary lender 
additionally  subsequent to year end  the company exhausted its available borrowings under its revolving credit facility of million  peaking at million 
the company provided forecasts of operations and cash flows to the bank and  in april  negotiated revised covenants  secured an increase in its revolving credit facility to million  subject to a borrowing base calculation  and extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to january  as a part of the negotiations  the bank also required an increase in the interest rate on the revolving credit facility of  restrictions on capital expenditures  and a fee of  additionally  the bank required the company to retain a financial consultant to work with management to analyze operations and cash management 
independently  the company has undertaken a plan to reduce operating expenses at all facilities with primary emphasis on the st 
charles facility 
these immediate cost savings include reductions in overtime worked and controllable expenses 
as required by its amended credit facility  management  in conjunction with the financial consultant  will submit to the bank by june   a plan for improving operating performance 
this plan may include  but is not limited to  headcount reductions  downsizing or closing of facilities  and elimination of or reduction in specific customers or production processes 
based on forecasted operating results and cash flows  management believes that cash flow from operations and the expanded capacity under the revolving credit agreement  as described in note of the financial statements  will be adequate to fund the company s operations in the forecasted operating results and cash flows are dependent on management s ability to improve performance in the st 
charles plant and accomplish certain expected reductions in operating expenses 
while management believes this forecast is achievable  to the extent that management does not improve operating performance and reduce expenses  the company may have to seek alternative sources of financing 
there can be no assurances that the company can obtain alternative financing on reasonable and acceptable terms 
critical accounting policies certain accounting issues require management estimates and judgements for the preparation of financial statements 
the company believes that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on the company s financial statements 
therefore  the company considers these to be its critical accounting estimates 
the company s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to these estimates in the management discussion and analysis 
the company s most significant estimates and judgements are listed below 
accounts receivable reserve 
the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors  including historical trends and industry and general economic conditions 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial downgrading of credit scores  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
the company s evaluation also includes reserves for billing adjustments  pricing changes  warranty claims and disputes 
if circumstances change ie  an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to the company  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due the company could be reduced by a material amount 
the company applies this policy to its acquired businesses and makes adjustments to existing bad debt reserves based upon its evaluation 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to a limited number of customers in the aerospace and technology industries 
if these customers experience significant adverse conditions in their industries or operations  including the continued impact of the current downturn in demand for aerospace and technology products  these customers may not be able to meet their ongoing financial obligations to the company for prior sales or purchase additional products under the terms of existing contracts 
inventory 
the company values its inventories at the lower of cost or market using actual cost for raw materials and average cost for finished goods and work in process 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  the company makes judgments as to future demand requirements based upon customer orders in backlog  historical customer orders  customer and industry analyst estimates of aircraft production rates  and other market data available to the company 
additionally  in the aviation industry  these future demand requirements depend on estimates of aircraft lives and the need for spare parts over the course of the aircraft life 
the company has recorded charges in recent periods due to discontinuances of product lines  losses of customer contracts  lack of order activity  or changes in expectations of future requirements 
the company sells much of its product under fixed price arrangements 
occasionally  costs of production may exceed the market values of certain products and product families which require the company to adjust its inventory value 
in these circumstances  management is required to make estimates of costs not yet incurred to determine the ultimate cost of these products which are in work in process 
changes in the assumptions and estimates of such factors as expected scrap  costs of material  labor  and outside services  and the amount of labor required to complete the products may result in actual results that vary from management s estimates 
at times  the company accepts new orders for products from its customers in which actual production costs may differ from the company s expectations when it quoted the product 
additionally  customers may request engineering changes or quality acceptance changes in products that may alter the cost of products produced by the company 
in these circumstances  the company notifies the customer of these issues and seeks reimbursement for costs incurred over and above the selling price of the products and re pricing of the product on future deliveries 
the company s inventory valuation considers the estimated recovery of these costs 
actual negotiation of the claim amounts may result in outcomes different from those estimated by the company and may have material impacts upon the operating results of the company 
during the fourth quarter of  significant cost over runs were incurred on certain products for which the company submitted a claim to its customer 
at year end  the company could not estimate the probable recovery of any amounts covered by this claim 
therefore  excess inventory costs were written off and margins in were negatively impacted 
subsequent recovery of this claim could have a material impact upon future operating results of the company goodwill 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
which addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and was adopted by the company effective january  the statement requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment and expensed to the extent the fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  is less than its carrying amount 
the company determined its operating segments to be its reporting units under sfas no 
the application of the transitional impairment test resulted in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million million net of tax and the annual impairment test resulted in an impairment charge of million for the sheet metal segment  as described in note of the financial statements 
the company established the fair value of its reporting units with the assistance of an outside expert that used company provided forecasts of operations by reporting unit  independent review of the assumptions in these forecasts  evaluations of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and independent appraisals of the company s fixed assets 
these forecasts required the company to estimate future sales prices and volumes of its reporting units 
the company used its internal budgets  customer order backlog  historical customer ordering patterns  customer and industry projections of demand and other market information as well as current cost of production to estimate future cash flows 
actual results may vary significantly from the company s projections and may result in material adjustments to the goodwill balance on the company s financial statements 
self insured reserves 
the company provides health insurance for many of its employees through an insurance arrangement that requires the company to fund all claims incurred up to certain limits 
the company purchases an insurance policy to limit the amount of claims that it will be responsible to fund on any specific claim as well as a policy that limits the total claims that the company would be responsible to fund in a specific plan year 
since time delays occur between delivery of medical services and ultimate payment of these services  the company is required to estimate the incurred claims that have not yet been settled by the administrator that adjusts these claims 
the administrator of the claims provides the company information such as historical claim values  trends in medical costs  and time lags between service dates and ultimate payment dates 
the company uses this information to estimate the amount of claims that may have been incurred but are not yet reported in order to establish a liability on its financial statements 
additionally  the company provides workers compensation insurance for certain of its employees that requires the company to pay for actual losses plus an administrative fee for all claims and expenses incurred 
the company has negotiated minimum and maximum amounts that it may be required to fund with its insurance carrier 
the company is provided such information as claim losses  estimated amounts that the insurance company feels will be required to settle the claim  and estimates of time delay between injuries and notification of injuries 
the company uses this information to estimate its liability under this arrangement 
actual claim experience under these insurance plans may vary from estimates made by the company and could have material impacts upon its financial statements
