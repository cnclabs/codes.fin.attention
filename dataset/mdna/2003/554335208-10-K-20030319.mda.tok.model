asset impairment charges in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of for possible impairment when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
during the year ended december   we wrote down assets determined to be imparied by approximately million 
the asset write down related to one of our full service car wash sites in texas and two full service car wash sites in arizona 
we have determined that due to poor demographics and increased competition in the geographic areas of these sites  their future expected cash flows will not be sufficient to recover their respective carrying values 
we are marketing these sites for sale and have written down these assets to their estimated fair market values based on expected proceeds upon sale 
in  we wrote down the value of our berlin  new jersey facility by  to reflect the sales price of those assets in january interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  for the year ended december   was million compared to million for this decrease in our interest expense is the result of a decrease in interest rates on approximately of our long term debt which has interest rates tied to the prime rate and a reduction in our outstanding debt as a result of normal principal payments 
interest expense  net of interest income  for the year ended december   was million compared to million for the year ended december  this is the result of additional interest expense on borrowings relating to several acquisitions in the year ended december   and additional working capital borrowings through a refinancing in the last quarter of this increase was offset by a decrease in interest rates on approximately of our long term debt which has interest rates tied to the prime rate 
other income other income for was  compared to  for the primary reason for the decrease is that the figure includes a  gain on the sale of a car wash facility in august of other income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  this increase was primarily due to a pre tax gain of approximately  on the sale of our facility in morrisville  pennsylvania in  offset partially by a reduction in certain rental income in income taxes we recorded income tax benefit expense from continuing operations of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively

at december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
components of the net operating loss carryforwards include million from continuing operations and million from acquired net operating losses attributable to the colonial full service car wash  inc acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity cash and cash equivalents were million at december  the ratio of our total debt to total capitalization  which consists of total debt plus stockholders equity  was at december   at december   and at december  our business requires a substantial amount of capital  most notably to pursue our expansion strategies  including our current expansion in the electronic surveillance products business  and for equipment purchases and upgrades for our car care segment 
we plan to meet these capital needs from various financing sources  including borrowings  internally generated funds  and the issuance of common stock if the market price of the company s stock improves 
as of december   we had negative working capital of approximately million 
at december   working capital was million and cash and cash equivalents were million 
the change in working capital at december  is primarily attributable to the reclassification of approximately million of year amortizing loans from long term to current liabilities as a result of these loans being due in july and november the company intends to renew these loans with the current lender 
although the company has been successful in renewing similar loans with the current lender in the past  including the renewal of two loans in february totaling million for a five year period  there can be no assurance that our lender will continue to provide us with renewals or with renewals at favorable terms 
we estimate aggregate capital expenditures for our car care segment  exclusive of acquisitions of businesses  of approximately  for the year ending december  in october  we purchased a building as a warehouse  production and administrative facility for our new electronic surveillance products operations 
we financed a portion of the  purchase price of this building with a long term mortgage of approximately  in addition to the purchase of the electronic surveillance products business and facility  we will also expend significant cash for the purchasing of inventory as we introduce new electronic surveillance products and for improvements to the new building 
we estimate we will spend approximately million for our initial inventory of electronic surveillance products through the first quarter ending march  and approximately  for capital improvements to the recently purchased building through the second quarter ending june  debt capitalization and other financing arrangements at december   we had borrowings of approximately million 
we had three letters of credit outstanding at december   totaling  as collateral relating to workers compensation insurance policies 
additionally  we had four commercial letters of credit outstanding at december  totaling  for the purchase of inventory for our new electronic surveillance products business

during and  we refinanced on a long term basis under favorable terms the majority of our short term debt related to our and acquisitions 
we also had various other long term mortgage notes up for periodic review during which we have been successful in renewing 
several of our debt agreements  as amended  contain certain affirmative and negative covenants and require the maintenance of certain levels of tangible net worth and the maintenance of certain debt coverage ratios on an individual subsidiary and consolidated level 
at december   we were not in compliance with our consolidated debt coverage ratios related to our bank one  texas  na bank one term notes  our gmac notes payable and our wachovia bank na wachovia note payable 
at december   we were also not in compliance with a debt coverage ratio requirement related to certain bank one notes payable with our subsidiary  colonial full service car wash  inc colonial 
with respect to the gmac notes payable and the bank one notes payable related to colonial  the company has received waivers of acceleration of the notes as of december  and through january  additionally  the company has entered into amendments to the bank one term loan agreements and a modification agreement to the wachovia note payable 
the company is currently in compliance with the covenants as amended 
the amended debt coverage ratio with bank one requires the company to maintain a consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to debt service the debt coverage ratio of to at december   and at december  and thereafter  and a to ratio for the twelve month periods ending march   june  and september  as of march   the preliminary operating results for the quarter ended march  through this date indicate that we should meet the required debt coverage ratio as of march   however  we cannot provide assurance that favorable operating trends will continue through march  if we default on the bank one covenants  the company will need to obtain a further amendment or waiver from bank one 
if the company is unable to obtain a waiver or amendment  bank one debt totaling  currently recorded as long term debt at december  would become due on demand 
the company s ongoing ability to comply with its debt covenants under its credit arrangements and refinance its debt depends largely on the achievement of adequate levels of cash flow 
our cash flow has been and can continue to be adversely affected by weather patterns and the economic climate 
in the event that non compliance with the debt covenants should reoccur  the company would pursue various alternatives to successfully resolve the non compliance  which might include  among other things  seeking additional debt covenant waivers or amendments  or refinancing of debt with other financial institutions 
although the company believes that it will be successful in resolving potential non compliance with its debt covenants  or refinancing its current debt  there can be no assurance that further debt covenant waivers or amendments will be attained or that the debt will be refinanced with other financial institutions at favorable terms 
the company is obligated under various operating leases  primarily for certain equipment and real estate within the car care segment 
certain of these leases contain purchase options  renewal provisions  and contingent rentals for proportionate share of taxes  utilities  insurance  and annual cost of living increases 
future minimum lease payments under operating leases with initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year as of december  are as follows million  million  million    and thereafter million 
the following are summaries of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt  including capital leases      minimum operating lease payments      amounts expiring per period other commercial commitments total thereafter line of credit standby letters of credit   there were no borrowings outstanding under the company s line of credit at december  on april   we executed a master facility agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion pursuant to which fusion agreed to enter into up to two equity purchase agreements  each with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the master facility agreement expired on february  the first equity purchase agreement was executed by fusion on april  proceeds from purchased shares through december  totaled approximately million 
there were no purchased shares in cash flows operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities in was impacted by a mild winter and a spring with low pollen in our northeast operating region  and unusually high precipitation throughout the majority of the year  especially in our texas and east operating regions 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  the use of cash in reflects  for capital expenditures relating to ongoing car care operations   for ongoing security products operations and  expended for the acquisition of our new electronic surveillance products business in august financing activities 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  this reflects routine principal payments on debt of million and  for the purchase and retirement of shares of our common stock 
seasonality and inflation the company believes that its car washing and detailing operations are adversely affected by extended periods of inclement weather 
in particular  long periods of rain and cloudy weather adversely affect our car wash volumes and related lube and other automotive services as people typically do not wash their cars during such periods 
additionally  extended periods of warm  dry weather may encourage customers to wash their cars themselves which also can adversely affect our car wash business 
the company has mitigated the risk of unfavorable weather patterns by having operations in diverse regions 
the company believes that inflation and changing prices have not had  and are not expected to have any material adverse effect on its results of operations in the near future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are not materially exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or equity prices 
interest rate exposure a significant portion of our debt is at fixed rates  and as such  changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results unless and until such debt would need to be refinanced at maturity 
all of our variable rate debt obligations are tied to the prime rate  as is our incremental borrowing rate 
therefore  a one percent increase in the prime rate would not have a material effect on the fair value of our variable rate debt at december
