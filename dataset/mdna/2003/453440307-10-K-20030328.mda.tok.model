information pertaining to the company s business segments is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and to general practices within the insurance industry 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis 
insurance reserves the company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  including legal and other fees as well as a portion of the company s general expenses  for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
the company computes future insurance policy benefits primarily using the net premium method based on anticipated investment yield  mortality morbidity on health insurance and withdrawals 
liabilities for future insurance policy benefits on certain short term medical coverages were computed using completion factors and expected loss ratios derived from actual historical premium and claim data 
these methods are widely used in the life and health insurance industry to estimate the liabilities for future insurance policy benefits 
inherent in these calculations are management and actuarial judgments and estimates within industry standards which could significantly impact the ending reserve liabilities and  consequently  operating income 
actual results may differ  and these estimates are subject to interpretation and change 
management believes that the company s method of estimating the liabilities for future insurance policy benefits provides a reasonably accurate level of reserves at december   however  if the company s reserves are insufficient to cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses  the company would have to augment its reserves and incur a charge to its earnings  and these charges could be material

the factors considered by management in determining when a decline is other than temporary include bu t are not limited to the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in ratings announced by one or more rating agencies  whether the issuer of a debt security has remained current on principal and interest payments  whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or  alternatively  a reflection of general market or industry conditions  and the company s intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value

independencecare s expenses increased million due to the increase in premium volume and the acquisition of two subsidiary mgus 
corporate pre tax income for the year ended december  decreased by million  resulting from a loss of million in compared to a loss of million in this decrease in income is due to a decrease of million in investment income due to lower returns on certain equity investments and an increase of 
million in general and administrative expenses due to salary related expenses  partially offset by a 
million increase in other income and a 
million decrease in interest expense due to lower interest rates and debt repayments in liquidity insurance group the insurance group normally provides cash flow from i operations  ii the receipt of scheduled principal payments on its portfolio of fixed income securities  and iii earnings on investments 
such cash flow is used partially to finance liabilities for insurance policy benefits 
these liabilities represent long term and short term obligations which are calculated using certain assumed interest rates 
asset quality the nature and quality of insurance company investments must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations which have been promulgated primarily for the protection of policyholders 
of the aggregate carrying value of the insurance group s investment assets  approximately was invested in investment grade fixed income securities  resale agreements  policy loans and cash and cash equivalents at december  also at such date  approximately of the company s fixed maturities were investment grade 
these investments carry less default risk and  therefore  lower interest rates than other types of fixed maturity investments 
at december  approximately of the carrying value of fixed maturities was invested in diversified non investment grade fixed income securities investments in such securities have different risks than investment grade securities  including greater risk of loss upon default  and thinner trading markets 
the company had a negligible amo unt of mortgage loans 
the company does not have any non performing fixed maturities 
investment impairments the company reviews its investments quarterly and monitors its investments continually for impairments 
for the years ended december  and  the company recorded a realized loss for other than temporary impairments of million and million  respectively 
in  million of the loss relates to an interest related impairment recognized on certain interest only securities io securities resulting from expected prepayments of the mortgage obligations underlying the io securities due to falling interest rates 
the company has invested in io securities to help actively manage its interest rate exposure 
typically these securities account for less than of ihc s total portfolio assets and are rated aaa or better 
in a rising interest rate environment  io securities will increase in value which acts to mitigate the loss on the balance of the bond portfolio 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  io securities will lose value  but there will be gains in the rest of the bond portfolio 
although these securities performed as expected  the company applies the methodology of emerging issues task force  recognition of interest income and impairment of purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets eitf in determining when an io security is considered other than temporarily impaired 
the company recorded a realized loss in under eitf  since there had been a decrease in expected cash flows combined with a decline in the io securities fair value below cost 
the company s gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities totaled million at december  substantially all of these securities were investment grade 
the remaining unrealized losses  primarily within the corporate securities portfolio  have been evaluated in accordance with the company s policy and were determined to be temporary in nature at december the company holds all securities as available for sale and accordingly marks all of its securities to market through accumulated other comprehensive income 
therefore  any realized loss generated by impairment losses will have no economic impact on the company s total stockholders equity 
moreover  since every security is marked to market through stockholders equity  the company is never in a position where a decline in the market value of a security would have an unexpected economic impact on the net worth of the company 
risk management the company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a portfolio with a duration and average life that falls within the band of the duration and average life of the applicable liabilities 
options may be utilized to modify the duration and average life of such assets  see note f iv of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following summarizes the estimated pre tax change in fair value based upon hypothetical parallel shifts in the us treasury yield curve of the fixed income portfolio assuming immediate changes in interest rates at specified levels at december  estimated estimated change change in interest rates fair value in fair value in millions basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise base scenario basis point decline basis point decline basis point decline the company monitors its investment portfolio on a continuous basis and believes that the liquidity of the insurance group will not be adversely affected by its current investments 
this monitoring includes the maintenance of an asset liability model that matches current insurance liability cash flows with current investment cash flows 
this is accomplished by first creating an insurance model of the company s in force policies using current assumptions on mortality  lapses and expenses 
then  current investments are assigned to specific insurance blocks in the model using appropriate prepayment schedules and future reinvestment patterns 
the results of the model specify whether the investments and their related cash flows can support the related current insurance cash flows 
additionally  various scenarios are developed changing interest rates and other related assumptions 
these scenarios help evaluate the market risk due to changing interest rates i n relation to the business of the insurance group 
in the company s analysis of the asset liability model  a to basis point change in interest rates on the insurance group s liabilities would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company 
with respect to its liabilities  if interest rates were to increase  the risk to the company is that policies would be surrendered and assets would need to be sold 
this is not a material exposure to the company since a large portion of the insurance group s interest sensitive policies are burial policies that are not subject to the typical surrender patterns of other interest sensitive policies  and many of the insurance group s universal life and annuity policies come from liquidated companies which tend to exhibit lower surrender rates than such policies of continuing companies 
additionally  there are charges to help offset the benefits being surrendered 
if interest rates were to decrease substantially  the risk to the company is that some of its investment assets would be subject to early redemption 
this is not a material exposure because the company would have additional gains in its portfolio to help offset the future reduction of investment income 
with respect to its investments  the company employs from time to time as warranted investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures 
balance sheet total investments increased million to million at december  largely due to an increase in fixed maturities 
an increase in securities purchased under agreements to resell was offset by a decrease in equity securities 
the million increase in future insurance policy benefits reflects growth in the business 
the million increase in total stockholders equity is due to net income generated in the year ended december   and an increase in unrealized gains on the fixed maturity investments partially offset by the net purchase of the company s common stock 
the company had net receivables from reinsurers of million at december  substantially all of the business ceded to such reinsurers is of short duration 
all of such receivables are either due from highly rated companies or are adequately secured 
no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary at december  corporate corporate derives its funds principally from i dividends and interest income from the insurance group  ii management fees from its subsidiaries  and iii investment income from corporate liquidity 
regulatory constraints historically have not affected the company s consolidated liquidity  although state insurance laws have provisions relating to the ability of the parent company to use cash generated by the insurance group 
total corporate liquidity cash  cash equivalents  resale agreements  fixed maturities  equity securities and partnership interests amounted to million at december  during  ihc repurchased  shares of common stock for million under a repurchase program initiated in  and announced that it would purchase up to  additional shares of its common stock under its repurchase program 
on september  ihc completed a modified dutch auction tender offer by repurchasing  shares of its common stock at a purchase price of per share 
during  including those shares from the modified dutch auction  ihc repurchased  shares of common stock for million under its repurchase program 
in the second quarter of  ihc received million upon exercise of  warrants for  shares of common stock 
all unexercised warrants have now expired in accordance with their terms 
capital resources due to its strong capital ratios  broad licensing and excellent asset quality and credit worthiness  the insurance group remains well positioned to increase or diversify its current activities 
it is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity 
in the event additional funds are required  it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable 
in march  the company borrowed million in a pooled trust preferred issuance 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item the company has expected contractual obligations relating to debt repayments and non cancelable leases of the following at december   and  thereafter 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company may carry its portfolio of fixed income securities either as held to maturity carried at amortized cost  as trading securities carried at fair market value or as available for sale carried at fair market value 
the company has chosen to carry all of its debt securities as available for sale 
the company experienced a change in unrealized gains of million  net of deferred taxes of million and net of deferred policy acquisition costs of million in total stockholders equity  reflecting net unrealized gains of million at december  versus 
million at december  from time to time  as warranted  the company employs investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures 
outlook the company anticipates continued favorable operating performance in as a result of i expansion of the distribution of its medical stop loss business through greater production by current mgus  appointment of additional mgus  and acquisition of new mgus  ii increased retention of its employer medical stop loss business  iii its expected increased equity interest in amic  as a result of its tender offer for amic shares  and amic s anticipated increase in income  and iv increased premium and improved loss ratios from madison life s group ltd  group term life and government employees lines and acquisition of blocks of business 
as of march  standard life and madison life expect to have in force approximately million of medical stop loss business through mgus 
the company and its affiliates own or have significant equity investments in mgus that  as of march  expect to have an in force block of over million of medical stop loss 
the company expects to significantly increase its production of employer medical stop loss in as a result of a full year of production from the mgus appointed in  increased production for the insurance group from the mgus that it owns or in which it has equity investments  mgu appointments  and acquisitions of new mgus 
the company has increased its average retention from in to in the company made the decision to increase its retention largely because of its greater control over the mgus that are producing and administering the business 
in addition to controlling the mgus which are owned by the company and its affiliates or in which they have significant equity interests  the company exerts great influence over its other mgus through its high retention of risk and by working with only a selected group of reinsurers that share ihc s commitment to underwriting excellence 
for all of its mgus  standard life and madison life regularly audit the mgus compliance with the company s underwriting  claims and policy issuance guidelines 
the company owns of the common stock of amic  and has tendered for approximately more of amic s outstanding shares 
amic is an insurance holding company that is currently engaged in the medical stop loss business through independence american and the amic mgus 
ihc anticipates that amic will earn meaningful income in madison life anticipates some growth in its group ltd and term life as a result of increased production and improved loss ratios 
premiums from madison life s military government personnel line increased in  as a result of significant expansion of the distribution network for this product  which was introduced in the company expects greater production from this line of the business as a result of expansion of distribution sources 
the company believes that there will be an increase in blocks of business available for acquisition in as a result of underwriting  investment and capital losses suffered by the insurance industry in recent years 
the company will continue to review actively acquisitions  and believes that it is well positioned to consummate additional acquisitions should the opportunity arise 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses costs associated with an exit activity including restructuring or with disposal of long lived assets 
those activities can include eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts  and relocating plan facilities and personnel 
the provisions of sfas will not supersede the accounting requirements for costs to restructure operations acquired in a business combination 
under sfas  companies are required to record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
the new requirements are effective prospectively for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas effective as of january  to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas amends sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change from the intrinsic value method to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
at december   the company continued to apply the intrinsic value method 
sfas also requires more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method used and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the required disclosures applicable to the company are included in note r to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
this interpretation requires that certain disclosures be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under guarantees  effective for financial statements for periods ending after december  fin also requires the recognition  at fair value  of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirement did not have  and the recognition requirement is not expected to have  a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation provides guidance on the identification of entities controlled through means other than voting rights 
fin specifies how a business enterprise should evaluate its interests in a variable interest entity to determine whether to consolidate that entity 
a variable interest entity must be consolidated by its primary beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
a public company with a variable interest in an entity created before february  must apply fin in the first interim or annual period beginning after june  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
safe harbor statement from time to time  information provided by the company  including but not limited to statements in this report  or other statements made by or on behalf of the company  may contain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the company s control  which may cause actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated 
set forth below are important factors that could cause the company s results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the company s results may fluctuate as a result of factors generally affecting the insurance and reinsurance industry the results of companies in the insurance and reinsurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
factors that affect the industry in general could also cause the company s results to fluctuate 
the industry s and the company s financial condition and results of operations may be affected significantly by fluctuations in interest rates  inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment  which affect returns on invested capital and may impact the ultimate payout of loss amounts  rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products  losses related to terrorist activities  random acts of violence or declared or undeclared war  changes in reserves resulting from different types of claims that may arise and the development of judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liability  and the overall level of economic activity and the competitive environment in the industry 
if the rating agencies downgrade the company s insurance companies  the company s results of operations and competitive position in the industry may suffer ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
standard life is rated a excellent and madison life is rated a excellent by am best company  inc  best 
best s ratings reflect its opinions of an insurance company s financial strength  operating performance  strategic position  and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed to investors 
the ratings of standard life and madison life are subject to periodic review by best 
if best reduces either or both madison life s or standard life s ratings from its current levels  the company s business could be adversely affected 
the company s loss reserves are based on an estimate of its future liability  and if actual claims prove to be greater than the company s reserves  its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected the company maintains loss reserves to cover the its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  including legal and other fees as well as a portion of the company s general expenses  for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
because setting reserves is inherently uncertain  the company cannot be sure that current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 
if the company s reserves are insufficient to cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses  the company would have to augment its reserves and incur a change to its earnings  and these charges could be material 
reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability 
rather  reserves represent an estimate of what the company expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost 
these estimates  which generally involve actuarial projections  are based on the company s assessment of facts and circumstances then known  as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity  frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors 
these variables are affected by both internal and external events  such as changes in claims handling procedures  inflation  judicial trends and legislative changes 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable in advance 
additionally  there may be a significant reporting lag between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is reported to the company 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities  particularly those in which the various considerations affecting the type of claim are subject to change and in which long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made 
reserve estimates are continually refined in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled 
adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates ar e changed 
certain proposed federal and state legislation may  if adopted  adversely affect the company s employer medical stop loss business individuals who obtain health coverage through self insured plans cannot currently sue their employer in state court for punitive or compensatory damages  but can seek legal recourse in federal court where an employer can be ordered to cover a wrongfully denied benefit 
in the continuing debate over health care reform  certain federal and state legislation has been proposed which could have the effect of making plan sponsors  administrators  or certain other parties liable for punitive damages in state court 
while the company cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted or what  if any  impact enactment of any of these would have on its employer medical stop loss business  the number of employers offering health benefits or choosing self insured plans could be reduced  plans could increase the portion paid by employees thereby reducing participation  pricing and coverage options could be affected  and the insurance group could be faced with greater liability exposures 
the company s inability to assess underwriting risk accurately could reduce its net income the company s success is dependent on its ability to assess accurately the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained 
if the company fails to assess accurately the risks it retains  the company may fail to establish the appropriate premium rates and the company reserves may be inadequate to cover its losses  requiring augmentation of the company s reserves  which in turn could reduce the company s net income 
decreases in the fair market value of fixed income securities may greatly reduce the value of the company s investment portfolio  and as a result  the company s financial condition may suffer at december   million of the company s million investment portfolio was invested in fixed income securities 
the fair market value of these fixed income securities and the investment income from these fixed income securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
with respect to the company s investments in fixed income securities  the fair market value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  while net investment income realized by the company from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
in addition  actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
an investment has prepayment risk when there is a ri sk that the timing of cash flows that result from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates 
historically  the impact of market fluctuations has affected the company s financial statements 
because all of the company s fixed income securities are classified as available for sale  changes in the fair market value of the company s securities are reflected in the company s accumulated other comprehensive income 
no adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates 
therefore  interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect the company s stockholders equity  total comprehensive income and or cash flows 
if the company fails to comply with extensive state and federal regulations  the company will be subject to penalties  which may include fines and suspension and which may adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition the company is subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision 
most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors 
this regulation  generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which the company does business  relates to  among other things approval of policy forms and premium rates  standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements  which are a measure developed by the national association of insurance commissioners and used by state insurance regulators to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized  licensing of insurers and their agents  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates  restrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy  requiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders  requiring certain methods of accounting  periodic examinations of the insurance group s operations and finances  prescribing the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed  and requiring reserves for unearned premium  losses and other purposes
