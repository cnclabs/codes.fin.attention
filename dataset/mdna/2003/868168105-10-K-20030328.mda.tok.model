annual report on form k part i item business continued we obtain our requirements for other materials through numerous suppliers with whom we have established trade relations 
when an outside supplier produces components for our products  we normally own  or have the right to purchase  the tools and dies located in the supplier s facilities or have developed alternative sources 
patents and licensing agreements we currently hold patents for eight of our inventions and have one patent pending 
we have a policy of applying for patents when new products or processes are developed 
however  we believe our success is more dependent upon manufacturing and engineering skills and the quality and market acceptance of our products  than upon our ability to obtain and defend patents 
in  we entered into a licensing agreement for the cobapress technology that requires certain royalty payments including payments upon the sale of parts manufactured using that technology 
research and development our policy is to continuously review  improve and develop engineering capabilities so that customer requirements are met in the most efficient and cost effective manner available 
we strive to achieve this objective by attracting and retaining top engineering talent and by maintaining the latest state of the art computer technology to support engineering development 
two fully staffed engineering centers  located in van nuys  california  and fayetteville  arkansas  support our research and development manufacturing needs 
we also have a technical center in detroit  michigan  which maintains a complement of engineering staff centrally located near our largest customers 
we are currently engaged in approximately fifty nine engineering programs for the development of oem wheels  chrome wheels  and aluminum suspension components for future model years  including several wheel models for japanese  latin american and european oem manufacturers 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
amounts expended during the three years ended december  were  in   in and  in developmental costs associated with our new aluminum suspension and related underbody component business are included in these research and development costs  and are the primary reason for the increased costs in and compared to government regulation safety standards in the manufacture of vehicles and automotive equipment have been established under the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of we believe that we are in compliance with all federal standards currently applicable to oem suppliers and to automotive manufacturers

annual report on form k part i item business continued environmental compliance our manufacturing facilities  like most other manufacturing companies  are subject to solid waste  water and air pollution control standards mandated by federal  state and local laws 
violators of these laws are subject to fines and  in extreme cases  plant closure 
we believe our facilities are substantially in compliance with all standards presently applicable 
however  cost related to environmental protection may continue to grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations and our ongoing commitment to rigorous internal standards 
the cost of environmental compliance was approximately  in   in and  in we expect that future environmental compliance expenditures will approximate these levels and will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position 
see item legal proceedings for information concerning our involvement with certain united states environmental protection agency activities 
competition the business sectors in each of our product areas are highly competitive based primarily on price  technology  quality  delivery and overall customer service 
we are one of the leading suppliers of aluminum road wheels for oem installations in the world 
we supply approximately to percent of the aluminum wheels for installation on passenger cars and light trucks in north america 
for the model year  according to ward s automotive yearbook  an auto industry publication  aluminum wheel installation rates on passenger cars and light trucks produced in north america rose to percent  compared to percent in  continuing a long term upward trend 
however  in recent years  this rate has slowed  only increasing percent from percent for the model year 
accordingly  future growth will be more dependent upon additional future wheel contracts 
our primary competitor in the north american market is hayes lemmerz international  inc of romulus  michigan  which has announced that it has declared chapter bankruptcy and its stock has been delisted 
employees as of december   we have approximately  full time employees including at our joint venture manufacturing plant in hungary 
at the present time the only employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are the employees at our wheel polishing facility in tijuana  mexico
