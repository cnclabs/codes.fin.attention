the following analysis provides information about the major components of the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of eastern virginia bankshares evb and attempts to identify trends and material changes that occurred during the reporting periods 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements certain information contained in this discussion may include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are generally identified by phrases such as the company expects  the company believes or words of similar import 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks including  but not limited to  changes in general economic and business conditions  interest rate fluctuations  competition within and from outside the banking industry  new products and services in the banking industry  risk inherent in making loans such as repayment risks and fluctuating collateral values  problems with technology utilized by the company  changing trends in customer profiles and changes in laws and regulations applicable to the company 
although the company believes that its expectations with respect to the forward looking statements are based upon reliable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results  performance or achievements of the company will not differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies general the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ substantially from the historical factors that we use 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i sfas  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses 
table of contents be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and ii sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of the collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has two basic components the formula allowance and the specific allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the formula allowance uses historical loss as an indicator of future losses and  as a result  could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
however  since the history is updated with the most recent loss information  the errors that might otherwise occur are mitigated 
the formula allowance is revised as deemed appropriate to capture losses that are attributable to economic events and industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in the specific allowance 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss 
historical loss information  current level of nonaccrual loans  current level of unsecured loans past due to days and the fair market value of collateral are used to estimate these losses 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates

for comparative purposes  income from tax exempt securities is adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 
tax equivalent securities income is further adjusted by the tefra adjustment for the disallowance as a deduction of a portion of total interest expense related to the ratio of average tax exempt securities to average total assets 
this adjustment results in tax exempt income and yields being presented on a basis comparable with income and yields from fully taxable earning assets 
net interest margin represents the company s net interest income divided by average earning assets 
changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income

interest sensitivity evb s primary goals in interest rate risk management are to minimize fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets and to increase the dollar amount of net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets 
these goals are accomplished by managing the interest sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities in a specific time interval 
interest sensitivity gap is managed by balancing the volume of floating rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating rate assets  by keeping the average maturity of fixed rate asset and liability contracts reasonably consistent and short  and by routinely adjusting pricing to market conditions on a regular basis 

table of contents the company generally strives to maintain a position flexible enough to move to equality between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  which may be desirable when there are wide and frequent fluctuations in interest rates 
matching the amount of assets and liabilities maturing in the same time interval helps to hedge interest rate risk and to minimize the impact on net interest income in periods of rising or falling interest rates 
when an unacceptable positive gap within a one year time frame occurs  maturities can be extended by selling shorter term investments and purchasing longer maturities 
when an unacceptable negative gap occurs  variable rate loans can be increased and more investment in shorter term investments can be made 
interest rate gaps are managed through investments  loan pricing and deposit pricing

residential real estate mortgages made up of the loan portfolio as compared to at year end and at year end the company s hanover bank subsidiary has experienced significant loan growth in both and with the dynamics of that market increasing evb s market share of commercial real estate loans and real estate construction loans 
commercial real estate loans increased from of the total loan portfolio at year end to at year end 
real estate construction loans accounted for of total loans outstanding at year end and at year end the company s losses on loans secured by real estate have historically been low  averaging thousand in net charge offs per year over the last five years 
consumer loans are the second largest component of evb s loan portfolio 
consumer loans were of the loan portfolio at year end  and at year end and respectively 
this portfolio component 
table of contents consists primarily of installment loans 
net consumer loans for household  family and other personal expenditures totaled million at year end  down thousand from million at year end  while still up from million at year end 
general economic conditions and intense competition including zero interest financing by the automotive industry caused the decrease in consumer loans in commercial and agricultural loans are designed specifically to meet the needs of small and medium size business customers 
this category of loans increased million in total loans outstanding at year end compared to  with the percentage to total loans decreasing to of the total loan portfolio from at year end consistent with its focus on providing community based financial services  evb generally does not make loans outside of its principal market region 
the company does not engage in foreign lending activities  consequently the loan portfolio is not exposed to the sometimes volatile risk from foreign credits 
evb further maintains a policy not to originate or purchase loans classified by regulators as highly leveraged transactions or loans to foreign entities or individuals 
the company s unfunded loan commitments  excluding credit card lines and letters of credit  at year end totaled million  up million from million at december  unfunded loan commitments excluding million in home equity lines are used in large part to meet seasonal funding needs which are generally higher from spring through fall than at year end 
historically  evb s loan collateral has been primarily real estate because of the nature of our market region 
asset quality the company s allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the amount needed to provide for potential losses in the loan portfolio 
in determining adequacy of the allowance  management considers the company s historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  specific impaired loans  the overall level of nonaccrual loans  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  and economic conditions 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
because the risk of loan loss includes general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses can only be an estimate 
evb experienced a meaningful improvement in its loan quality in as nonperforming assets at year end decreased million or  compared to year end  and net charge offs for the year decreased thousand or 
each of evb s subsidiary banks has a loan review function consisting of bank officers and board members 
additionally an independent credit review consultant performs a monthly review of loans for southside bank and hanover bank 
bank of northumberland  inc maintains a review process by senior credit personnel and utilized an independent loan review firm to conduct an intensive review during as a matter of policy  the company places loans on nonaccrual status when a loan becomes days past due as to principal and interest  regardless of how well the loan may be collateralized 
the company utilizes a risk based evaluation system based on loan type  and payment history to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on this loan review process and analysis 
the company s decrease in charge offs and nonperforming assets in allowed evb to lower its loan loss allowance ratio to at year end  compared to at december  and at year end  respectively 
for the same periods the loan losses allowance to nonaccrual loans ratio was  and  indicating that the allowance was adequate with respect to nonaccrual loans 
the allowance for loan losses is subject to regulatory examinations which may take into account such factors as methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer companies identified by regulatory agencies

nonperforming loans at year end consisted of million of loans secured by real estate in the company s market area  thousand of commercial and agricultural loans and thousand of consumer loans 
based on estimated fair values of the related collateral  management considers the nonperforming real estate loans recoverable  with any individual deficiency well covered by the allowance for loan losses 
no interest is accrued on loans placed in a nonaccrual status  and any unpaid interest previously accrued on such past due loans is reversed when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status

although trends for credit quality factors improved significantly in  it is likely that evb will continue provisions for loan losses in the primary factor for additional provision is growth in the loan portfolio and the level of net charge offs and nonperforming loans

table of contents deposits the company has historically focused on increasing core deposits to reduce the need for other borrowings to fund growth in earning assets 
core deposits provide a low cost  stable source of funding for the company s asset growth 
interest rates paid on deposits are carefully managed to provide an attractive market rate while at the same time not adversely affecting the net interest margin 
borrowing through the federal home loan bank of atlanta is utilized for funding when the cost of borrowed funds falls below the cost of new interest bearing deposits

table of contents capital resources capital resources are managed to maintain a capital structure that provides the company the ability to support asset growth  absorb potential losses and to expand evb s franchise when appropriate 
capital represents original investment by shareholders along with retained earnings and provides financial resources over which management can exercise greater control as compared to deposits and borrowed funds 
regulatory authorities have adopted guidelines to establish minimum capital standards 
specifically the guidelines classify assets and balance sheet items into four risk weighted categories 
the minimum regulatory total capital to risk weighted assets is of which at least must be tier capital  defined as common equity and retained earnings 
at december   evb had total capital of and a tier ratio of  both far in excess of regulatory guidelines and the amount needed to support each subsidiary s banking business 
capital is carefully managed as the financial opportunities of a high capital base are weighed against the impact of the return on equity ratio

table of contents liquidity liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  deposits with other banks  federal funds sold  investments and loans maturing or repricing within one year 
evb s management of liquid assets provides a liquidity level which management believes is sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and to meet its customers credit needs 
at december   million or of total earning assets were due to mature or reprice within the next year 
evb also maintains additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements 
federal funds borrowing arrangements with major regional banks combined with lines of credit with the federal home loan bank totaled millionatdecember  at year end  the company had million of fhlb borrowings outstanding 
inflation in financial institutions  unlike most manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rate movement is not necessarily tied to movements in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates 
accounting rule changes in december   the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position  accounting by certain entities including entities with trade receivables that lend to or finance the activities of others  to reconcile and conform the accounting and financial reporting provisions established by various aicpa industry audit guides 
this statement is effective for annual and interim financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued statement  rescission of fasb no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the amendment to statement eliminates an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
this statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
the provisions of this statement related to the rescission of statement shall be applied in fiscal years beginning after may  the provisions of this statement related to statement are effective for transactions occurring after may   with early application encouraged 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires recognition of a liability  when incurred  for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity 
the liability should be measured at fair value 
the provisions of the statement are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  effective january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
additionally  the statement requires that acquired intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles be separately recognized if the benefit of the asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  and amortized over their estimated useful life 
branch acquisition transactions were outside the scope of the statement and therefore any intangible asset arising from such transactions remained subject to amortization over their estimated useful life 

table of contents in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions 
the statement amends previous interpretive guidance on the application of the purchase method of accounting to acquisitions of financial institutions  and requires the application of statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
to branch acquisitions if such transactions meet the definition of a business combination 
the provisions of the statement do not apply to transactions between two or more mutual enterprises 
in addition  the statement amends statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  to include in its scope core deposit intangibles of financial institutions 
accordingly  such intangibles are subject to a recoverability test based on undiscounted cash flows  and to the impairment recognition and measurement provisions required for other long lived assets held and used 
the adoption of statement no   and did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of statement no 
 in december the statement amends statement no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  the statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
finally  this statement amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about the effects of stock options in interim financial information 
the amendments to statement no

the company continues to record stock options under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and has not adopted the alternative methods allowable under statement no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
evb s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the company s management is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of evb s subsidiary banks and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
guidelines established by management are reviewed by the board of directors 
it is evb s policy not to engage in activities considered to be derivative in nature such as futures  option contracts  swaps  caps  floors  collars or forward commitments 
evb considers derivatives as speculative which is contrary to the company s historical or prospective philosophy 
evb does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
it does not hold in its loan and security portfolio investments that adjust or float according to changes in the prime lending rate which is not considered speculative  but necessary for good asset liability management 
asset liability risk management the primary goals of asset liability risk management are to maximize net interest income and the net value of evb s future cash flows within the interest rate limits set by the asset liability committee alco 
interest rate risk measurement interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complimentary measures  static gap analysis  earnings simulation modeling and net present value estimation 
while each of the interest rate risk measurements has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the company  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 

table of contents static gap gap analysis measures the amount of repricing risk embedded in the balance sheet at a point in time 
it does so by comparing the differences in the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
a gap is defined as the difference between the principal amount of assets and liabilities  adjusted for off balance sheet instruments  which reprice within a specific time period 
the cumulative one year gap  at year end was which is within the policy limit for the one year gap of plus to minus of total earning assets at a combined company level 
core deposits and loans with noncontractual maturities are included in the gap repricing distributions based upon historical patterns determined by statistical analysis  based upon industry accepted assumptions including the most recent core deposit defaults set forth by the ffiec federal financial institutions examination council 
the gap repricing distributions include principal cash flows from residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in the time frames in which they are expected to be received 
mortgage prepayments are estimated by applying industry median projections of prepayment speeds to portfolio segments based on coupon range and loan age 
earnings simulation the earnings simulation model forecasts one year net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effects on income of alternative interest rate scenarios against earnings in a stable interest rate environment 
this type of analysis is also most useful in determining the short run earnings exposures to changes in customer behavior involving loan payments and deposit additions and withdrawals 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects net income would increase approximately of stable rate net income if rates were to fall immediately by two percentage points 
it projects a decrease of approximately if rates rise by two percentage points 
management believes this reflects a liability sensitive interest risk for the one year horizon 
this dynamic simulation model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time  in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from historical analysis and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry median estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
noncontractual deposit growth rates and pricing are assumed to follow historical patterns 
the sensitivities of key assumptions are analyzed at least annually and reviewed by management 
net present value the net present value npv of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
interest rate risk analysis using npv involves changing the interest rates used in determining the cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in npv is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
at year end  a basis point immediate increase in rates is estimated to decrease npv by 
additionally  npv is estimated to decrease by if rates fall immediately by basis points 
analysis of the average quarterly change in the treasury yield curve over the past ten years indicates that a parallel curve shift of basis points or more is an event that has less that a chance of occurrence 
as with gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in npv analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving mortgage prepayments and the assumptions about expected attrition of the core deposit portfolios 
these assumptions are applied consistently across the different rate risk measures

stable rate the earnings simulation model indicates that if all prepayments  calls and maturities of the securities portfolios expected over the next year were to remain uninvested  then the current liability sensitive position would be lessened
