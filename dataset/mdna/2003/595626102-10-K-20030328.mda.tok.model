table of contents a business transformation costs for fiscal   and are described in note of notes to financial statements 
b in fiscal  the company began a process to transform itself from a worldwide operator of both franchised and company operated shops into a focused operator of the north american franchise system 
this transformation included the sale of midas franchised and company operated shop businesses in europe and australia  and a shift in focus to the licensing of midas trademarks and know how outside of north america 
within north america  the transformation included changing consumer perceptions about midas and the products and services offered  improving relationships with franchisees and redeploying assets to improve returns

as recently as  exhaust and brake repair services constituted of midas shop revenues in the us market 
in the mid s  automobile manufacturers began to employ non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems  which extended the average original equipment exhaust system life from three to years 
as a result  beginning in the mid s the company s core exhaust replacement 
table of contents business began to experience sustained revenue declines in both the wholesale parts distribution and retail midas shop businesses 
in response to these trends  the company has been transforming its existing business model in order to improve the long term health and success of the company and the midas system 
this transformation is centered on two consistent initiatives redefine the north american midas shop business model in order to offset the dramatic declines in the retail exhaust business  the company and its franchisees developed a new retail business model that was called new midas 
in may  the company began an aggressive marketing effort to launch the new midas and to change consumer perception that midas was a muffler and brake specialist only 
the new midas program incorporates an updated shop appearance  expanded services to include climate control and general maintenance  and new operational standards for building long term relationships with customers 
today  most midas shops offer exhaust  brake  suspension  air conditioning  batteries and a number of other routine maintenance services 
the company s business strategy is to continue to expand these service offerings in the future and to reposition the midas brand as a source for total car care 
after disposing of its company operated shop operation in the late s  the company determined in that it needed to re establish a company operated shop network 
the company believes that owning and operating some midas shops is a required element of a successful franchise system 
such ownership allows for the orderly transition of franchises  provides a platform for the test marketing of new products and services  enables the company to upgrade under performing locations and helps to accelerate the midas system transition into the new products and services offered by the new midas operating program 
upon acquisition  the company typically upgrades shop equipment  further expands services offered  installs new point of sale software  adjusts hours of operation  upgrades the quality of technicians  and enhances local marketing efforts 
during  the company acquired shops from various franchisees  including the purchase of locations in from one franchisee that was in chapter bankruptcy proceedings 
as of december   the total number of company operated shops was in the fourth quarter of  the company made the decision to stop the aggressive growth of the company shop operation and to bring focus to the program by closing unprofitable shops and reducing the number of markets served 
as part of this program  shops will be closed in fiscal and additional shops will be re franchised 
the company will continue to evaluate all company operated shop locations and may re franchise additional owned locations where it is determined that the company s return on investment objectives are best achieved through re franchising instead of ownership 
in the future  the company may from time to time acquire north american shops from franchisees as they become available 
however  the company does not believe that growth of the company operated shop business is an essential component of its north american midas system strategy 
redesign of the wholesale distribution channel the company believes that the wholesale parts distribution channel is an integral component of the midas franchising system 
midas franchisees currently rely on midas to provide a substantial portion of their parts needs at prices below other wholesale distributors 
additionally  the wholesale distribution channel funds and supports the midas lifetime guarantee on high quality genuine midas products  which is a cornerstone of midas relationship with its franchisees and retail customers 
however  declining sales of traditional midas wholesale products  driven mostly by the increased durability of exhaust systems and increased just in time parts sourcing by traditional wholesale customers  has necessitated that midas redesign its wholesale distribution channel in order to preserve the benefits it provides to the midas system while substantially improving its profitability 
initially  in response to the declining sales of traditional midas wholesale products  and consistent with the new midas program rollout to the franchise system  the company sought to expand its wholesale product offerings 
new products added in the past several years include batteries  climate control products  performance 
table of contents exhaust  ceramic brake products  starters and alternators and maintenance items 
additionally  the company has moved aggressively to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency throughout its traditional wholesale distribution network 
since  the company has reduced its network of north american distribution centers from to and opened one new centralized distribution facility for exhaust products 
the company has also invested heavily in technology to support the reconfigured distribution network 
despite the enhancements to the traditional wholesale distribution network  wholesale parts sales have continued to decline 
as midas shops have expanded their mix of service offerings at retail  these shops have entered new categories that require a different type of part sourcing 
while the core categories of exhaust  brakes  shocks and struts can be sourced from midas traditional distribution centers  new categories such as climate control  electrical  and some maintenance services require parts that are too costly for a typical midas shop to carry in inventory or are used too infrequently to replenish from a midas distribution center 
therefore  midas shops continue to purchase many of these parts locally on a just in time basis even though they may be purchased at a lower cost through the traditional midas wholesale channel with its weekly shipments to franchisees 
based on current sales trends in the traditional wholesale channel  the company needs to further rationalize its distribution center network 
as a result  three additional distribution centers will be closed in during  in direct response to the changing needs of the aftermarket auto repair industry  midas established parts warehouse  inc pwi  a network of small quick delivery sites that distribute parts on a just in time basis to midas dealers and to customers outside the midas system 
the company s previous strategic plan called for a rapid expansion of the pwi business in order to leverage the existing distribution network and migrate the traditional wholesale business from a stocking dealer platform based on weekly deliveries to a just in time delivery model  while providing a supply chain solution for the new services being added by midas dealers at retail 
to date  this strategy has not provided the expected results  and the investment required to complete the build out of the pwi network is substantial 
even when completely built out  the pwi network of stores would be small relative to established just in time automotive suppliers such as autozone  napa and carquest 
therefore  the company believes that the midas system is better served by providing a ready made sourcing solution to midas shops through a strategic alliance with one or more of these types of distributors 
in the fourth quarter of  the company determined that it would sell and liquidate all of the pwi sites operating at that time 
since december   the company has agreed to sell locations to a regional automotive parts distributor and has closed unprofitable sites 
following the sale of the locations  the company will operate pwi sites 
the remaining sites are expected to be sold or closed during the company continues to explore ways in which it can offer midas dealers the benefits of the traditional midas wholesale distribution channel  while providing to midas system dealers an advantageous  low cost just in time parts sourcing solution 
in addition to considering further reductions in the number of distribution centers utilized by its traditional wholesale network  the company is currently evaluating a number of strategic alternatives including outsourcing certain wholesale distribution functions to various third parties 
the company intends that any change in midas wholesale distribution channel operation will improve company profitability and return on net investment  while maintaining support for franchisee operations 
the company s ongoing business transformation process has resulted in fiscal charges  which are summarized in the following tables business transformation charges by strategic initiative fiscal year disposition of parts warehouse  inc closure and re franchising of certain company operated shops redesign of the wholesale distribution network severance and administrative costs total business transformation charges

fiscal reporting periods fiscal years  and were all comprised of weeks 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal sales and revenues for fiscal increased million or from fiscal to million  as a decline in replacement part sales was offset by increased sales from company operated shops 
replacement parts sales for fiscal decreased million to million from million in fiscal replacement parts sales through the company s traditional wholesale distribution channel declined 
this performance was driven mostly by continued erosion in demand for replacement exhaust systems and increased just in time parts sourcing by traditional wholesale customers 
at the same time  replacement parts sales through the company s pwi wholesale distribution channel  which serves the just in time replacement parts needs of midas dealers and customers outside the midas system  increased by 
sales growth in the pwi channel primarily reflected an expanded network of pwi sites compared with the prior year 
within the retail auto service business  fiscal revenues from company operated shops increased million over fiscal the sales increase reflects substantial growth in the average number of company operated shops in operation during fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in comparable shop sales 
royalty revenues and license fees were down from fiscal due to an increase in the number of company operated shops  whose sales no longer generate royalty revenue  as well as a decline of approximately in system wide comparable shop midas retail sales 
revenues from real estate rentals declined slightly 
the company s gross profit margin before inventory write down increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this improvement was primarily due to the increase in higher margin retail sales from company operated shops  as well as improvement in margins on replacement part sales as a result of a more favorable product and customer mix in the company s pwi sales channel 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that it would dispose of its pwi operations through the sale of locations and liquidation of inventory and recorded an inventory write down of million to reduce its pwi related inventory to its expected net realizable value 
as a result  the company s gross profit declined million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and the company s gross profit margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal 
table of contents selling  general and distribution expenses for fiscal increased million  or over fiscal to million 
this increase consists of incremental operating expenses associated with additional company operated shops and pwi sites  as well as unusually high medical claim and workers compensation expenses experienced during the second half of the year 
partially offsetting these higher costs were lower operating expenses associated with sales declines in the traditional wholesale parts distribution business and lower corporate administrative expense resulting from actions taken to reduce corporate staff in january as a result of these factors  selling  general and distribution expenses as a percentage of total sales and revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal in fiscal  the company recorded business transformation charges of million related to the implementation of its ongoing business transformation initiatives 
these charges are described above and in note of notes to financial statements 
as a result of the above  operating income declined million from income of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal these changes caused a decrease in operating income margin from in fiscal to a negative in fiscal excluding the above described business transformation costs incurred for the write down of inventory and business transformation charges  the company s operating income decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as result of higher debt levels associated with funding the company s expansion of its company operated shop and pwi businesses over the past two years

replacement parts sales decreased million to million from million in erosion in shipments of traditional wholesale categories  including exhaust systems and brake products  continued  while sales for the pwi wholesale distribution channel increased 
within the retail auto service business  revenues from company operated shops rose million as the company added shops during the year  including shops in the fourth quarter 
royalty revenues and license fees were virtually unchanged from the prior year  as midas achieved its first system wide comparable store sales increase since revenues from real estate rentals declined slightly 
the company s gross profit declined million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal however  the company s gross profit margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this improvement was primarily due to the increase in higher margin retail sales from company operated shops  as well as improvement in margins on replacement part sales as a result of a more favorable product mix in the company s pwi sales channel 
selling  general and distribution expenses for fiscal increased million or from fiscal to million 
this increase consists of million in incremental operating expenses associated with additional company operated shops and additional pwi sites  partially offset by lower operating expenses associated with sales declines in the traditional wholesale parts distribution business 
as a result of these factors  selling  general and distribution expenses as a percentage of total sales and revenues increased from in 
table of contents fiscal to in fiscal in addition  the company recorded business transformation charges of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reflect a reduction in the company s workforce and the write off of certain impaired assets 
in fiscal  the company incurred business transformation charges of million  reflecting an increase the company s allowance for bad debts and the implementation of an early retirement program 
as a result of the above changes  operating income declined million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal these changes caused a decrease in operating income margin from in fiscal to in fiscal excluding business transformation charges from both fiscal periods  operating income declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as result of higher debt levels 
the company s effective tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  as the fiscal tax expense included a non recurring benefit of million related to the disposition of the company s australian operations 
as a result of the above items  net income decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal liquidity  financial condition and capital resources following is a summary of the company s cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for fiscal and  respectively in millions fiscal year net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents the company s operating activities used net cash flow of million during fiscal compared to million of cash flow generated in fiscal the year over year change of million was primarily due to a million reduction in operating income exclusive of business transformation costs and changes in assets and liabilities requiring million of cash in as compared to only million of cash in fiscal business transformation costs of million did not dramatically impact cash flow  as the charge included million of non cash charges to write down inventory and accounts receivable and to reflect the impairment of goodwill and fixed assets 
of the remaining million of business transformation charges  only million had been paid out as of fiscal year end 
the million change in assets and liabilities during fiscal use of cash consists primarily of a million reduction in accounts payable due to the expiration of vendor terms granted to support the growth in inventory  a million decrease in accrued expenses due to the timing of advertising payments  and an million increase in accounts receivable 
the fiscal change in assets and liabilities use of cash consists primarily of a million increase in inventory related to the growth of parts warehouse  inc and expansion of product lines  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable due to favorable vendor terms and a million increase in accrued expenses 
investing activities used million in cash during fiscal compared to using million during fiscal fiscal investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures for ongoing systems development and the upgrade of company operated shops acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal in 
table of contents fiscal  investing activities consisted of million in capital investments and million in cash paid for acquired businesses 
capital investments of million related to ongoing system projects  including the installation of the company s new erp system  the upgrade of acquired company operated shops  the expansion of the pwi wholesale network  and normal maintenance capital expenditures 
the million in cash paid to acquire businesses during fiscal reflected the company s purchase of midas shops from franchisees  and the purchase of the assets of progressive automotive systems  a provider of automotive industry point of sale software sold under the name rowriter 
net cash generated by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash generated of million in fiscal in fiscal  the cash was generated primarily through the sale of owned properties during the fiscal second quarter 
the company sold these properties to realty income corporation  a publicly traded real estate investment trust reit 
simultaneous to the sale  midas leased these properties from realty income and the sites continue to be leased to midas franchisees under currently existing leases 
midas received approximately million in net proceeds from the transaction 
because these properties will continue to generate rents to midas  there will be no effect on revenues 
as a result of this transaction  the company recorded a finance lease obligation on the balance sheet equal to the sale price  and no gain on the sale of the properties was recognized 
the properties remain on the balance sheet at their historic cost and will continue to be depreciated over the remainder of their useful lives 
proceeds from this transaction were used to fund the working capital requirements of the business 
in fiscal  million in cash was generated primarily through an increase in borrowing on the company s unsecured revolving line of credit  partially offset by the repayment of short term borrowings and the payment of dividends to shareholders 
the company suspended the payment of dividends to shareholders in fiscal and does not expect that it will resume dividend payments in the near future 
during fiscal  the company expects to improve liquidity through the implementation of its business transformation initiatives 
these include the disposition of pwi  the closing and re franchising of certain company operated shops  and the closing of additional wholesale distribution centers 
the company expects to generate increased cash flow from these actions as a result of improved operating profitability  reduced wholesale network inventory requirements and cash proceeds from the sale of pwi locations and the liquidation of associated pwi inventory 
the company s revolving credit facility was scheduled to expire in january prior to its expiration  the lenders extended the maturity date to march  on march   the company entered into a comprehensive debt restructuring with its existing lenders

the interest rate on the term loan b is fixed at cash interest paid quarterly plus paid in kind pik  which is added to principal and due at maturity 
on january   the pik interest rate can be increased to if the company fails to meet certain financial objectives 
availability under the revolving credit facility is based on a borrowing base  which takes into consideration the company s inventory and accounts receivable levels 
the revolving credit facility is senior to both the term loan a and term loan b 
the new facilities require maintenance of certain financial covenants including maximum allowable leverage and minimum net worth 
no scheduled amortization payments are due 
the facilities require mandatory prepayments from i all proceeds from the sale or disposition of assets of the company other than the sale of inventory in the normal course of business  and ii of excess cash flow as defined in the loan agreement  both of which are subject to minimum liquidity requirements

such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied  the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates  and the consistent application of those accounting principles 
due to the type of industry in which the company operates and the nature of its business  the following accounting policies are those that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a more comprehensive list of the company s significant accounting policies is presented in note of notes to financial statements 

table of contents inventory valuation as a manufacturer and distributor of automotive aftermarket parts  inventory represents a substantial portion of the total assets of the company 
therefore the company must periodically evaluate the carrying value of its inventory to assess the proper valuation 
this includes having adequate accruals to cover losses in the normal course of operation  provide for excess and obsolete inventory  and ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
in performing this evaluation the company considers historical data such as actual loss experience  past and projected usage  and actual margins generated from sales of its products 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company determined that it would dispose of its pwi business 
in evaluating the inventory related to the pwi business  in addition to the factors cited above  the company also considered independent third party appraisals of the pwi inventory as well as offers made by potential buyers 
valuation of receivables the company records receivables due from its franchisees and other customers at the time the sale is recorded in accordance with its revenue recognition policies 
these receivables consist of amounts due from the sale of products  royalties due from franchisees  rents and other amounts 
the future collectability of these amounts can be impacted by the company s collection efforts  the financial stability of its customers  and the general economic climate in which it operates 
the company applies a consistent practice of establishing an allowance for accounts that it feels may become uncollectible through reviewing the historical aging of its receivables and by monitoring the financial strength of its franchisees and other customers 
where the company becomes aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg where it is in financial distress or has filed for bankruptcy  the company specifically reserves for the potential bad debt to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
the valuation of receivables is performed on a quarterly basis 
in connection with the disposal of the pwi business  the company has also considered the reduced collection efforts that result from a store closing as well as the increased likelihood that customers will not pay amounts due 
pensions the company has non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees 
the company s funding policy for the us plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income act of  plus any additional amounts the company may deem to be appropriate 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a minimum liability is required to be established on the balance sheet representing the amount of unfunded accrued pension cost 
this represents the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
when it is necessary to establish an additional minimum pension liability  an amount is recorded as an intangible asset limited to unrecognized prior service cost 
any amount in excess of unrecognized prior service cost is recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity through cumulative other comprehensive income  net of tax  in the balance sheet 
as of december   the company has recorded an intangible pension asset of million and an accumulated reduction to shareholders equity of million  net of tax 
to account for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 the company must make three main determinations at the end of each fiscal year first  it must determine the actuarial assumption for the discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining this rate  the company looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments and periodic published rate ranges 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the discount rates used by year 

table of contents second  the company must determine the actuarial assumption for rates of increase in compensation levels used in the calculation of the accumulated and projected benefit obligation for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
in determining this rate the company looks at its historical and expected rates of annual salary increases 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the rates of increase in compensation levels used by year 
third  the company must determine the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption that is used to determine the expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return is deferred under sfas no 
and is recognized to net periodic pension cost over a five year period 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the expected long term rates used by year 
carrying values of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill represents the amount paid in consideration for an acquisition in excess of the net tangible assets acquired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company did not amortize goodwill for new acquisitions made after june  for acquisitions prior to that date  the company continued to amortize goodwill through the end of fiscal the company conducts tests for impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that an asset s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
midas evaluates the carrying values of its long lived assets to be held and used in the business by reviewing undiscounted cash flows by operating unit 
such evaluations are performed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining lives of the related assets does not exceed the carrying values of the assets  the carrying values are adjusted for the differences between the fair values and the carrying values 
additionally  in the case of fixed assets related to locations that will be closed or sold  the company writes fixed assets down to their estimated recovery value 
self insurance reserves the company is largely self insured with respect to workers compensation  general liability  and employee medical claims 
in order to reduce its risk and better manage its overall loss exposure  the company purchases stop loss insurance that covers individual claims in excess of the deductible amounts 
the company maintains an accrual for the estimated cost to settle open claims as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these estimates take into consideration the historical average monthly claim volume  the average cost for settled claims  current trends in claim costs  changes in the company s business and workforce  and general economic factors 
these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis  or more frequently if factors dictate a more frequent review 
impact of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment under certain circumstances  and written off when impaired  rather than being amortized as previous standards required 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
in the third quarter of fiscal for new acquisitions 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
for previously acquired intangibles in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position at the time of its adoption 
the amortization of goodwill in fiscal was approximately thousand  or per diluted share  net of taxes 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed a second evaluation of goodwill as a result of a decline in the company s operating performance and a change in strategic direction 
the results of the evaluation indicated that a portion of goodwill related to its company operated shop business was impaired 
the 
table of contents performance of this reporting unit  which was established during  has not met management s expectations  primarily due to economic factors  the competitive nature of the unit s services and operational execution issues 
the company measured the amount of impairment based on a comparison of the fair value to its carrying value 
fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow and cost methodology 
accordingly  the company recognized a million charge in the fourth quarter of to write down goodwill primarily related to the company operated shop business 
the company plans to close certain under performing locations and to re franchise others  and expects the performance of the remaining locations to improve over the next several years 
on january  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
sfas no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations  reporting the effects of the disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in apb no 
to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any impact on the company s financial statements at the time of its adoption 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed a second evaluation of long lived assets as a result of a decline in operating performance and a change in strategic direction 
given the company s decision to dispose of its pwi business  close certain unprofitable company operated shops  and close three additional distribution centers  the company determined that the fixed assets associated with the affected locations were impaired 
the company measured the amount of the impairment based on a comparison of the estimated recovery values of these assets to their carrying values 
accordingly  the company recognized an million charge in the fourth quarter of to write down fixed assets related to the locations that will be closed or sold 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
supersedes the guidance provided under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize liabilities and costs associated with exit or disposal activities initiated after december   when they are incurred 
prior to sfas no 
 companies were required to recognize the costs at the time management committed to a plan to exit an activity 
during the fourth quarter of  management and the board of directors of the company committed the company to certain exit and disposal activities including the disposal of the pwi locations  the closing of certain company operated shops  the closing of certain distribution centers  and a reduction in the company s workforce 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of million in under the provisions of eitf if sfas no 
had been effective  certain of these costs would not have been accrued 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no
