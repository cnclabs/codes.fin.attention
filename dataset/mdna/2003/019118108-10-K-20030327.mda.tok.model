allied earned net profits of million per share basic and per share diluted in compared to net profits of million per share basic and per share diluted in and net profits from continuing operations of million per share basic and diluted in forward looking statements as set forth in item of this report  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the company and the industries in which it operates 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions future factors which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
future factors include substantial reliance on mecar s principal customers to continue to acquire mecar s products on a regular basis  the cyclical nature of the company s military business  rapid technological developments and changes and the company s ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely  cost effective basis  the ability of the company to successfully continue to expand its business base  the mix of products services  domestic and foreign

in addition  such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general domestic and international economic conditions including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations  increasing competition by foreign and domestic competitors  including new entrants  and other future factors 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
management has identified the company s critical accounting estimates which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and operating results of the company and require subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses include revenue recognition via the percentage of completion method  goodwill and intangible asset valuation  inventory valuation and the assessment of the valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax reserves 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on fixed price contracts for which we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
this method is used by mecar  microwave  and seaspace for substantially all of their sales contracts 
approximately  and of consolidated revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method during  and  respectively 
the value of contracts in process at december  and were million and million and the gross margin recognized on these contracts through december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
under the percentage of completion method revenue is recognized on these contracts as work progresses during the period  based on the amount of actual cost incurred during the period compared to total estimated cost to be incurred for the total contract 
management reviews these estimates on at least a quarterly basis and the effect of any change in cost estimates are reflected in cost of sales in the period in which the change is identified 
if the contract is projected to create a loss  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period such loss first becomes known 
a number of internal and external factors affect our cost of sales estimates  including labor rates and efficiency variances  material usage variances  delivery schedules and testing requirements 
additionally  as inventory items increase in age  obsolete and excess items are charged to cost of sales if the economic conditions of the future sales potential of that inventory warrant a charge 
while we believe that the systems and procedures used by 
table of contents the subsidiaries  coupled with the experience of their management teams  provide a sound basis for our estimates  actual result will differ from management s estimates 
the complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
the company adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on accounting for business combinations and goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal year accordingly  the company no longer amortizes goodwill from acquisitions  but continues to amortize other acquisition related intangibles with definitive lives and other costs 
as of december   the company has million of goodwill recorded in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheet 
in conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting rules for goodwill  the company completed a goodwill impairment analysis in the th quarter of and did not determine that an impairment charge to earnings was required 
as required by the new rules  the company will perform a similar review each year  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future cash flows discounted at the company s weighted average cost of capital 
the estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
if market conditions in the company s related businesses fail to meet expectations  if they become unfavorable  if it causes the entities business model to negatively change or if it negatively impacts revenue or cost  the company may incur charges for the impairment of goodwill in future periods 
for intangible assets with definitive lives  the company amortizes the cost over the estimated useful life and assesses any impairment by estimating the future cash flow from the associated asset in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as of december   the company had million of intangible assets with definitive lives recorded in other assets  which includes patents  customer lists  trademarks  etc 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flow related to these assets decreases in the future or the useful life is shorter than originally estimated  the company may incur charges to reflect the impairment of these assets 
the impairment is based on the estimated discounted cash flow associated with the assets or the related business segment 
impairment could result if the underlying technology fails to gain market acceptance  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance or if the market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on a first in  first out basis 
the company s inventory includes raw materials  work in process and finished goods of million as of december  the company reviews its recorded inventory and estimates a write down for obsolete or slow moving items to their net realizable value 
the write down is based on current and forecasted demand and the age of the item  and therefore  if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
the company is subject to taxation by federal  state and international jurisdictions 
the company s annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involve a significant amount of management judgment and are based on the best information available at the time 
the actual income tax liabilities to the jurisdictions with respect to any fiscal year are normally determined within nine months after the financial statements have been published 
the company believes that it has recorded adequate liabilities and reviews those balances on a quarterly basis 

table of contents judgment is also applied in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as foreign tax credit carryovers will not be realized  a valuation allowance is established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
accordingly  if the company s prospects or financial results were to change thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment will be applied to determine changes to the amount of the valuation allowance required to be in place on the financial statements in any given period 
the company continually evaluates strategies that could allow the future utilization of its deferred tax assets 
acquisitions in june and july   allied acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of titan and seaspace in exchange for aggregate consideration of  shares of common stock and cash of million 
allied used the purchase method of accounting to account for these acquisitions 
accordingly  the results of titan and seaspace are included in the company s consolidated financial statements since the date of each acquisition 
the purchase price for each acquisition was apportioned to the acquired assets and liabilities at fair value 
the excess purchase price over estimated fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas  goodwill related to these acquisitions is not being amortized 
other intangible assets acquired in these acquisitions were recorded at fair value and are being amortized over their useful lives 
trends in operations the ordnance manufacturing and electronic security segments continued to be the major contributors to the profitability of the company in the environmental safety security and software  training simulation segments were added in the second and third quarters of the current year and had a minor positive impact on the profits generated during the company is evaluating further expansion in each segment via strategic acquisitions 
mecar operated its facilities throughout without any operational capacity issues  although continued growth could require mecar to seek additional capacity in both plant and labor 
the majority of mecar s revenues resulted from orders from its traditional customer base 
the unit was awarded a united states foreign military sales contract for the benefit of one of their customers that will continue to have an impact on revenue and profit over the next months 
mecar s gross margin declined in from the record levels achieved in due to a one time development contract which had a very favorable impact on results 
the vsk group recorded another profitable year in the business unit contributed approximately million in revenue and million in net income to consolidated activity 
three new units impacted operations during the year 
microwave was acquired by the company on december  and produced a full year s worth of activity in the unit generated million in revenue and million in net income during the first year of full operations 
microwave anticipates significant growth over the next several years as the demand for its integrated surveillance solutions accelerates to meet the needs of national  state and local law enforcement agencies and for homeland defense 
titan and seaspace were acquired in june and july  respectively  in and combined contributed slightly over million in revenue and million in net income 
orders activity within microwave is heavily dependent on the timeliness of the department of homeland security reorganization as well as the congressional budget approval process which authorizes operational funds for that particular department 
during the fourth quarter of  microwave experienced a softening of orders attributed to the above mentioned homeland security reorganization 
the company expects that the congressional funding process for homeland security will be completed during and microwave will be an active participant on government contracts issued by agencies within the department 

table of contents in future periods  allied s operations will continue to be materially impacted by mecar s ability to obtain orders from its current customer base  by mecar s ability to expand into other international markets  by allied s ability to successfully diversify into other strategic business segments 
trends in liquidity and capital resources in june  the company sold a convertible debenture and stock purchase warrant for million 
approximately million of the proceeds were used by the company to complete the titan and seaspace acquisitions with a portion of the remaining funds directed to support the working capital needs of microwave and titan 
the debenture is repayable in ten monthly installments beginning in mid and is expected to be repaid from allied cash and or dividends received from mecar and or the vsk group 
future cash flow will be generated from internal operations and financial support from the european bank syndicate 
seaspace has access to a working line of credit in the amount of million that is available to sustain short term working capital needs 
allied has made additional investments in microwave to support its working capital as a result of the delay in receipt of homeland security orders 
the parent company is financially supported by management fees received by each subsidiary and by dividends primarily from mecar and vsk 
allied received approximately million in fees and dividends from it operating subsidiaries in for the long term  the generation of positive cash flow from core operations will depend upon mecar s ability to continue to receive orders from its traditional customer base  the ability of mecar to maintain positive operating margins and the ability of allied to strategically expand its business segments 
liquidity working capital  which includes restricted cash  was approximately million at december   which is an increase of million from the december  level 
the increase in working capital is attributed to the sale of the million convertible subordinated debenture and the company s profitable operations in the company s current working capital is required for operations  to support credit facility agreements  to fulfill contractual obligations related to orders  and to continue to implement the company s growth plans 
during and  allied funded its operations principally with internally generated cash  with the issuance of a convertible debenture and a european credit facility that was renewed in the first quarter of that gave mecar access to approximately million of short term credit and bank guarantees 
on june   the company sold to an accredited investor million of an subordinated debenture convertible into shares of the company s common stock at per share 
the investor also acquired warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
accounts receivable at december  increased over levels by million principally due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of  which included activity from microwave  titan and seaspace 
accounts receivable of microwave  titan and seaspace totaled million at the end of costs and accrued earnings on uncompleted contracts increased by million from year end levels as a result of increased amounts of work in progress at the end of inventories increased by million from levels  primarily from the additions of microwave  titan and seaspace 
fair value of foreign exchange contracts increased primarily as a result of the larger nominal amounts of hedge contracts outstanding in and the stronger euro in relation to the us dollar 
the asset is offset by an identical deferred credit in current liabilities 
intangibles increased from levels due to the titan and seaspace acquisitions 

table of contents mecar typically obtains orders for its ammunition and weapon systems that require credit facilities to provide import letters of credit  advance payment guarantees and performance bonds 
these needs have been met in the last few years via agreements with a five member international bank syndicate of which the lead bank is based in belgium 
while the bank syndicate agreement provides that mecar is responsible to repay the syndicate for amounts paid by the banks pursuant to the guarantees bonds  the financial terms stipulate that all such obligations be secured  in part  by a cash pledge 
at december   mecar s lenders had issued million of guarantees performance bonds and mecar had pledged million of cash 
the bank syndicate agreement provides the banks the right to review and approve each proposed mecar contract before agreeing to provide the necessary letters of credit  guarantee and or bond 
while management believes that it will be able to finance additional mecar contracts using the bank syndicate structure  there can be no assurance that such financing will be unconditionally and permanently provided 
the bank syndicate agreement provides i lines of credit aggregating million for tax prepayments and working capital and ii a facility for guarantees bonds to support customer contracts of million 
the financial lending terms and fees are denominated in euros and the dollar equivalents will fluctuate according to global economic conditions 
the revised bank agreement  as executed in march of  eliminates most restrictions on cash transfers by mecar to allied or other allied group companies 
however  the new agreement imposes two new financial covenants requiring mecar to maintain minimum net worth and working capital levels 
as of december   mecar was not in violation of either of these two bank covenants 
mecar s obligations under the bank syndicate agreement continue to be collateralized by a pledge of mecar s assets and add a second mortgage on mecar s facility 
the agreement includes allied s pledge to support mecar so that it remains in compliance with its total borrowing obligations 
mecar has a mortgage loan with one member of its bank pool and this loan is guaranteed by a foreign government agency 
the outstanding balance was approximately million at december  principal and interest payments on the mortgage loan extend through january   and the loan includes a prepayment penalty clause 
the vsk group operated throughout solely from cash generated from normal business activity 
the vsk group is obligated on several mortgages and other long term obligations with december  balance aggregating million 
microwave titan operated in from cash generated from operations and cash infusions by allied 
seaspace operated in from cash generated from operations 
on january   eleven member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
commencing january   the participating countries introduced euro notes and coins and began to withdraw all other existing currencies from circulation 
allied will continue to evaluate all issues involving the introduction of the euro as further accounting  tax and governmental legal and regulatory guidance becomes available 
based on current information and allied s current assessment  allied does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material and adverse effect on its business or financial condition 
in september  allied s board of directors authorized the purchase of up to  shares of allied s common stock 
during and  allied repurchased  and  shares of its common stock in market transactions 
the company did not repurchase shares in or and does not anticipate repurchasing shares of company stock in calendar year 
table of contents allied s ability to cover its anticipated future operating  debt servicing and capital requirements is dependent upon its ability to generate positive cash flow from the operations of its subsidiaries and to be able to dividend a portion of available cash back to the parent company 
capital resources allied spent million in on capital equipment as compared with million in and million in  respectively 
the expenditures in were primarily for operating machinery and building upgrades 
management currently anticipates that it will spend approximately million  across all the operations  on capital expenditures in for additional upgrades to its facilities and equipment 
a majority of the capital expenditures for are planned for mecar and will be spent on production equipment 
the planned capital additions will be denominated in euros and will be financed by the existing credit facility or new lease facilities negotiated by each business unit 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as described herein and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  allied has contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect its financial condition 
however  based on management s assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of the material contractual obligations and commercial commitments of allied  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material adverse effect on allied s financial condition or results of operations 
the following table identifies material contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations convertible debenture operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations results of operations allied had revenues from continuing operations of million in compared to million in and to million in  respectively 
allied earned profits from continuing operations of million in  million in and million in the following table sets forth  for the years ended december   and  certain items from allied s consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue revenue cost and expenses cost of sales selling and administrative research and development operating income 
table of contents other income deductions interest income interest expense other net earnings before discontinued operation and income taxes income tax expense earnings from continuing operations discontinued operation net earnings the company s operating results are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as financial results of its european subsidiaries are translated from euros into us dollars upon consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  revenues and other operating results  when translated by the company  may differ materially from comparable operating results for prior periods 
the following discussion of the components of the results of operations applies to allied as a whole unless reference is made to a particular segment 
revenues allied s consolidated revenues from continuing operations for increased million  or  from the prior year 
revenues from continuing operations for decreased million  or  from revenues 
revenues by segment amount amount amount millions ordnance manufacturing electronic security environmental safety security software  training simulation 
table of contents the positive fluctuation within the ordnance manufacturing segment was solely the result of increased activity within mecar 
this included work on the us foreign military sales contract awarded in early revenue was slightly affected by a stronger euro relative to the us dollar which positively benefited the segment s results by approximately 
the fluctuation in mecar s revenues from the amount realized in results principally from a change in mecar s revenue base 
in  mecar began to receive subcontracts from a distributor as opposed to direct contracts from the end user customer 
as a result  in the majority of non fms revenue was through the distributor subcontracts 
these subcontracts generally have lower revenue value than mecar s traditional direct end user sales contracts  however  this subcontract arrangement does not reduce the company s gross margins since mecar s cost of sales is reduced as a result of its agreement with the distributor 
electronic security segment revenues increased by million in and  like the impact within ordnance manufacturing  were affected by the stronger euro 
microwave was added to the electronic security segment in and contributed million to the segment activity 
revenues for the environmental safety security and the software  training simulation segments constitute sales generated by titan and seaspace  respectively 
these two units were consolidated into the operations as of june and july respectively and posted a combined million in sales for these segments 
cost of sales cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for was approximately compared with for and for the increase in production costs relative to those incurred in was primarily the result of a very favorable development contract in with above average margins 
a majority of the margins generated by this one contract were recognized during the third and fourth quarters of the remaining profit on that contract was recognized by mecar in the first quarter of and had a small impact on the overall margin activity for the year 
the relative improvement in the cost of sales for goods sold in compared to resulted primarily from productivity improvements and the increase in the subcontracts awarded via the distributor as explained under revenues both within mecar 
certain fees  selling expenses and other customer related expenses in connection with direct sales to customers are not incurred on distributor subcontracts 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased by million from the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to the additions of microwave  titan and seaspace 
administrative costs at mecar and vsk only increased million from microwave was consolidated on a full year basis while titan and seaspace were second and third quarter additions 
the effect of the elimination of goodwill amortization  as a result of the implementation of sfas  was immaterial to consolidated activities during the year 
in prior years  the amortization costs were associated with goodwill balances maintained by arc europe and vsk 
selling and administrative expenses increased by in over expenses incurred in the increase was due to increased employment related charges at the parent company and increased costs associated with the review of acquisition opportunities 

table of contents research and development research and development costs increased by million from  primarily due to a full year of activity of microwave 
the costs incurred by titan and seaspace were immaterial to the overall results 
however  the company expects that costs will increase at a modest rate for microwave  titan and seaspace in future periods 
research and development costs incurred in decreased by from the level as a result of a portion of the mecar r d staff being diverted to work on production projects 
interest income interest income decreased in the current year by million 
the decrease was a result of lower rates and less interest earned on cash principally at mecar 
interest income was essentially unchanged during the periods through interest expense interest expense was lower in the current year by million 
the decrease was a result of lower interest charges on outstanding bank debt at mecar  offset by interest costs associated with the convertible debenture issued in june 
interest expenses incurred in increased by approximately compared to the amount incurred in and were largely due to increased borrowings at mecar 
other net other net results were million in gain and in loss 
the results primarily included currency gains based on the strength of the euro within the european community over the past fifteen months 
the euro is the base currency for the european operating units 
pre tax profit from continuing operations pre tax profit loss by segment millions ordnance manufacturing electronic security environmental safety security software  training simulation corporate and other 
table of contents as described above  mecar s pre tax profit was affected by the lack of a similar development contract in to replace the effect that contract had on operations in approximately of the revenue and profits on that development contract were recorded in the net profits for within the electronic security segment were slightly higher in the current period compared to the prior year 
a portion of the improvement was due to lower production costs and the effects of a favorable exchange rate 
profits at microwave also contributed to the increase 
electronic security s pre tax profit increase in from its level was due to increased operating margins at the vsk group as a result of production efficiencies and lower administrative expenses 
pre tax profit loss for the environmental safety security segment and the software  training simulation segment are comprised of pre tax profit loss from operations of seaspace and titan  respectively  from their dates of acquisition 
the activities from the two segments had an immaterial impact on pre tax profits in the results for these two segments should show improvement in subsequent quarters at a modest rate of growth 
income taxes the effective income tax expense attributable to continuing operations in  and was  and  respectively  primarily due to foreign rate differentials and permanent tax differences 
the statutory tax rate for the european subsidiaries is expected to be reduced by the belgium parliament from to and should become effective for net earnings from continuing operations the company earned profits of million  million and million in  and  respectively  from continuing operations 
discontinued operations all results from discontinued operations reported by allied relate to the operations of bri and have been reported net of income tax expense or benefits 
the company s profit of million from discontinued operations is principally comprised of gain on the sale of bri 
impact of year through march   the company has not experienced any significant problems related to the yk issue 
recent accounting pronouncements see note a to allied s consolidated financial statements for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
except for the elimination of periodic amortization of goodwill and the substitution therefore of periodic goodwill impairment testing  allied does not anticipate that any of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial results 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity allied manages its debt and its available cash considering available investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
at year end  allied had approximately million of fixed rate indebtedness 
allied has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness 
cash available for investment is typically invested in short term funds  which generally mature in days or money market funds 
in general  such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the carrying amounts approximate market value 
it is the company s practice to hold these investments to maturity 
assuming year end variable rate debt and cash available for investment  a one percent change in interest rates would impact net interest income by less than million 
exchange rate sensitivity allied maintains operations in several foreign countries 
approximately of the company s revenue from continuing operations was derived from operations outside the united states 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movement in foreign currency rates 
allied uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates associated with some  but not all  of its contracts in which the expenses for providing services are incurred in currency other than the functional currency of allied s foreign subsidiaries or payments on contracts are made by the customer in another currency 
the objective of these contracts is to hedge fixed obligations to reduce the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on allied s foreign subsidiaries operating results 
additionally  allied s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between the allied subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
allied does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in the value of the euro would impact reported net earnings by approximately million 
allied does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor does allied hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
allied regularly reviews its hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change its hedging program
