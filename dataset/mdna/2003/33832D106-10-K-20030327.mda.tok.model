item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were incorporated in delaware in april and reincorporated in maryland in september we were formed as a owned subsidiary of senior housing 
effective july   we assumed the operations of healthcare communities from two bankrupt former tenants of senior housing 
pursuant to tax laws applicable to reits  senior housing engaged fsq  inc  an independent operating company formed by our managing directors  to manage these communities 
at the time we assumed operations of these communities  we had not received substantially all of the required licenses for these communities 
as a result  for the period from july   through december   we accounted for the operations of these communities using the equity method of accounting and we only recorded the net income from these operations 
thereafter  we obtained all necessary licenses to operate these communities  and on january   we began to consolidate the results of operations of these communities 
on december   senior housing distributed substantially all of our shares to its shareholders in a spin off transaction and we became a separately traded public company 
also  on january   in order to acquire the personnel  systems and assets necessary to operate these communities  we acquired fsq  inc by merger 
since we succeeded to substantially all of the business formerly conducted by subsidiaries or units of two former tenants of senior housing  these subsidiaries and units are considered to be our predecessors 
we have included the financial statements of these predecessors in this annual report on form k and discuss their results of operations 
our predecessors financial statements are entitled certain mariner post acute network communities operated by subsidiaries of mariner post acute network referred to herein as mariner predecessor  and forty two communities acquired by senior housing properties trust from integrated health services  inc referred to herein as integrated predecessor 
our revenues consist primarily of payments for services provided to residents at our communities 
the payments are either made by the residents  their families or insurers  referred to as private pay revenues  or by the medicare and medicaid programs 
on a pro forma basis  after giving full year effect to the communities we leased or acquired in  for the year ended december   private pay revenues represented of our total revenues 
our expenses consist primarily of rent  wages and benefits of personnel  food  supplies  insurance and other resident care costs  as well as taxes  and other property related costs 
our historical results of operations as described above  until completion of the spin off  we operated as a subsidiary of senior housing 
our past operations as senior housing s subsidiary prior to differ from our and current operations as an independent public company 
specifically  in the and periods we operated only communities for senior housing  which owned the real estate as well as the operations 
effective december   we began to lease these communities now communities from senior housing which continued to own the real estate 
in january  we began to lease an additional communities from senior housing that are managed by msls 
in april  we acquired and began to operate five additional senior living communities 
in october  we began to operate additional owned or leased senior living communities 
also  our principal source of financing for us as a subsidiary of senior housing prior to was intercompany advances from senior housing  an entity with financial resources substantially in excess of ours 
because of these differences  we believe that our historical results of operations for periods prior to described below are not comparable to our operations or our expected future operations 
the following tables present an overview of our portfolio for the years ended december  and which shows the differences in the size of our operations during these periods and same store results for the communities operations  including periods prior to their acquisition by us

this increase is due primarily to higher per diem charges to residents and slightly higher occupancy 
revenues from residents at the communities we operated at december   were million for  an increase of over revenues from residents of million in including revenues which relate to periods prior to our operation of some of these communities 
this increase is principally attributable to higher per diem charges to residents offset somewhat by a decline in occupancy 
about of our revenues from residents in were received from medicare and medicaid  compared to in this decrease is due largely to our lease of and acquisition of communities during  all of which are focused on services to residents who pay with private resources 
since  a medicare prospective payment system has generally lowered medicare rates paid to senior living communities including many that we operate 
in october  temporary increases in medicare payment rates expired 
our medicare revenues totaled million and million during and  respectively 
these amounts do not include communities where operations were ceased by us in this increase is due to the addition to our business in january of communities which are operated for us by msls and an increase in medicare revenue at the nursing homes which we operated in both and caused primarily by the increase in medicare resident days at these nursing homes 
because the medicare rate increases expired in october  assuming our census of medicare residents is comparable to  we estimate that our revenues received from medicare in will decline by approximately million over revenues received from medicare 
our communities which are managed by msls generated million  or  of their revenue in from medicare  versus million  or  in our nursing homes generated million  or of their revenue in from medicare  versus million  or  in the independent and assisted living communities which we operate for our own account do not participate in the medicare program and generate no medicare revenues 
some state governments have reduced or are planning to reduce medicaid rates to address state budget shortfalls 
in  of our total revenues  or million  were medicaid revenues  versus million in  an increase of 
these amounts do not include revenues at communities where our operations ceased in this increase is due to the addition to our business in january of communities operated for us by msls which generate some medicaid revenues and an increase in medicaid revenue at our nursing homes caused primarily by the increase in medicaid rates at these nursing homes 
the magnitude of possible future medicaid rate reductions cannot currently be estimated  but it may be material 
our communities which are managed by msls generated million  or of their revenue in  from medicaid  versus million  or  in  from medicaid 
our nursing homes generated million or of their revenue in from medicaid  versus million  or in the independent and assisted living communities which we operate for our own account do not participate in the medicaid program and generate no medicaid revenues 
interest income increased by  in compared to due to earnings on higher cash balances in the period 
expenses for were million  an increase of over expenses of million for our wages and benefits costs increased from million to million  or  primarily due to expenses at the communities we leased or acquired in other operating expenses  which include utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  insurance and community level administrative costs  rose from million to million or  again primarily due to expenses at the communities we leased or acquired in during  msls did not manage any communities for us and we were a subsidiary of senior housing that did not lease any communities 
as a result  we did not incur management fees to msls or rent expense in community level operating expenses related to the communities we operated throughout and  were million and million  respectively  an increase of 
this increase is principally attributable to higher insurance premiums  an increase in reserves for the self funded portion of our insurance programs and higher wage and benefit costs  which were partially offset by a decrease in expenses from our reduced use of higher cost  third party staffing 
community level operating expenses at the communities that we operated at december   were million for  an increase of over community expenses for including expenses which relate to periods prior to our operation at some of these communities 
this increase resulted principally from higher insurance premiums  an increase in reserves for the self funded portion of our insurance programs and higher wage and benefit costs 
our general and administrative expenses for were million  a decrease of over  primarily due to operational start up costs incurred during which we did not incur in which were only partially offset by increased costs in associated with operating as a separate  publicly owned company and the legal and other costs incurred in connection with our litigation with marriott and msls 
depreciation expense in was million  an increase of over depreciation expense of million in the increase is attributable to our purchase of communities in loss from discontinued operations for was million  an increase of million over the loss in this increase was the result of reserves recorded for medicaid receivables due from the state of connecticut related to community closure costs and an asset impairment charge related to a closed community 
as a result of the factors described above  our net loss for was million  compared to a profit of  in our net loss per share in was 
assuming the shares outstanding as of december   were outstanding for all of  our earnings per share would have been for year ended december   versus year ended december  we did not begin to operate the senior living communities of our predecessors or generate revenue until july  therefore  our results for are not comparable to revenues for were million 
on a combined basis  the two predecessor entities had revenues of million for this increase was due mainly to an increase in the average daily rate received during these periods 
expenses for were million 
on a combined basis  the predecessor entities had expenses of million for the decrease is due primarily to rent and interest expenses which were included in the expenses of our predecessors but were zero in because  after senior housing s repossessions and foreclosures  rent and interest payments on our predecessors leases and mortgages ceased 
period from april  date our operations commenced through december  this period was our first period of operations and  therefore  there is no comparable period 
during we accounted for our investment in these operating businesses using the equity method of accounting 
as a result  the reported revenues include only our equity in earnings of these investees 
revenues for were million and represent the net amount of net patient revenues in excess of expenses of these operations for the period 
net patient revenues at the operating businesses for the period ended december   were million and expenses incurred for the period were million 
historical results of operations mariner predecessor our mariner predecessor conducted operations of communities leased from senior housing for a period of time in the operations of the mariner predecessor during the period prior to its acquisition by senior housing differ from our operations as follows the business of the mariner predecessor was conducted by its then parent  mariner post acute network  inc  an entity with a capital structure  corporate overhead costs  and operating systems substantially different than ours 
during the period of mariner s operation of this business  significant write offs of goodwill and other long lived assets of the mariner predecessor occurred and mariner filed for bankruptcy 
we believe that because of these differences  these historical results of operations are not comparable to our operations 
specifically  the historical operations include revenues and operating expenses for only communities  one of which has since been closed  while currently we generate revenues and incur operating expenses at communities  depreciation expenses which relate to real estate and amortization expenses which relate to goodwill  while we have less depreciable assets and no amortizing goodwill  expenses related to allocation of corporate overhead by the parent of these operations  while we incur different corporate expenses  rent expense under a lease which has been cancelled  charges for impairments of long lived assets of substantial amounts  while we have incurred lesser such charges  and interest expense incurred on debt which is different from our debt and internal costs 
in  our mariner predecessor had revenues of million  incurred expenses of million  and realized a net loss of million 
historical results of operations integrated predecessor our integrated predecessor conducted operations of communities leased from or mortgaged to senior housing for a period of time in the operations of the integrated predecessor during the period prior to its acquisition by senior housing differ from our operations as follows the business of the integrated predecessor was conducted by its then parent  integrated health services  inc  an entity with a capital structure  corporate overhead costs  and operating systems substantially different than ours 
during the period of integrated health services operation of this business  significant write offs of goodwill and other long lived assets of the integrated predecessor occurred and integrated health services filed for bankruptcy 
we believe that because of these differences  the historical results of operations are not comparable to our operations 
specifically  the historical operations include revenues and operating expenses for only communities  one of which has since been closed  while we currently generate revenues and incur operating expenses at communities  depreciation expenses which relate to real estate and amortization expenses which relate to intangible assets  while our depreciable and amortizable assets are less substantial  expenses related to corporate overhead and management fees charged by the parent of the integrated predecessor  while we incur different corporate expenses  rent expense under a lease which has been canceled  charges for impairments of long lived assets of substantial amounts  while we have incurred lesser such charges  and interest expense incurred on debt which is different from our debt and internal costs 
in  our integrated predecessor had revenues of million  incurred expenses of million and realized a net loss of million 
liquidity and capital resources our total assets at december   were million compared to million at december  the increase is primarily a result of our capital raising  acquisition and leasing activities in at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million available on our revolving credit facility 
for and cash provided by and used in operating activities was million and  respectively  cash used in investing activities was million and million  respectively and cash provided by financing activities was million and million  respectively 
we lease communities from senior housing 
our leases with senior housing require us to pay a total of million of minimum rent annually 
percentage rent on these leases begins in and we expect percentage rent to be modest relative to our total rental obligations 
if events of default under the leases occur  senior housing has the ability to accelerate our rent payments 
at march   we believe we are in compliance with the terms of our leases 
our primary source of cash to fund operating expenses  including rent  principal and interest payments on our mortgage debt and routine capital expenditures  is our revenues from services to residents at our communities 
changes in laws and regulations which impact medicare or medicaid rates  on which some of our communities rely  may materially affect our future results 
in october temporary increases in medicare payment rates expired 
assuming our census of medicare residents is comparable to  we estimate that our revenues received from medicare in will decline by approximately million over revenues received from medicare 
some of the states in which we operate have reduced or are planning to reduce medicaid funding to address state budget shortfalls 
the magnitude of combined medicare and medicaid revenue reductions cannot currently be estimated  but it may be material 
we expect recent increases in the costs of insurance  especially tort liability insurance  workers compensation and employee health insurance costs  which are affecting the senior living industry  will continue to have a material adverse impact upon our future results of operations 
as discussed in note to our financial statements  a failure by integrated health services  the united states department of health and human services or the state of connecticut to make payments that we believe are due to us would have a material adverse impact upon our future results and deny us access to those cash proceeds to which we believe we are entitled 
it is also possible that our litigation with marriott and msls and potential transfer of the related management agreements  as discussed in note to our financial statements  may have an adverse impact on our financial results or increase our working capital requirements 
despite these contingencies  however  we believe that a combination of some or all of our efforts to increase revenues  contain or reduce costs  our ability to borrow on the revolving credit facility  our ability to obtain financing from senior housing for capital improvements made to communities leased from senior housing and the possibility of sales or financings of our owned communities will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  operating expenses  rent payments to senior housing  debt service and capital expenditures in the short term  or next months  and in the normal course of our business for the foreseeable future 
debt instruments and covenants in october  we entered into a revolving credit facility 
the interest rate on borrowings on this facility is libor plus a spread 
the maximum amount available under this facility is million  and is subject to limitations based upon qualifying collateral 
the borrower under this facility is a subsidiary that we organized with the intention that it be bankruptcy remote 
certain of our other subsidiaries sell or contribute their healthcare accounts receivable to the borrower on a true sale basis and make certain representations and other undertakings in favor of the borrower in connection with each sale 
the seller subsidiaries have granted security interests in their assets to secure their obligations to the borrower 
we guarantee the obligations of the seller subsidiaries obligations to the borrower subsidiary and have pledged the stock or membership interests in each of the seller subsidiaries to the borrower 
the borrower has in turn collaterally assigned these undertakings  guarantees and collateral to the revolving credit facility lenders  and has granted a security interest in the purchased receivables and all of its other assets to secure its obligations under the facility 
the facility is available for acquisitions  working capital and general business purposes 
the facility contains covenants and events of default requiring the maintenance of collateral  minimum net worth and certain other financial ratios  among other customary provisions 
the accounts receivable collateralizing the facility totaled million  net of allowances of million  as of december  in certain circumstances and subject to available collateral and lender approvals the maximum amounts which we may draw under this credit agreement may be increased to million 
as of december   no loans were outstanding under the facility 
at march   we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under this revolving credit agreement and no loans are outstanding 
in connection with our october acquisition of a community  we assumed hud insured mortgages totaling approximately million 
the weighted average interest cost on this debt is per year 
principal and interest is due monthly through these mortgages are not recourse to us and are secured by one of our owned communities with living units 
a portion of this debt is refinanceable in june and all of this debt may be refinanced beginning in this mortgage debt was recorded  as required by generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  at its estimated fair value on the date we assumed it  or million 
the approximate  difference between our contractual obligation and our carry value is being amortized over the estimated period the mortgages will remain outstanding 
these mortgages contain standard hud mortgage covenants 
at march   we believe we are in compliance with all material covenants of these mortgages 
related parties on december   senior housing distributed substantially all of our shares to its shareholders 
in order to effect this spin off and to govern relations after the spin off  we entered into agreements with senior housing  and others 
among other matters  these agreements provide we may not waive our corporate charter restrictions on ownership of more than of any class of our equity shares by any person or group without the prior consent of senior housing and our determination that the exception to these restrictions would not cause a default under any of our leases  if any person or group acquires more than of our voting stock and upon other change in control events  senior housing may terminate our rights under our leases with senior housing  so long as we are a tenant of senior housing  we will neither permit any person or group to acquire more than of our voting stock or permit the occurrence of other change in control events  as defined  nor will we take any action that  in the reasonable judgment of senior housing or hrpt properties trust  might jeopardize the tax status of senior housing or hrpt properties as a reit  so long as we maintain our shared services agreement with rmr or are a tenant under a lease with senior housing then we will not acquire or finance real estate without first giving senior housing or any other publicly owned reit or other entity managed by rmr the right to acquire or finance real estate investments of the type in which senior housing or the other entities  respectively  invest  and upon senior housing s purchase of the communities managed by msls  we would acquire operating assets associated with these communities and begin to lease these communities from senior housing for minimum annual rent of million 
as of december   we leased of our senior living communities from senior housing for aggregate annual minimum rent of million 
in the future  we may transact additional business with senior housing 
we believe that our current leases with senior housing were entered into on reasonable commercial terms 
however  because of the historical and continuing relationships which we have  these continuing and possibly expanding business relationships may not be arm s length and may not be on the same or as favorable terms as we enter with third parties with whom we did not have such relationships 
during we acquired seven senior living communities from a third party for million 
prior to this acquisition senior housing waived its right to acquire these assets  subject to a continuing right to acquire or finance these assets in the event we determine to sell or finance them 
to finance the cash portion of our purchase  we sold a senior living community to senior housing  which we purchased in april  for million  its approximate carrying value 
simultaneous with our acquisition  senior housing acquired eight other senior living communities from the same third party 
we acquired operating assets and liabilities related to these eight communities 
we began to lease these eight communities and the community we sold to senior housing for minimum annual rent of million 
the terms of this transaction with senior housing were negotiated on our behalf by our independent director who is not on the board of senior housing 
as discussed more fully in item legal proceedings  during  we and senior housing became jointly involved in litigation with marriott and msls  the operator of of the senior living communities which we leased from senior housing beginning in we believe that marriott and msls have materially breached the management agreements for these communities 
we also believe that the management agreements may be terminated if msls is sold to sunrise 
marriott announced that it had entered an agreement to sell msls to sunrise on december  however  the factual and legal issues involved in this litigation are complex and the final outcome of this litigation cannot be predicted 
also  this litigation is likely to be expensive to conduct and the total amount of this expense cannot be estimated at this time 
we have an agreement with rmr to provide administrative services to us 
rmr is owned by messrs 
martin and portnoy  who are our managing directors and members of our board of directors 
rmr is compensated at an annual rate equal to of our total revenues 
aggregate fees paid to rmr for services during were million 
the fact that rmr has responsibilities to other entities  including our landlord  senior housing  could create conflicts and  in the event of such conflicts between senior housing and us  the shared services agreement allows rmr to prefer its responsibility to senior housing 
the terms of our shared services agreement are annually reviewed and approved by our directors who are not owners or employees of rmr  and we believe these terms are commercially reasonable 
however  because of these historical and continuing relationships our shared services agreement may not be arm s length and may not be on the same or as favorable terms as we might enter with third parties with whom we did not have such relationships 
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are also officers and employees of rmr 
these officers devote a substantial majority of their business time to our affairs and the remainder to rmr s affairs which are separate from ours 
we believe the compensation we pay to these officers reflects their division of business time 
however  periodically  these individuals may divide their business time differently than they do currently and their compensation from us may become disproportionate to this division 
during we acquired fsq  an entity owned by messrs 
martin and portnoy  in a merger transaction that was entered into as part of our spin off from senior housing 
we acquired all of the stock of fsq and messrs 
martin and portnoy each received  of our common shares 
the board of trustees of senior housing received an opinion from an internationally recognized investment banking firm  to the effect that the merger was fair  from a financial point of view  to us 
the terms of this merger were approved by senior housing s trustees other than messrs 
martin and portnoy 
messrs 
martin and portnoy own the building in which our headquarters is located 
our lease for space was originally executed by fsq when fsq was owned by messrs 
martin and portnoy 
this lease expires in during  we paid rent under this lease of  we believe that this lease and the rent rate were commercially reasonable at the time they were entered 
however  because of this historical and continuing relationship among us  fsq and messrs 
portnoy and martin  this lease may not be arm s length and it may not be on the same or as favorable terms as we might have with third parties with whom we did not have such relationships 
in march  senior housing terminated a lease for a nursing home community in st 
joseph  missouri and evicted the tenant  which was not current in its rent obligations to senior housing 
we have agreed to manage this nursing home until it is re leased or sold 
we will be paid a management fee of of the gross revenues from this nursing home 
until march   mr 
portnoy was a partner of sullivan worcester llp  our counsel and counsel to senior housing  rmr and affiliates of each of the foregoing  and he received payments from that firm during in respect of his retirement 
critical accounting policies our most critical accounting policies concern revenue recognition  our assessment of the net realizable value of our accounts receivable  the realizability of long term assets  accounting for long term care contracts  accounting for business combinations and our assessment of reserves related to our self insurance programs 
our revenue recognition policies involve judgments about medicare and medicaid methodologies 
these judgments are based principally upon our experience with these programs 
we recognize revenues when services are provided and revenues are earned and these amounts are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts 
some medicare and medicaid revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment 
our policies for valuing accounts receivable involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including consideration of the age of the receivable  the terms of the agreements with our residents or their third party payors  the resident or payors stated intent to pay  the resident or payors financial capacity and other factors which may include litigation or appeal proceedings 
we monitor our long term assets to determine whether any impairment of these assets may have occurred 
if the facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred  we evaluate the asset s carrying value to determine whether an impairment charge is required 
this process includes a review of historical and projected future financial results realized or to be realized from the affected assets  market for sale and the like 
this process requires that estimates be made and errors in our judgments or estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements 
at certain of our facilities  we offer long term care contracts under which residents pay a one time deposit in exchange for reduced charges during their stay 
the one time deposits may be refundable or non refundable  or partially refundable and partially non refundable 
we record such deposits as a long term obligation and amortize the non refundable portion of such deposits into revenue over our estimate of the periods during which future services will be provided 
we base these estimates on our experience  actuarial information and other factors 
during  we began to lease or acquire communities 
we accounted for each of these transactions as a purchase business combination in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
purchase accounting requires that we make certain judgments and estimates based on our experience  including determining the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and the fair value of liabilities assumed 
some of our judgments and estimates are also based upon published industry statistics 
our policies for determining reserves for the self funded part of our insurance programs and for our self insurance programs involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including projected settlements for pending claims  known incidents which we expect may result in claims  estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims and incidents  claims experience  estimated litigation costs and other factors 
we also periodically receive and rely upon recommendations from professional consultants in establishing these reserves 
in the future we may need to revise the judgments  estimates and assessment we use to formulate our critical accounting policies to incorporate information which is not now known 
we cannot predict the effect changes to these premises underlying our critical accounting policies may have on our future results of operations  although such changes could be material and adverse 
inflation and deflation inflation in the past several years in the united states has been modest 
future inflation might have both positive or negative impacts on our business 
rising price levels may allow us to increase occupancy charges to residents  but may also cause our operating costs  including our percentage rent  to increase 
also our ability to increase prices related to medicare and medicaid reimbursements might be limited despite inflation 
deflation would likely have a negative impact upon us 
a large component of our expenses consist of minimum rental obligations to senior housing 
accordingly we believe that a general decline in price levels which could cause our charges to residents to decline would likely not be fully offset by a decline in our expenses 
seasonality our business is subject to modest effects of seasonality 
during the calendar fourth quarter holiday periods nursing home and assisted living residents are sometimes discharged to join family celebrations and admission decisions are often deferred 
the first quarter of each calendar year usually coincides with increased illness among nursing home and assisted living residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals 
as a result of these factors  nursing home and assisted living operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of a calendar year and lesser earnings in the first and fourth quarters 
we do not believe that this seasonality will cause fluctuations in our revenues or operating cash flow to such an extent that we will have difficulty paying our expenses  including rent  which do not fluctuate seasonally 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk through our monitoring of available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged since december  other than as described below we do not now anticipate any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this risk in the future 
changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt  while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
for example based upon discounted cash flow analysis  if prevailing interest rates were to decline by and other credit market considerations remained unchanged  the market value of our million mortgage debt outstanding on december   would increase by about million  and  similarly  if prevailing interest rates were to increase by  the market value of our million mortgage debt would decline by about million 
our revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates and matures in october as of december   we had zero outstanding under this revolving credit facility 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are subject to interest at libor plus a spread 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of any outstanding floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
for example  if the maximum amount of our credit facility of million were drawn and interest rates decrease or increase by per annum  our interest expense would decrease or increase by  per year  or per share  respectively 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would be spread over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates may increase in the future if we incur debt to fund acquisitions or otherwise
