item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii  item of this report on form k 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including changes in estimates and judgments used in preparing our financial statements set forth under critical accounting policies and estimates and the factors set forth under certain risk factors relating to our business in this section 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the following accounting policies include a higher degree of judgment and or complexity and  thus  are considered to be critical accounting policies 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them 
inventory valuation we mark down our inventory for estimated unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory markdowns may be required  which could reduce our margins and operating results 
management records these inventory markdowns periodically based on the various assumptions  including customer demand and preferences 
our success is largely dependent upon management s ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand 
any failure to provide appropriate merchandise in quantities that mirror demand could increase future inventory write downs 
additionally  our inventories are valued using the retail method in north america and bijoux and average cost in uk and france 
fluctuations in demand for inventory affect the value of our inventory 
asset impairment we invest in property and equipment in connection with the opening and remodeling of stores 
we evaluate the recoverability of these assets periodically and record an impairment charge when we believe the cash flow may not be sufficient to recover the assets 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby 
table of contents possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million relating to fixed assets in our international segment due to those assets not being recoverable by estimated discounted cash flows 
goodwill impairment we continually evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives or recognition of an impairment loss of unamortized goodwill 
the conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment of unamortized goodwill include a significant  sustained negative trend in our operating results or cash flows  a decrease in demand for our products  a change in the competitive environment and other industry and economic factors 
we measure impairment of unamortized goodwill utilizing the discounted cash flow method 
the estimated discounted cash flows are then compared to our goodwill amounts 
if the unamortized balance of the goodwill exceeds the estimated discounted cash flows  the excess of the unamortized balance is written off 
future cash flows may not meet projected amounts  which could result in impairment 
intangible asset impairment we continually evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of the useful lives or recognition of an impairment loss for intangible assets 
future adverse changes in market and legal conditions  or poor operating results of underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the intangible asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company has concluded that certain intangible assets  comprised primarily of lease rights  qualify as indefinite life intangible assets 
fair market value of the lease rights were determined through the use of third party valuation 
in addition  we make investments through our international subsidiaries in intangible assets upon the opening and acquisition of many of our store locations in europe 
these other intangible assets which are subject to amortization are amortized over the useful lives of the respective leases  not to exceed years 
we evaluate the market value of these assets periodically and record the impairment charge when we believe the asset has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
we recorded impairment charges of approximately million in fiscal because the market value of certain lease rights included in our international segment were determined to be less than their carrying values 
accounting for leases we finance certain leasehold improvements and equipment used in our stores through transactions accounted for as non cancelable operating leases 
as a result  the rental expense for these leasehold improvements and equipment is recorded during the term of the lease contract in our consolidated financial statements  generally over four to seven years 
in the event that any of the real property leases where leasehold improvements or equipment is located that are subject to these non cancelable operating leases is terminated by us or our landlord prior to the scheduled expiration date of the real property lease  we will be required to accrue all future rent payments under these operating leases as a charge against our earnings in the year of termination 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the valuation allowance is determined based on estimates by management of future taxable income 
our estimates of future taxable income can be affected by a number of factors  including possible tax audits or general economic conditions or competitive pressures that could affect our future taxable income 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
recorded within our financial statements is a valuation allowance of million at february  due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize 
table of contents some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating loss carryforwards of million relating to the operations of our foreign subsidiaries  million of which have indefinite expiration  and 
million of which expire in fiscal although management believes that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles  actual results could differ from these estimates  and such differences could be material 
certain risk factors relating to our business the following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in our forward looking statements fluctuations in consumer preference and economic conditions affect the demand of our products our retail jewelry and fashion accessories business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences which are dictated in part by fashion and season 
in addition  certain economic conditions affect the level of consumer spending on merchandise that we offer  including  among others  business conditions  unemployment levels  interest rates  energy costs  taxation rates and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
consumer preference and economic conditions may differ or change from time to time in each market in which we operate and negatively affect our net sales and profitability 
purchases in advance of merchandise inventory  excessive markdowns  interruptions in distribution and material inventory shrinkage may negatively impact our profitability fluctuations in the demand for retail fashion accessories and apparel especially affect the inventory we own because we usually order our merchandise well in advance of the applicable season and sometimes before fashion trends are identified or evidenced by customer purchases 
in addition  the cyclical nature of the retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory  especially prior to peak selling seasons when we and other retailers generally build up inventory levels 
we purchase merchandise from our suppliers well in advance of the applicable selling season 
as a result  we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases 
we review our inventory aging in order to identify slow moving merchandise and use markdowns to clear merchandise 
markdowns may be used if inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference or lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently marked price 
such markdowns may have an adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent of the markdowns and amount of inventory affected 
distribution functions for all of our north american stores are handled from our distribution center in hoffman estates  illinois 
distribution functions for all of our stores in the united kingdom  france and ireland are handled from our distribution center in birmingham  united kingdom 
distribution facilities for all of our stores in switzerland  austria and germany are handled from our distribution centers in zurich  switzerland and vienna  austria 
any significant interruption in the operation of these distribution centers  due to natural disaster or otherwise  would have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have a loss prevention program in order to control inventory shrinkage  including surveillance systems  education of store personnel and monitoring of returns 
however  there can be no assurance that these safeguards will prevent or adequately limit inventory shrinkage 
any material inventory shrinkage would have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability 
a disruption of imports from our foreign suppliers may increase our costs and reduce our supply of merchandise we purchase merchandise from approximately  domestic and international suppliers 
in fiscal  approximately of all merchandise units purchased for our north american stores representing 
table of contents approximately of total cost were purchased domestically and the remaining of all merchandise units of cost were purchased from outside the united states 
in fiscal  approximately of our total merchandise units purchased for our north american stores representing of cost were from china  including hong kong  with the remainder coming from other foreign countries 
an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars has recently been reported in hong kong  singapore  and china 
any event  such as sars  political instability or the imposition of additional import restrictions that disrupt or otherwise adversely affect our imports from china or other foreign countries  would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations 
substantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in us dollars 
we cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our products currently are manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the us and other foreign governments  including the likelihood  type or effect of any such restrictions 
trade restrictions  including increased tariffs or quotas  embargoes  and customs restrictions  against merchandise could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we pursue a diversified global sourcing strategy that includes relationships with vendors in countries 
these sourcing operations may be adversely affected by political and financial instability resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries  significant fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  restrictions on the transfer of funds and or other trade disruptions 
fluctuations in same store net sales may affect the price of our stock our comparable same store net sales results have fluctuated in the past  on a monthly  quarterly and annual basis  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
a variety of factors affect our same store net sales results  including changes in fashion trends  changes in our merchandise mix  calendar shifts of holiday periods  actions by competitors  weather conditions and general economic and geopolitical conditions 
our comparable store net sales results for any particular fiscal month  fiscal quarter or fiscal year in the future may decrease 
as a result of these or other factors  our future comparable store net sales results are likely to have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock because investors may look to our same store net sales results to determine how we performed from period to period absent sales attributable to new stores 
store operations and expansion may affect our ability to increase net sales and operate profitably our continued success depends  in part  upon our ability to increase sales at existing store locations  to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis and to maintain good relationships with mall developers and operators 
because we are primarily a mall based retailer  our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to open new stores in desirable locations  including malls 
our ability to open new stores depends on a number of factors  including our ability to locate and obtain favorable store sites primarily in malls  negotiate acceptable lease terms  obtain adequate supplies of merchandise and hire and train qualified employees 
our ability to operate stores on a profitable basis depends on  among other factors  whether we have to take additional merchandise markdowns due to excessive inventory levels compared to sales trends  and whether we can reduce the number of under performing stores which have a higher level of fixed costs in comparison to net sales 
there can be no assurance that our growth will result in enhanced profitability or that we will achieve our targeted growth rates with respect to new store openings 
the failure to execute our international expansion or successfully integrate our international operations may impede our strategy of increasing net sales and adversely affect our operating results our international expansion is an integral part of our strategy to increase our net sales through store growth 
if our international expansion is not successful  our results of operations are likely to be adversely affected 
our ability to grow successfully in the continental european market depends in part on determining a sustainable formula to build customer loyalty and gain market share in the especially challenging retail environments of france and germany 
additionally  the integration of our operations in foreign countries presents certain challenges not necessarily presented in the integration of our north 
table of contents american operations  such as integration of information systems 
for example  we currently use the retail method to value our inventory in north america and bijoux  but use the average cost method for valuing our inventory in the uk and france 
the failure to expand and integrate our foreign operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and impede our strategy of increasing our net sales through expansion 
the useful life and value of our goodwill and intangible assets will continue to be reevaluated and could result in a write down of our goodwill or intangible assets in a future period as of february   intangible assets  which include goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets  totaled approximately of our total assets 
we acquire intangible assets when we purchase businesses or acquire lease rights 
at the time of or following each acquisition by us of intangible assets  we evaluate each acquisition and establish an appropriate useful life and carrying value for all intangible assets  including goodwill  identified based on the specific underlying facts and circumstances of the acquisition 
subsequent to such initial evaluation  we annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  reevaluate such facts and circumstances to determine if the related intangible assets  including goodwill  continue to be realizable and if the useful life continues to be appropriate 
as the underlying facts and circumstances subsequent to the date of acquisition can change  there can be no assurance that we will realize the value of such intangible assets  including goodwill 
we did not record any impairment charge during fiscal with respect to our unamortized balance of goodwill 
we recorded impairment charges of approximately million in fiscal because the market value of certain lease rights in our international segment were less than their carrying values 
any future determination  based on reevaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances that a significant impairment has occurred  would require the write off of the impaired portion of unamortized goodwill and intangible assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
changes in the anticipated seasonal business pattern could adversely effect our sales and profits and our quarterly results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors our business follows a seasonal pattern  peaking during the christmas  easter and back to school periods 
during fiscal  these periods accounted for approximately of our annual sales 
any decrease in sales or margins during these periods would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
seasonal fluctuations also affect inventory levels  because we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods 
we must carry a significant amount of inventory in anticipation of these selling periods 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the time of store openings  the amount of revenue contributed by new stores  the timing and level of mark downs  the timing of store closings  expansions and relocations  competitive factors  and general economic conditions 
our industry is highly competitive the specialty retail business is highly competitive 
we compete with national  international  and local department stores  specialty and discount store chains  independent retail stores and internet and catalog businesses that market similar lines of merchandise 
some competitors have more resources than us 
given the large number of companies in the retail industry  we cannot estimate the number of our competitors 
depth of selection in sizes  colors and styles of merchandise  merchandise procurement and pricing  ability to anticipate fashion trends and consumer preferences  inventory control  reputation  quality of merchandise  store design and location  brand recognition and customer service are all important factors in competing successfully in the retail industry 
our successful performance in recent years has increased the amount of imitation by other retailers 
such imitation has made and will continue to make the retail environment in which we operate more competitive 

table of contents in addition  our competitive position depends upon a number of factors relating to consumer spending  including future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment  business conditions  interest rates  energy costs and taxation 
a decline in consumer spending on fashion accessories and apparel could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability 
a decline in number of people who go to malls could reduce the number of our customers and reduce our net sales substantially all of our north american stores are located in regional shopping malls 
our sales are derived  in part  from the high volume of traffic in those malls 
we benefit from the ability of the mall s anchor tenants  generally movie theaters  large department stores and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic around our stores and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations for pre teens and teenagers 
sales volume and mall traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area  competition from non mall retailers  other malls where we do not have stores and the closing of anchor tenants in a particular mall 
in addition  a decline in the popularity of mall shopping among our target customers  pre teens and teenagers  and increased gasoline prices that may curtail customer visits to malls  could result in decreased sales that would have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
terrorist attacks have heightened security concerns and war or the threat of war could result in lower customer traffic in our stores in response to the terrorist attacks of september   security has been heightened in public areas 
any further threat of terrorist attacks or actual terrorist events  particularly in public areas  could lead to lower customer traffic in regional shopping malls 
in addition  local authorities or mall management could close regional shopping malls in response to any immediate security concern 
for example  on september   a substantial number of our stores were closed early due to closure of the malls in response to the terrorist attacks 
mall closures  lower customer traffic due to security concerns  increased gasoline prices that may curtail customer visits to malls  and war or the threat of war could result in decreased sales that would have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on key personnel our success and ability to properly manage our growth depends to a significant extent both upon the performance of our current executive and senior management team and our ability to attract  hire  motivate and retain additional qualified management personnel in the future 
since november  our chairman and chief executive officer has been on a medical leave of absence  and our vice chairmen have assumed the responsibilities of our chairman and chief executive officer 
we also have commenced a search for a chief operating officer of claire s stores  inc  our parent company  and are seeking to fill the vacancy of chief operating officer of europe 
our inability to recruit and retain such additional personnel  or our loss of the services of any of our executive officers  could have a material adverse impact on us 
litigation matters incidental to our business could be adversely determined against us and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect our assets and operations we are involved from time to time in litigation incidental to our business  including litigation instituted by persons injured upon premises under our control  litigation with present and former employees and proceedings to protect our trademark rights 
management believes that the outcome of current litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
however  management s assessment of current litigation could change in light of the discovery of facts not currently known by us or determinations by judges  juries or other finders of fact not in accordance with management s assessment of the outcome of our pending litigation 
we may also become involved with litigation for businesses that we have acquired or businesses that we have disposed of  and we may be required to pursue our indemnification rights  to the extent available  under agreements with third parties for liabilities  if any  that might be assessed against us for these claims 
potential claims may also be 
table of contents asserted against us by creditors of lux corp 
as a result of its recent bankruptcy filing 
these potential claims may include or relate to obligations under real estate leases guaranteed by us  obligations under equipment and leasehold improvement leases assigned by us to lux corp  and payments received by us under the stock purchase agreement 
see discontinued operations 
depending on the actual outcome of pending or future litigation  charges could be recorded in the future that may have an adverse effect on our operating results 
we carry general liability  comprehensive property damage  workers compensation and other insurance coverages that management considers adequate for the protection of our assets and operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that the coverage limits of such policies will be adequate to cover losses and expenses for claims brought or which may be brought against us 
a successful claim against us in excess of insurance coverages could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we retain certain self insurance risks for health benefits  workers compensation benefits and casualty insurance programs 
self insurance reserves are established based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred by not yet reported 
there can be no assurance that our actual claims will not exceed our estimates 
the price of our stock may fluctuate in the future the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not continue to fluctuate significantly 
future announcements or management discussions concerning us or our competitors  sales and profitability results  quarterly variations in operating results or comparable store net sales  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or changes in accounting policies  among other factors  could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years 
control by our chairman we have two classes of common stock  common stock and class a common stock 
the holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share  and the holders of our class a common stock are entitled to votes for each share 
as of march   mr 
rowland schaefer  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  owns or has voting power over approximately of our common stock and approximately of our class a common stock and  as a result  controls approximately of our outstanding voting power on a combined basis 
as a result  our chairman substantially influences shareholder action  including the election of our directors 
this influence of us by our chairman may make us less attractive as a target for a takeover proposal 
it may also make it more difficult to discourage a merger proposal or proxy contest for the removal of incumbent directors 
as a result  this may deprive the holders of our common stock of an opportunity they might otherwise have to sell their shares at a premium over the prevailing market price in connection with a merger or acquisition of us or with or by another company 
our wage expenses may increase as a result of increases in federal minimum wage laws recent changes to federal minimum wage laws have raised the mandatory minimum wage 
various states  including states where we operate our business  have enacted increases that are higher than the federal minimum wage 
statutory increases in federal and state minimum wages above our current wages could require corresponding increases in higher employee wage rates 
increases in wage rates that are not offset by corresponding increases in sales would adversely affect our results of operations 
we caution our investors that the risk factors described above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us 
further  management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements

nippon are accounted for under the equity method 
as a result  any losses incurred by nippon in excess of our investment and advances are not reflected in our income statement because the operations are not part of our consolidated group in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  the operating results of nippon are not included in the following analysis 
in addition  the assets and liabilities of nippon are not included in our consolidated balance sheets 
under the equity method  our original investment in nippon was recorded at cost and had been adjusted periodically to recognize our proportionate share of earnings or losses from nippon since the acquisition date 
as of february  and february   our investment in nippon was carried at zero on our consolidated balance sheet

matters affecting comparability effective february   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment 
sfas no 
does not require retroactive restatement for all periods presented  however  it does require the disclosure of prior year effects adjusted for the elimination of amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets

refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased by million  or  to billion in fiscal compared to million for the year ended february   which is referred to as fiscal this increase resulted primarily 
table of contents from same store sales increases of for the year 
during fiscal  our sales in north america increased  while our international sales increased on a same store sales basis 
the same store sales increase in north america was primarily a result of an increase in the average retail per transaction partially offset by fewer transactions per store 
cost of sales  occupancy and buying expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this decrease of was primarily the result of increased merchandise margins as we reduced promotional activity and markdowns during the year through managing inventories efficiently 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of higher operating costs  approximately million of additional compensation earned by our chairman in fiscal  approximately million of impairment charges in our international operations  and approximately million of additional store bonuses due to increased sales 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to approximately in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease was primarily caused by leverage on fixed costs 
it has been our objective to close a number of under performing or duplicative acquired afterthoughts stores 
as of february   afterthoughts stores had been closed or leases not renewed and stores had been opened  resulting in stores remaining within our north american operations 
we expect to not renew the leases for approximately stores in fiscal during fiscal  we continued to eliminate redundant field operations and review under performing stores 
depreciation and amortization decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to goodwill no longer being amortized in accordance with sfas no 
approximately million of goodwill was amortized in fiscal in addition  depreciation increased from our international divisions  partially offset by lower depreciation in north america 
interest expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease of million was primarily the result of lower interest rates and lower borrowings on our credit facility 
interest and other income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the net decrease was primarily the result of lower interest rates on our invested cash balances  partially offset by the inclusion of approximately million of fees received in consideration of performing certain administrative functions for the new owners of lux corp 
income taxes increased by million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of pre tax income from continuing operations  income taxes decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal was 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for the year ended february   which is referred to as fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from same store sales decreases of for the year 
during fiscal  our sales in north america decreased  while our international sales increased on a same store sales basis 
the same store sales decrease in north america was primarily a result of fewer transactions per store  partially offset by an increase in the average retail per transaction 
cost of sales  occupancy and buying expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase of was primarily the result of additional merchandise markdowns required due to excessive inventory levels compared to sales trends in north america 
these markdowns were recorded in the second quarter of 
table of contents fiscal these markdowns helped us reduce inventory levels to be in line with planned sales for future periods 
in addition  the decline in same store sales discussed above resulted in the lack of leverage on fixed occupancy costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was caused by inflationary cost increases  partially offset by cost savings achieved in store payroll by reducing hours worked to correspond with lower sales patterns 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to approximately in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase was primarily caused by lack of leverage on fixed costs 
it has been our objective to close a number of under performing or duplicative acquired afterthoughts stores 
as of february   afterthoughts stores had been closed or leases not renewed and stores had been opened resulting in stores remaining 
during fiscal  we continued to eliminate redundant field operations and review under performing stores 
as a result of our review  we recorded a million non cash charge to write off the assets whose carrying value had been impaired 
depreciation and amortization increased by  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increased depreciation from our international divisions  partially offset by lower depreciation in north america 
interest expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease of million was primarily the result of lower interest rates and lower borrowings on our credit facility

income taxes decreased by million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of pre tax income from continuing operations  income taxes increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate from continuing operations was affected by the tax benefits of losses in lux corp  being included in the loss from discontinued operations 
our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal was 
seasonality and quarterly results our business is seasonal by nature  with the christmas  easter and back to school periods historically accounting for the largest percentage of annual net sales 
in fiscal  the christmas  easter and back to school periods together accounted for approximately of our annual net sales 
see note of our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation inflation impacts several of our operating costs including  but not limited to cost of goods and supplies  occupancy costs and labor expenses 
we seek to mitigate these effects by passing along inflationary increases in costs through increased sales prices or by increasing sales 
discontinued operations in january  our board of directors authorized the disposition of lux corp  which represented our apparel segment 
in connection with the plan to dispose of lux corp  we recorded a loss on disposal of million  net of tax  in the consolidated financial statements as of february  on may   we sold the stock of lux corporation  d b a mr 
rags for i an initial payment of million  ii deferred payments to be paid aggregating million payable as of net sales during the first year and of net sales thereafter  and iii an amount to be paid equal to approximately of the gross sales of the inventory of mr 
rags as of the closing date 
through the date of disposition  the operations of lux corp 
were accounted for as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements 
the deferred payments aggregating million were not included in our estimate of loss on 
table of contents disposition as the timing and amount could not be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty of the financial condition of the acquired business 
in january  lux corp 
filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of california 
in april  lux corp 
advised the bankruptcy court that it intends to liquidate its assets 
as a result  no deferred payments have been made to us since the date of the bankruptcy filing  and there is no assurance that we will receive any future deferred payments 
during fiscal  we recorded approximately 
million  net of tax  loss on disposal of lux corp 
as of february   we remain as a guarantor on real estate leases for mr 
rags store locations with future rental payments of approximately million 
as of february   we also had a contingent liability as lessee under a master lease agreement on million of gross future lease payments on operating leases for equipment and leasehold improvements of lux corp 
that were assigned to lux corp 
at the time of the sale 
based on management s review of the financial performance of mr 
rags since the date of sale and  taking into consideration the bankruptcy filing by lux corp 
in january and the related impact on lux corp 
s ability to fulfill the commitments under these real estate and operating leases  we accrued a liability of million at february  we also entered into a service agreement with the new owner of lux corp 
in may under which we perform certain transition services for the benefit of mr 
rags  with no decision making authority 
the service agreement was for an initial period of one year  with two three month renewal options 
lux corp 
has exercised the first renewal option  so the service agreement is scheduled to terminate in august  unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of the service agreement 
as of february   we have received approximately million for these services and have included this amount in interest and other income within our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for fiscal in order to conform to the separate presentation of the net assets and operating results of lux corp 
as a discontinued operation  certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation 
liquidity and capital resources in connection with the acquisition of afterthoughts in december  we entered into a credit facility pursuant to which we financed million of the purchase price for afterthoughts 
the credit facility includes a million revolving line of credit which matures on december   and a million five year term loan  the first installment of which was paid on december   with future installments  thereafter  payable on a quarterly basis through december  the credit facility is prepayable without penalty and bears interest at a margin of basis points over the london interbank borrowing rate 
the margin is adjusted periodically based on our performance as it relates to certain financial covenants 
on february  approximately million was outstanding on this line of credit  while million was outstanding under the term loan 
also  on february   the borrowings under this credit facility were bearing interest at  and we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
we cannot re borrow amounts repaid under the term loan 
as a result  we have no future availability under the term loan 
we can re borrow amounts repaid under the revolving line of credit  subject to the terms of the credit facility 
as of february   we had million of availability under the revolving line of credit 
we also had million of issued letters of credit which are supported by and considered drawn against our line of credit 
we are required to maintain financial ratios under our credit facility 
required financial ratios include fixed charge coverage ratio  consolidated leverage ratio and current ratio 
the credit facility also contains other restrictive covenants which limit  among other things  our ability to make dividend distributions 
if these financial ratios and other restrictive covenants are not maintained  our bank will have the option to require immediate repayment of all amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
the most likely result would require us to either renegotiate certain terms of the credit agreement  obtain a waiver from the bank  or obtain a new credit agreement with another bank  which may contain different terms 
the company s non us subsidiaries have credit facilities totaling approximately million with banks 
the facilities are used for working capital requirements  letters of credit and various guarantees 
these credit facilities have been arranged in accordance with customary lending practices in their

at february   the borrowings totaled  bearing interest at rates at approximately 
we finance certain leasehold improvements and equipment used in our stores through transactions accounted for as non cancelable operating leases 
as a result  the rental expense for these leasehold improvements and equipment is recorded during the term of the lease contract in our consolidated financial statements  generally over four to seven years 
in the event that any of the real property leases where leasehold improvements or equipment is located that are subject to these non cancelable operating leases is terminated by us or our landlord prior to the scheduled expiration date of the real property lease  we will be required to accrue all future rent payments under these operating leases 
at february   we had  accrued related to future payment obligations on leasehold improvement leases for closed stores 
we are guarantor on approximately million of real estate leases of mr 
rags of which we have accrued million as a contingent liability 
see discontinued operations 
as of february   the company s future financial commitments under these arrangements are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations less than more than in millions total year years years years real estate obligations operating leases for equipment and leasehold improvements long term debt obligations letters of credit total we review the operating performance of our stores on an on going basis to determine which stores  if any  to expand  relocate or close 
we closed stores in fiscal and anticipate closing approximately stores in fiscal our operations have historically provided a positive cash flow which  together with our cash balances  provide adequate liquidity to meet our operational needs and debt obligations 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at the end of fiscal net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the primary sources of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  an increase in trade account payables and accrued expenses of million and an increase in income taxes payable  partially offset by an increase in inventories of million and an increase in prepaids and other assets of million 
our current ratio current assets over current liabilities was for fiscal and for fiscal at the end of fiscal  we increased our investment in inventories to million  or  from the fiscal balance of million 
our average store inventories vary throughout the year and increase in advance of the peak selling periods of christmas  easter and back to school 
during fiscal  
table of contents inventory turnover increased to times from times for fiscal the increase in inventories was due to carrying appropriate levels of inventory to meet planned sales for the spring season 
in addition  inventories on a per square foot basis increased 
net cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal was primarily a result of capital expenditures of million  the acquisition of intangible assets lease rights within our international segment of million offset by and the sale of short term investments 
during fiscal  we continued to expand and remodel our store base 
significant capital projects included the opening of new stores and the remodeling of stores 
in fiscal  capital expenditures and acquisition of intangible assets lease rights are expected to be approximately million and million  respectively  as we continue to invest in expanding and remodeling our store base and technology 
net cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to our payments on the credit facility of million and dividends paid of million  offset by million received from the exercise of stock options 
working capital at the end of fiscal was million compared to million at the end of fiscal the increase in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million  inventories of million and prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  offset by an increase in current liabilities 
we believe that we will be able to finance our capital expenditure plans for fiscal based on our consistent ability to generate cash flow from operations  significant cash balances and available funds under our credit facilities 
recent accounting pronouncements effective february   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas  we ceased amortizing its goodwill effective february  we recorded million of amortization during the year ended february  and would have recorded million of amortization during the year ended february  net income for the year ended february  would have been million or per diluted share without goodwill amortization expense during that period 
we had and million of unamortized goodwill at february  and february   respectively 
sfas required us  upon our adoption  to reassess the value of  and useful lives assigned to  intangible assets including goodwill to determine whether the value of one or more intangible assets is impaired 
the first step of this impairment test required us  within the first six months of fiscal  to determine the fair value of the reporting unit  as defined by sfas  and compare it to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit 
if this fair value exceeded the carrying value  no further analysis was required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value of the net assets  we were required to perform step two of the impairment test  which required us to allocate the implied fair value of the reporting unit to all underlying assets and liabilities  including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets  based on their fair value 
we performed a transitional goodwill impairment test as required and determined that no goodwill impairment existed at february  the company has concluded that certain intangible assets  comprised primarily of lease rights  qualify as indefinite life intangible assets under sfas fair market value of the lease rights were determined through the use of third party valuation 
in addition  the company makes investments through the international subsidiaries in intangible assets upon the opening and acquisition of many of our store locations in europe 
these intangible assets  which are subject to amortization  are amortized over the useful lines of the respective leases  not to exceed years 
the company evaluates the market value of these assets periodically and records the impairment charge when the company believes the asset has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
sfas also requires us to perform a goodwill and intangible asset impairment test on an annual basis 
any impairment charges resulting from the application of this test in the future would be immediately recorded as a charge to earnings in our statement of operations 
we recorded impairment charges of 
table of contents approximately million in fiscal because the market value during fiscal of certain lease rights included in our international segment were determined to be less than their carrying values 
this impairment charge is included within the financial statement caption selling  general  administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
on july   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
that standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
as a result  sfas no 
was not effective for our fiscal financial statements 
management has not determined the effect that sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement retains the requirements of sfas no 
to a recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its discounted cash flows and b measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
this statement requires that a long lived asset to be abandoned  exchanged for a similar productive asset  or distributed to owners in a spin off be considered held and used until it is disposed of 
this statement requires that the depreciable life of a long lived asset to be abandoned be revised and that an impairment loss be recognized at the date a long lived asset is exchanged for a similar productive asset or distributed to owners in a spin off if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale is used for all long lived assets  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
that accounting model measures a long lived asset classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and requires depreciation amortization to cease 
discontinued operations are no longer measured on a net realizable value basis  and future operating losses are no longer recognized before they occur 
this statement retains the basic provisions of accounting principles board opinion for the presentation of discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
a component of an entity that is classified as held for sale or that has been disposed of is presented as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component will be or have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component 
we adopted sfas on february  management has determined that the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
we recorded impairment charges of approximately million during the year ended february  related to fixed assets in our international segment due to those assets not being recoverable by estimated discounted cash flows 
this impairment charge is included within the financial statement caption selling  general  administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred compared to prior literature  which recognized a liability when the entity committed to an exit plan 
management believes that this statement will not have a material impact on our financial statements  however  the statement will result in a change in accounting policy associated with the recognition of liabilities in connection with future restructuring charges 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation 
table of contents undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   while the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual reports ending after december  we have determined that fin did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods for voluntary transition to sfas no 
s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation the fair value method 
sfas no 
also requires disclosure of the effects of an entity s accountings policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income loss and earnings loss per share in annual and interim financial statements 
we are required to follow the prescribed disclosure format and have provided the additional disclosures required by sfas no 
for the year ended february  see note and must also provide the disclosures in our quarterly reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning with the quarterly period ending may  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation defines a variable interest entity as a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the equity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
this interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
we would have to consolidate any of our variable interest entities that meet the above criteria as of july  the interpretation also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that we are not required to consolidate but in which we have a significant variable interest 
management is in the process of determining if our interests in unconsolidated entities qualify as variable interest entities and  if so  whether the assets  liabilities  non controlling interest  and results of activities are required to be included in our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currency denominated transactions and our investment in foreign subsidiaries 
we manage this exposure to market risk through our regular operating and financing activities  but currently do not use foreign currency purchased put options or foreign exchange forward contracts 
during fiscal  included in comprehensive income and stockholders equity is million reflecting the unrealized gain on foreign currency translation 
based on our average net currency positions in fiscal  the potential gain or loss due to a adverse change on foreign currency exchange rates could be significant to our operations 
interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is limited to our cash  cash equivalents and debt 
based on our average invested cash balances and outstanding debt during fiscal  a increase in the average effective interest rate in fiscal would not have materially impacted our annual net interest expense
