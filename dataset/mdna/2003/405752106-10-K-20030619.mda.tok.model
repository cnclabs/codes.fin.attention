item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended march   and and financial condition as of march  and the comparison of the results with were affected by the sale of discontinued operations and embezzlement recovery activities 
results of operations and related notes thereto have been adjusted for discontinued operations 
as a result of our discontinuation of our operational outsourcing business  we operate as a single business segment  whereby we provide high availability maintenance services  technology deployment and integration  and secure network solutions for commercial and government activities

services revenue includes monthly recurring fixed unit price contracts as well as time and material contracts 
amounts billed in advance of the services period are recorded as unearned revenue and recognized when earned 
the revenue and related expenses associated with product sales are recognized when the products are delivered and accepted by the customer 
for fiscal year revenues increased or million to million compared to in fiscal year revenues decreased million or to million compared to million in fiscal the change in revenues during both years was largely the result of a change in the sales mix of our business from a value added reseller to a services company 
during fiscal services revenue increased million  or  compared with fiscal and million  or  in fiscal as compared to this was offset by a continued decline in sales of product held for resale to million in fiscal from million in  a decrease  and a decrease of million or decrease compared to fiscal the decrease in product sales was principally the result of management s intentional de emphasis on this low margin line of business 
in fiscal year  we expect our services revenue to increase while our product sales revenue will continue to decline due to on going competition and a de emphasis of low margin product sales by the company 
the components of revenue for fiscal year  and were march  amounts in thousands revenue services product held for resale total revenue cost of services included within costs of services are direct costs  including fringe benefits  product and part costs  certain selling expenses and other costs 
the variable component of these costs is product and part cost 
product is broken into two categories parts and equipment to support our service base and product held for resale 
part cost is highly variable and is dependent on several factors 
on long term fixed unit price contracts  parts and peripherals are consumed on service calls 
for installation services and seat management services  product may consist of hardware  software  cabling and other materials that are a component of the service performed 
product held for resale consists of hardware and software 
on long term fixed unit price contracts part costs vary depending upon the call volume received from customers during the period 
higher call volume typically would result in higher cost of services 
a large part of our service costs are support costs and expenses that include direct labor and infrastructure costs to support our service offerings 
as we continue to expand our source offerings  we anticipate that the direct costs to support these service offerings will continue to increase in fiscal year there was a decrease in the cost of product held for resale during fiscal year compared to fiscal year and an additional decrease in cost of product held for resale in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to our de emphasis on product sales 
the services and support component of cost of services increased million or during fiscal year compared to and or million compared to the increase in service costs in both periods was attributable to the expansion of our company services to seven days a week hours a day 
during the fiscal year ended march   indirect cost decreased  or thousand  compared to march  the decrease was largely due to overall cost containment  including reducing occupancy cost  consolidation of administrative functions  reduced staffing and higher utilization of our workforce 
during the fiscal year ended march  indirect costs decreased million compared to the decrease in was do to a reduction in charges for obsolete inventory from and cost containment measures under taken during the year 
cost of services consists of the following components march  amounts in thousands service product held for resale total direct cost indirect costs selling expense cost of services as a result of the favorable changes in the mix of our business and continued emphasis on higher margin long term services contracts  we have experienced improvement in our gross margin of thousand  or  in fiscal year from million in fiscal year additionally  gross margin grew million from million in fiscal year  an improvement of 
marketing during the fiscal year ended march   we created a company wide marketing group 
the marketing group was created to facilitate a nationwide sales campaign 
in doing so  we refined and redirected our sales force and strategy  focusing our direct sales efforts on specific targeted accounts and growing our base of strategic partners to strengthen our indirect sales channel which has resulted in growth in higher margin service revenues 
expense for the fiscal year ended march  was thousand compared to thousand in  a increase 
during the fiscal year ended march  there was no marketing expense 
general and administration general and administrative expense decreased thousand  or  in fiscal year compared to this decrease was a result from cost control efforts  including employment actions such as postponing salary increases  and in certain cases  reducing wage rates for administrative staff 
during fiscal year  general and administrative cost increased thousand  or  compared to the increase in general and administrative cost in fiscal year was attributable to increased professional fees  consulting services  and increases in business insurance due to general market conditions 
various factors  such as changes in insurance markets  related costs associated with new securities and exchange commission rules and the american stock exchange regulations compliance mandates is expected to increase general and administrative expenses and have a negative impact on fiscal year depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was thousand  thousand and thousand for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
for the year ended march   the decrease in depreciation and amortization was due to the implementation of statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets which required that goodwill no longer be amortized against earnings  but instead be reviewed periodically for impairment 
in addition  there were reductions in depreciation expense due to an increase in fully depreciated assets and a decrease in capital expenditures for fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
we continue to focus the majority of our capital spending on technology enhancements that will increase operating efficiencies 
operating income loss halifax s operating income increased thousand  or  to million in fiscal year compared to thousand in fiscal and million in fiscal year the principal reasons for the improved performance over the three years were changes in the revenue mix to higher margin long term services contracts from lower margin sales of product  the positive effort of on going cost containment measures  and as a result  lower operating costs 
interest expense interest expense increased from thousand to thousand during fiscal year due to slightly higher monthly borrowing activities compared to fiscal year during fiscal year compared to  interest expense decreased from thousand  or  in fiscal year to thousand in fiscal year the primary reason for the lower expense was the significant reduction in interest rates during fiscal year embezzlement recovery during the fiscal year ended march  halifax reported embezzlement recoveries of million 
income taxes we recorded provisions from income taxes of thousand  thousand and thousand for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
our company has a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million which expires in fiscal year and is available to substantially reduce our potential income tax for future periods 
discontinued operations we sold our operational outsourcing business during fiscal year and accordingly  recorded income from discontinued operations and a gain on the sale of the discontinued operations of thousand and million  respectively 
net earnings net earnings increased from thousand in fiscal year to thousand in fiscal year  or 
earnings per share were  basic and diluted  for the year end march  compared to  basic and diluted  for the fiscal year ended march  net earnings for fiscal year ended march  was million or 
per share  basic and diluted 
the net income for fiscal year was generated by embezzlement recoveries and the sale of the operational outsourcing business 
excluding these items from  we would have reported a significant loss during liquidity and capital resources our future operating results may be affected by a number of factors including uncertainties relative to national economic conditions and terrorism  especially as they affect interest rates  industry factors and our ability to successfully increase our sales of services and effectively manage expenses 
we must continue to effectively manage expenses in relation to revenues by directing new business development towards markets that complement or improve our existing service lines 
management must also continue to emphasize operating efficiencies through cost containment strategies  reengineering efforts and improved service delivery techniques 
halifax serves its customer base by providing high availability enterprise maintenance services  consulting  integration  networking  and installation services 
this industry has been characterized by rapid technological advances that have resulted in frequent introductions of new products  product enhancements and aggressive pricing practices  which also impacts pricing of service activities 
our operating results could be adversely affected by industry wide pricing pressures  the ability to recruit  train and retain personnel integral to our operations and the presence of competitors with adversely impacted should our company be unable to achieve the revenue growth necessary to provide profitable operating margins in various operations 
our plan for growth includes intensified marketing efforts  an expanding national sales program  strategic alliances and  where appropriate  acquisitions that expand market share 
there can be no assurances these efforts will be successful  or if successful  will be on terms advantageous to us 
liquidity and capital resources amounts in thousands cash balance at march working capital at march net cash provided by used in operations before impact of embezzlement net cash recovered related to embezzlement net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investment activities net cash used in provided by financing activities at march   we had working capital of million and a current ratio of 
the increase in working capital was attributable to net earnings 
a summary of future minimum lease payments is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures in fiscal year were thousand and fiscal year were thousand 
we anticipate fiscal year technology requirements to result in greater capital expenditures totaling approximately thousand 
our company continues to sublease a portion of its headquarters building generating approximately thousand annually 
on march   we entered into a new revolving credit agreement with an million maximum 
during the year  the loan was extended and now has a maturity date of july  and bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
advances under the revolving credit agreement are collateralized by a first priority security interest in all of our assets as defined in the agreement 
amounts available under the revolving credit agreement are determined by applying stated percentages to the eligible receivables 
the agreement contains a subjective acceleration clause whereby the lender may demand payment on the agreement under certain circumstances as defined in the agreement 
the company is in compliance with the covenant of its credit and security agreement at march  the agreement has one financial covenant that requires the stockholders deficit not increase above million 
at march   our stockholders deficit was thousand 
our recent results have shown increased profitability on contracts due to a combination of efficiencies gained in the change of mix in our business from the resale of product to more services  as well as reduced cost achieved through containment measures including reducing occupancy cost  consolidation of administrative functions  reduced staffing and higher utilization of our workforce 
although we expect to remain in compliance with the financial covenant  no assurance can be given 
should stockholders deficit rise above million  we would attempt to work with the bank to arrive at a mutually acceptable resolution 
if our customer base were to remain constant  we expect to have approximately million available on our revolving credit agreement through october  if we were to obtain a significant new contract or contract modifications  our borrowing availability may be less as we are generally required to invest significant initial startup funds that will later be billed to customers 
on december   we entered into a revolving credit agreement with an million maximum 
amounts available under this agreement are determined by applying stated percentages to our company s eligible and unbilled receivables 
the outstanding amount of the loan was paid in full and was replaced by a new revolving credit agreement dated march  the new revolving credit agreement prohibits the payment of dividends or distributions as well as limits the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt 
interest expense on subordinated debt accrues on a current basis 
our subordinated debt agreements with research industries  incorporated  an affiliate  totaled million at march  and principal repayment and interest payable on the subordinated debt agreements have been extended to july  during the fiscal year ended march   the bank approved  and we made payments of thousand for interest due and on january   we made a payment of thousand to research industries for interest due 
at march  and  interest payable to research industries was thousand and thousand  respectively 
our company believes that funds generated from operations  bank borrowings  and investing activities should be sufficient to meet its current operating cash requirements through july   although there can be no assurances that all the aforementioned sources of cash can be realized 
the following are our contractual obligations associated with lease commitments  debt obligations and consulting commitments 
amounts in thousands year ended bank line of subordinated vehicle consulting operating march  credit debt loans commitment leases total thereafter total an affiliate see note to the consolidated financial statements  holds million face amount of the company s convertible subordinated debenture dated january  and thousand  thousand  thousand  and thousand face amount of the company s subordinated notes dated october   october   november  and november   respectively 
these notes are each subordinate to the bank revolving credit agreement and cannot be paid without the consent of its bank 
the company has three notes with an automobile manufacturer 
two notes have terms of months and one note has a term of months 
the balances and respective interest rates on the notes at march  were thousand  thousand  and thousand with interest rates of  and  respectively 
the company has a consulting advisory service commitment with a former chief executive officer of the company 
from april  through march   the company is to pay the former chief executive officer thousand per year for consulting services 
application of critical accounting policies halifax corporation s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the methods  estimates  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as policies that involve critical accounting estimates that require i management to make assumptions that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and ii different estimates that could have been reasonably used for the current period  or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or in results of operations 
based on this definition  our most critical policies include inventory valuation reserve and allowances for doubtful accounts  which impact cost of sales and gross margin  and the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  which impact write offs of goodwill and intangibles  provision for loss contracts  income taxes and legal contingencies 
we discuss these policies further below  as well as the estimates and management s judgments involved 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as policies for revenue recognition  including unbilled accounts receivable and deferred revenue  as well as policies governing the estimate of the useful life of our property and equipment 
we believe these policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operation for a given period 
revenue recognition we recognize service revenue based on contracted fees earned  net of credits and adjustments  as the service is performed 
revenue from long term fixed unit price contracts is recognized monthly as service is performed based upon the number of units covered and the level of service requested 
the pricing in these contracts is fixed as to the unit price but varies based upon the number of units covered and service level requested 
revenue from time and material professional service contracts is recognized as services are delivered 
certain seat management contracts include the delivery and installation of new equipment combined with multi year service agreements 
revenue related to the delivery and installation of equipment under these and certain other contracts is recognized upon the completion of both the delivery and installation 
invoices billed in advance are recognized as revenue when earned 
revenues are a function of the mix of long term services contracts and time and material professional services 
revenues from time and material professional services are difficult to forecast because of wide fluctuations in demand 
the long term contracts are more predictable and  as a result  the revenue stream is less difficult to forecast 
the gross margins on long term contracts vary inversely with the call volume received from customers in any one reporting period 
our expectation is that we will see continued growth in long term contracts  which historically have had higher gross margins  and continued downward pressure on hardware and software margins 
provision for loss contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which they become determinable 
historically  we have had few loss contracts 
at march   we had no loss contracts 
our gross margin should benefit from revenue growth and continued cost containment strategies implemented 
our gross margin varies based on the level of long term professional services compared to product volume  including the mix of types of product being sold 
inventory provisions our policy for valuation of inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand based on prior usage to support our contracts and anticipated future demand 
if the demand is less than anticipated  we would be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margins 
for the last three years  our inventory reserve has ranged from to of inventory 
the annual charge for fiscal year is projected to be approximately thousand or to of inventory 
a change in estimate would have an impact on earnings of approximately thousand 
accounts receivables we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances and our historical write off experience  net of recoveries 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because changes in it can significantly affect net income and treatment of the allowance requires us to anticipate the economic viability of our customers and requires a degree of judgment 
our estimate of bad debt expense is approximately of revenue 
a change in the estimate by would have an impact on earnings of approximately thousand 
over the past three years bad debts expense represented approximately to of revenue 
the company routinely transfers receivables to a third party in connection with equipment leased to end users 
the credit risk passes to the third party at the point of sale of the receivables 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  transfers were accounted for as sales  and as a result  the related receivables have been excluded from the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the amount paid to the company for the receivables by the transferee is approximately equal to the company s carrying value and therefore the gain recognized is not material 
the end user remits its monthly payments directly to an escrow account held by a third party from which payments are made to the transferee and the company  for various services provided to the end users 
the company provides limited monthly servicing whereby the company invoices the end user on behalf of the transferee 
goodwill and other acquired intangibles we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations and no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly we no longer amortize goodwill  but will continue to amortize other acquisition related costs 
during fiscal year  amortization of acquisition related intangibles was thousand  down from thousand of amortized goodwill and acquisition related intangibles and costs in fiscal year we assign useful lives for long lived assets based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and our intended use for those assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate these carrying values may not be recoverable 
any changes in these asset lives would be reported in our statement of operations as soon as any change in estimate is determined 
there have been no material changes in asset lives during the three fiscal years 
our impairment review is based on a market approach that uses valuation ratios for publicly traded companies based on the ratio of market price of their stock and or invested capital to various financial parameters 
halifax has been designated as a single reporting unit for financial reporting purposes 
under this method  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value inclusive of goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment and no further analysis is necessary 
if our revenue and cost forecasts are not achieved  we fail to have continued profitability and market acceptance  or the market conditions in the stock market cause the valuation to decline  we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 
plant property and equipment we estimate the useful lives of property and equipment in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the majority of our equipment is depreciated over four to seven years 
the estimated useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization in future periods 
we review for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets 
in assessing impairments  we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  utilizing cash flows which take into account management s estimates of future operations 
income taxes and valuation allowance deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for income tax purposes 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that  if changed  would result in either an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income  the character of income needed to realize future tax benefits  historical financial results adjusted for non recurring items and all other available evidence 
presently  we record a valuation allowance of of the deferred tax asset based on the weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains an analysis of our deferred tax assets 
management will continue to monitor its historical results when adjusted for non recurring items  estimates of future profitability and all other evidence to assess the realizably of its net deferred tax assets based on evolving business conditions 
should management determine it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized  this would have a significant effect on net income 
recent pronouncements in june  the fasb issued two new statements sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
effective april   the company adopted sfas no 
that requires business combinations entered into after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
specifically identifiable intangible assets  other than goodwill  are to be amortized over their estimated useful economic life 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized  but should be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and applies to goodwill and other intangible assets  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
effective april   the company adopted sfas no 
and in connection with its adoption  discontinued the amortization of goodwill and reviewed the estimated useful lives of previously recorded identifiable intangible assets 
the company follows the two step process prescribed in sfas to test its goodwill for impairment 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
under the guidelines of sfas no 
 the company is required to perform an impairment test at least on an annual basis 
the company performed its initial goodwill impairment test as of april  and another impairment test as of march  based on the company s implied fair value  there was no indication of goodwill impairment 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
this standard requires that obligations that are legally enforceable and unavoidable  and are associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets  be recorded as liabilities when those obligations are incurred  with the amount of the liability initially measured at fair value 
the offset to the initial asset retirement obligation is an increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  this liability is accreted to its future value and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not believe this adoption of sfas no 
will have any material impact upon the company s financial statements

any gain or loss on extinguishments of debt classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods that does not meet the criteria in apb no 
must be reclassified 
these provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  additionally  sfas no 
requires sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions 
these lease provisions are effective for transactions occurring after may  the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
during the three months ended june  at march   and  the company did not record any after tax extraordinary gains on the early extinguishment of debt 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard  accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas no

this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier application encouraged 
previously issued financial statements will not be restated 
the provisions of eitf shall continue to apply for exit plans initiated prior to the adoption of sfas no 
accordingly  the initial adoption of sfas no 
will not have an effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
liabilities associated with future exit and disposal activities will not be recognized until actually incurred 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no

this statement is effective for fiscal years ending after december  currently  the company applies the disclosure only provision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and therefore does not expense stock options grants 
the disclosure only method includes the additional disclosures in compliance with the provisions of sfas no 
the adoption of the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
will not have an impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the required disclosure under this standard 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
some of the provisions of this statement are consistent with the current definition of liabilities in fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements 
the remaining provision of this statement are consistent with the board s proposal to revise that definition to encompass certain obligations that a reporting entity can or must settle by issuing its own equity shares  depending on the nature of this relationship established between the holder and the issuer 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities

in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that an entity issuing a guarantee including those embedded in a purchase or sales agreement must recognize  at the inception of the guarantee  a liability equal to the fair value of the guarantee 
the recording of this liability is not dependent on the probability that the payments will be required 
the offset to the liability will depend on the circumstances under which the guarantee was issued  but could include cash accounts receivable if it is a standalone transaction  net proceeds in a sales transaction  or expense if no compensation is received 
fin also requires detailed information about each guarantee or group of guarantee even if the likelihood of making a payment is remote 
the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for financial statements of periods ending after december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the disclosures required under this interpretation 
the recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  fin could have an impact on the future results of the company depending on guarantees issued  however  at this time we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation on no 
consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
fin requires the primary beneficiary to consolidate a variable interest entity vie if it has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
fin applies immediately to vies created after january   and to vies in which the entity obtains an interest after that date 
for vies acquired before february   the effective date for the company is april  the company is currently in the process of determining the impact of this statement on its results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
our other results of operations and other forward looking statements contained herein involve a number of risks and uncertainties  in particular  plans to cultivate new business  the ability to expand our footprint  revenues  pricing  gross margins and costs  capital spending  depreciation and amortization and potential future impairment of goodwill 
in addition to the factors discussed above  other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially included but are not limited to the following business and economic conditions in the areas we serve  possible disruption in commercial activities related to terrorist activities  reduced end user purchases relative to expectations  pricing pressures and excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory values 
we believe that we have the enterprise maintenance solutions offerings  facilities  personnel and competitive resources for continued business success 
however  future revenues  costs  margins and profits are influenced by a number of factors  including those discussed above  all of which are difficult to forecast 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of bank debt to finance its business 
the floating interest debt exposes us to interest rate risk  with the primary interest rate exposure resulting from changes in the prime rate 
it is assumed in the table below that the prime rate will remain constant in the future 
adverse changes in the interest rates or our inability to refinance our long term obligations may have a material negative impact on our operations 
the definitive extent of our interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
we do not believe such risk is material 
we do not customarily use derivative instruments to adjust our interest rate risk profile 
the information below summarizes halifax s sensitivity to market risks as of march  the table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by year of maturity of our funded debt
