item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview were outstanding for all periods prior to the combination  effective march  ebitda represents income loss before interest expense  income taxes  depletion  depreciation and amortization 
our management believes that ebitda may provide additional information about our ability to meet our future requirements for debt service  capital expenditures and working capital 
ebitda is a financial measure commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as a measure of a company s profitability or liquidity 
because ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  this measure may vary among companies 
the ebitda data presented above may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  effective january   we changed our method of accounting for derivative instruments 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a review of our financial position and results of operations for the periods indicated 
our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data and the related notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general overview we were organized as a delaware corporation in august in connection with our initial public offering the offering and the related combination of certain entities that held interests in the edge joint venture ii the joint venture and certain other oil and natural gas properties  herein referred to as the combination 
in a series of combination transactions  we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock and received in exchange of the ownership interests in the joint venture and certain other oil and natural gas properties 
in march  and contemporaneously with the combination  we completed the offering of  shares of our common stock generating proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses 
we have evolved over time from a prospect generation organization focused solely on high risk  high reward exploration to a team driven organization focused on a balanced program of exploration  exploitation  development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties 
following a top level management change in late  a more disciplined style of business planning and management was integrated into our technology driven drilling activities 
we believe these changes in our strategy and business discipline will result in continued growth in reserves  production and financial strength 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the accompanying financial statements 
changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
key estimates used by management include revenue and expense accruals  environmental costs  depreciation and amortization  asset impairment and fair values of assets acquired 
significant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize oil and natural gas revenue from our interests in producing wells as oil and natural gas is produced and sold from those wells 
oil and natural gas sold by us is not significantly different from our share of production 
oil and natural gas properties investments in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
all costs associated with the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized within a cost center 
our oil and natural gas properties are located within the united states of america that constitutes one cost center 
in accordance with the full cost method of accounting  we capitalized a portion of interest expense on borrowed funds 
employee related costs that are directly attributable to exploration and development activities are also capitalized 
these costs are considered to be direct costs based on the nature of their function as it relates to the exploration and development function 
oil and natural gas properties are amortized using the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserve quantities 
investments in unproved properties are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the prospects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
unevaluated properties are evaluated periodically for impairment on a property by property basis 
if the results of an assessment indicated that an unproved property is impaired  the amount of impairment is added to the proved oil and natural gas property costs to be amortized 
the amortizable base includes estimated future development costs and  where significant  dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs 
in addition  the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties are subject to a ceiling test  whereby to the extent that such capitalized costs subject to amortization in the full cost pool net of depletion  depreciation and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate of estimated future net after tax cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  such excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  an impairment of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties is assessed on a quarterly basis in conjunction with our quarterly filings with the securities and exchange commission 
no adjustment related to the ceiling test was required during the years ended december    or sales of proved and unproved properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
abandonment of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalize costs with no loss recognized 
oil and natural gas reserves there are uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserve quantities  projecting future production rates and projecting the timing of future development expenditures 
in addition  reserve estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than those of properties with a production history 
accordingly  the reserve estimates of new discoveries are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  condensate and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at the end of the respective years 
proved developed reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered through existing equipment and operating methods 
derivatives and hedging activities due to the instability of oil and natural gas prices  we have entered into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps  collars and floors for a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure from price fluctuations 
while the use of these arrangements limits the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it also limits the downside risk of adverse price movements 
our hedging arrangements typically apply to only a portion of our production  providing only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices 
we account for these transactions as hedging activities and  accordingly  realized gains and losses are included in oil and natural gas revenue during the period the hedged production occurs 
we formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged transactions 
in the event it is determined that the use of a particular derivative may not be or has ceased to be effective in pursuing a hedging strategy  hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively 
our revenue  profitability and future rate of growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  and the carrying value of our properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
these prices are dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
a substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and access to capital  as well as the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we may economically produce

we are also subject to reporting requirements of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation that requires a non cash charge to deferred compensation expense if the market price of our common stock at the end of a reporting period is greater than the exercise price of certain stock options

results for were favorably impacted by the recognition in the second quarter of of revenue associated with underaccruals in prior periods 
this adjustment resulted in mmcfe of additional production and  additional revenue 
natural gas revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for significantly lower realized prices coupled with a decline in production for the year were slightly offset by a lower realized hedge loss 
the average natural gas sales price for production in was per mcf  exclusive of hedging activity  compared to per mcf for  exclusive of hedging activity 
this decrease in average price received resulted in decreased revenue of approximately million based on current year production 
included within natural gas revenue for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively  representing losses from hedging activity 
these losses decreased the effective natural gas sales price by per mcf and per mcf  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   natural gas production decreased from mcf d in to mcf d in due primarily to natural declines in production at our austin field and o connor ranch properties  partially offset by increased production from new wells drilled in late and in this decrease in production compared to the prior year resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately million based on comparable period prices 
revenue from the sale of oil and condensate totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of from the prior year total of million 
the average realized price for oil and condensate for the year ended december  was per barrel compared to per barrel in lower average prices for the year resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately  based on current year production 
production volumes for oil and condensate increased to bbls d for the year ended december  compared to bbls d for the same prior year period 
the increase in oil and condensate production resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately  based on comparable period average prices 
revenue from the sale of ngls totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of from the total of million 
production volumes for ngls increased  from bbls d for the year ended december  to bbls d for the year ended december  the increase in ngl production increased revenue by million based on comparable period average prices 
this increase in production was largely due to increased liquids processing stemming from gato creek field webb county  texas  an acquisition made in late lower average realized prices for the year ended december  resulted in a decrease in revenue of million based on current year production 
the average realized price for ngls for the year ended december  was per barrel compared to per barrel for the same period in costs and operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million in the same period of  a decrease of 
current year results were impacted by lower well control insurance and salt water disposal costs  partially offset by higher treating costs incurred in compared to the prior year 
operating expenses averaged per mcfe for the year ended december  compared to per mcfe for the prior year period 
severance and ad valorem taxes for the year ended december  decreased from million in  to million in severance tax expense for was lower than the prior year period as a result of lower revenue as well as severance tax exemption credits on certain properties 
for the year ended december   severance tax expense was approximately of total revenue compared to of total revenue for the comparable period 
ad valorem costs  however  increased from approximately  in to over  in due primarily to additional costs on the ibarra and la jollo parr properties as well as the gato creek properties which were acquired at year end on an equivalent basis  severance and ad valorem taxes averaged per mcfe and per mcfe for the years ended december  and  respectively 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense dd a for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  full cost depletion on our oil and natural gas properties totaled million for compared to million in depletion expense on a unit of production basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe  higher than the rate of per mcfe 
the higher depletion rate per mcfe resulted in an increase in depletion expense of million 
for the year ended december   lower oil and natural gas production compared to the prior year period resulted in a decrease in depletion expense of million 
the increase in the depletion rate was primarily due to a higher amortizable base in compared to the prior year 
in december  we recorded costs of million related to the settlement of our litigation with bnp 
general and administrative expenses g a for the year ended december   excluding the deferred compensation expense discussed below  totaled million  a decrease from the total of million  due primarily to bad debt expense of  reserved in in addition  salaries and benefits were seven percent lower than costs 
offsetting these lower costs were higher professional service fees primarily legal costs and audit fees  higher officers and directors insurance costs and higher franchise taxes for compared to for the years ended december  and  overhead reimbursement fees reduced g a costs by  and  respectively 
g a on a unit of production basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to per mcfe for the comparable period 
we believe that lower lease costs for our new headquarters will have a positive impact on g a in see part i office and equipment 
deferred compensation cost reported in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation was a charge of  for the year ended december  compared to a credit of  in the comparable prior year period 
fin requires  among other things  a non cash charge to compensation expense if the price of our common stock on the last trading day of a reporting period is greater than the exercise price of certain options 
fin could also result in a credit to compensation expense to the extent that the trading price declines from the trading price as of the end of the prior period  but not below the exercise price of the options 
we adjust deferred compensation expense upward or downward on a monthly basis based on the trading price at the end of each such period as necessary to comply with fin we are required to report under this rule as a result of non qualified stock options granted to employees and directors in prior years and re priced in may of  as well as certain options newly issued in conjunction with the repricing

capitalized interest for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  in the prior year 
also included in interest expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  representing amortization of deferred loan costs associated with a new credit facility 
interest income totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the decrease in interest income is due primarily to the overall decrease in funds invested in overnight money market funds 
an income tax provision was recorded for the year ended december  of  as of december   approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards have been accumulated that begin to expire in for the year ended december   an income tax benefit of  was recorded as a result of reversing a valuation reserve 
currently  we do not anticipate a federal tax liability or making federal tax payments in for the year ended december   the company had net income of million  or basic earnings per share  as compared to net income of million  or basic earnings per share  in weighted average shares outstanding increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million in the comparable period 
the increase was due primarily to options exercised and vesting of restricted stock during year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue and production oil and natural gas revenue increased from million in to million in for  natural gas production comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue  oil and condensate comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue  and ngl s comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue

natural gas revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for due primarily to increased production and the favorable impact of higher natural gas prices 
for the year ended december   natural gas production increased from mcf d in to mcf d in resulting in an increase in revenue of approximately million based on comparable period prices 
the average natural gas sales price for production in was per mcf  exclusive of hedging activity  compared to per mcf for  exclusive of hedging activity 
this increase in average price received resulted in increased revenue of approximately million based on current year production 
included within natural gas revenue for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively  representing losses from hedging activity 
these losses decreased the effective natural gas sales price by per mcf and per mcf  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue from the sale of oil and condensate totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of from the prior year total of million 
the year ended december  included net losses from oil hedge activity of  no oil hedges were in place for production volumes for oil and condensate increased to bbls d for the year ended december  compared to bbls d for the same prior year period 
the increase in oil and condensate production caused an increase in revenue of approximately  based on comparable period average prices before hedges 
the average price received for oil and condensate for the year ended december  was per barrel compared to per barrel  excluding the impact of net oil hedge losses of per barrel  in lower average prices for the year resulted in a decrease in revenue of  based on current year production 
revenue from the sale of ngls totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of from the total of million 
production volumes for ngls for the year ended december  decreased  from bbls d to bbls d  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in ngl production decreased revenue by  based on comparable period average prices 
this decrease in production was largely due to high natural gas prices decreasing the economic value of ngl s and a resulting decision by management not to process our gas during several months of favorable pricing for the year ended december  resulted in an increase in revenue of  based on current year production 
the average realized price for ngls for the year ended december  was per barrel compared to per barrel for the same period in production of oil and natural gas was significantly impacted by our drilling results in the second half of and in we successfully drilled and completed gross net wells in the year ended december  that added additional production and revenue for gas production increases were due primarily to the drilling of  and strong performance from  the o connor ranch wells  the ibarra and la jolla parr wells on our la jolla prospect  the mire well on our horeb prospect and the robertson well on our duson frio prospect 
partially offsetting the favorable results of drilling were production declines on our older wells  primarily the margo and wells 
costs and operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million in the same period of  an increase of 
current year results were impacted by the increased number of wells operating in compared to the prior year as well as higher treating costs at the austin facility for a portion of  higher salt water disposal costs on our older wells  and higher well control insurance costs incurred in compared to the prior year 
operating expenses averaged per mcfe for the year ended december  compared to per mcfe for the prior year period 
the increase in operating expenses on a mcfe basis was due to the factors resulting in an overall increase in operating expenses described previously 
severance and ad valorem taxes for the year ended december  increased from million in  to million in  due to higher severance taxes paid on the increased revenue  primarily in the first quarter of on an equivalent basis  severance and ad valorem taxes were per mcfe and per mcfe for the years ended december  and  respectively 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense dd a for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  full cost dd a on our oil and natural gas properties totaled million for compared to million in depletion expense on a unit of production basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe  higher than the rate of per mcfe 
the higher depletion rate per mcfe resulted in an increase in depletion expense of million 
for the year ended december   higher oil and natural gas production compared to the prior year period resulted in an increase in depletion expense of million 
the increase in the depletion rate was primarily due to a higher amortizable base in compared to the prior year 
in december  we recorded costs of million related to the settlement of our litigation with bnp 
general and administrative expenses g a for the year ended december   excluding the deferred compensation expense discussed below  totaled million  a increase from the total of million 
the increase in costs was due primarily to bad debt expense of  reserved in  of which related to purchases by an enron affiliate  costs of  to purchase options from a former employee  higher salaries and related benefits  and higher legal and audit fees 
for the years ended december  and  overhead reimbursement fees of approximately  and  respectively  reduced g a costs

also included in interest expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  representing amortization of deferred loan costs associated with a new credit facility 
capitalized interest for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  in the prior year 
the reduction in capitalized interest resulted from lower interest costs incurred during the year ended december  compared to the same prior year period 
although gross interest expense has decreased compared to the prior year  the effect of less interest being capitalized to oil and natural gas properties has resulted in higher net interest costs reported in our results of operations 
interest income totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the increase in interest income is due to the overall increase in funds invested in overnight money market funds 
other income expense for the year ended december  also included a loss on the sale of our investment in frontera of  or per share 
an income tax benefit was recorded for the year ended december  of  as of december   approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards have been accumulated that begin to expire in based on our year end projections  we determined that we would fully realize our recorded tax assets 
accordingly   in associated valuation reserves was reversed in future financial statement income will necessitate income tax provisions at our effective rate 
for the year ended december   no tax expense or benefit was recorded because an allowance was provided to offset the tax benefits of certain tax assets 
for the year ended december   the company had net income of million  or basic earnings per share  as compared to net income of million  or basic earnings per share  in weighted average shares outstanding increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million in the comparable period 
the increase was due primarily to options exercised and vesting of restricted stock during liquidity and capital resources in march  we completed the offering of  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share 
the offering provided us with proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses 
we used approximately million to repay our long term outstanding indebtedness incurred under our revolving credit facility in place at the time  subordinated loans and equipment loans 
the remaining proceeds from the offering  together with cash flows from operations  were used to fund capital expenditures  commitments  and other working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes 
on may   we completed a private offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we also issued warrants  which were purchased for per warrant  to acquire an additional  shares of common stock at per share and are exercisable through may  at our election  the warrants may be called at a redemption price of per warrant at any time after any date at which the average daily per share closing bid price for the immediately proceeding consecutive trading days exceeds 
no warrants have been exercised as of december  total proceeds  net of offering costs  were approximately million of which million was used to repay debt under our revolving credit facility in place at the time  with the remainder being utilized to satisfy working capital requirements and to fund a portion of our exploration program 
pursuant to the terms of the private placement  we filed a registration statement with the commission registering the resale of the shares of common stock and the warrants sold in the private placement  as well as the resale of any shares of common stock issued pursuant to such warrants 
we had cash and cash equivalents at december  of  consisting primarily of short term money market investments  as compared to  at december  working capital was million as of december   as compared to million at december  cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in compared to was due primarily to lower net income in  a larger decrease in accrued liabilities for and a lower decrease in accounts receivable for compared to the significant increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to was primarily due to higher net income in  lower accounts receivable balance and higher accrued liabilities at december  compared to the prior year 
we reinvest a substantial portion of our cash flows in our drilling  acquisition  land and geophysical activities 
as a result  we used million in investing activities during capital expenditures of million for the year ended december   were partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties during capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of gross wells  of which were successful 
acquisition costs totaled million for the year ended december   and an additional million in expenditures was attributable to land holdings  including million for increased seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
the remaining capital expenditures were associated with computer hardware and office equipment 
during the year ended december   we used million in investing activities  all of which were capital expenditures 
capital expenditures of million were attributed to drilling gross wells  of which were successful 
acquisition costs totaled million for the year ended december   and an additional million was attributable to land holdings  including million for seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
the remaining capital expenditures were associated with computer hardware and office equipment 
during the year ended december   we used million of cash in investing activities including capital expenditures of approximately million 
capital expenditures of million were attributed to the drilling of gross wells  of which were successful 
capital expenditures of million were attributable to increased land holdings and million was attributable to increased seismic data and other geologic and geophysical expenditures 
these expenditures were offset by proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties of million and net proceeds from the sale of our investment in frontera of million 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures in to be approximately million 
approximately million is allocated to our expected drilling and production activities  million is allocated to land and seismic activities  and million relates to capitalized interest and g a and other 
we plan to fund these expenditures largely from cash flow from operations plus some modest incremental borrowings 
we have not explicitly budgeted for acquisitions  however  we do expect to spend considerable effort evaluating acquisition opportunities 
we expect to fund acquisitions through traditional reserve based bank debt and or the issuance of equity and  if required  through additional debt and equity financings 
cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  including million in borrowings and million in repayments under our current credit facility 
in addition  we received  in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to options exercised in cash flows provided by financing activities in were million  including borrowings of million and repayments of million under our credit facility 
in addition  we received  in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to options exercised in cash flows used in financing activities in were million  including borrowings of million and repayments of million under our credit facility and the predecessor facility 
we incurred loan costs of approximately  during in establishing our new credit facility 
due to our active exploration  development and acquisition activities  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial working capital requirements 
we intend to fund our capital expenditures  commitments and working capital requirements through cash flows from operations  and to the extent necessary other financing activities 
the projected cash flows from operations are estimated to be sufficient to fund our budgeted exploration and development program 
we believe we will be able to generate capital resources and liquidity sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and meet such financial obligations as they come due 
in the event such capital resources are not available to us  our drilling and other activities may be curtailed 
see items and business and properties forward looking information and risk factors our operations have significant capital requirements 
credit facility in october  the company entered into a new credit facility the credit facility with a bank 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to prime plus or libor plus 
as of december   million in borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility matures october  and is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
originally the borrowing base under the credit facility was million and was subject to automatic reductions at a rate of  per month beginning october  in march  the credit facility was amended to increase the borrowing base to million  and to eliminate the  per month automatic reduction 
in january  the borrowing base was increased to million 
in august  the borrowing base was increased to million 
the borrowing base is expected to be redetermined in the first half of the credit facility provides for certain restrictions  including but not limited to  limitations on additional borrowings and issues of capital stock  sales of oil and natural gas properties or other collateral  engaging in merger or consolidation transactions 
the credit facility also prohibits dividends and certain distributions of cash or properties and certain liens 
the credit facility also contains certain financial covenants

the statement supersedes accounting principals board  apb  opinion no 
 intangible assets  and carries forward provisions in apb opinion no 
related to internally developed intangible assets 
under this statement  goodwill is no longer to be amortized but is subject to annual impairment analysis 
we adopted this statement as of january   and we do not have any goodwill or intangible assets recorded as of december  in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity increases the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
accretion of the liability is recognized each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   therefore we have adopted sfas no 
effective january  using a cumulative effect approach to recognize transition amounts for asset retirement obligations  asset retirement costs and accumulated depreciation 
we currently do not include dismantlement and abandonment costs in the depletion calculation as the vast majority of our properties are onshore and the salvage value of the tangible equipment typically offsets our dismantlement and abandonment costs 
this standard will require us to record a liability for the fair value of our dismantlement and abandonment costs  excluding salvage values 
we expect that the adoption of the statement will result in the recognition of additional liabilities related to asset retirement obligations of approximately million

hedging activities in march  we purchased a floor on  mmbtus per day at per mmbtu for the period april  through june   at a cost of  on august   we entered into a price swap on  mmbtus per day at per mmbtu for the period september  through december  on august   we entered into a second price swap on an additional  mmbtus per day at per mmbtu for the period september  through december  in october  we entered into a natural gas collar that covered  mmbtus per day for the period january  to december  at a floor of per mmbtu and a ceiling of per mmbtu 
at december   the market value of outstanding hedges was approximately million and is included in accrued liabilities 
due to the instability of oil and natural gas prices  we have entered into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps  collars and floors for a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure from price fluctuations 
while the use of these arrangements limits our ability to benefit from increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it also reduces our potential exposure to adverse price movements 
our hedging arrangements  to the extent we enter into any  apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices and limits our potential gains from future increases in prices 
our board of directors sets all of our hedging policies  including volumes  types of instruments and counter parties  on a quarterly basis 
these policies are implemented by management through the execution of trades by the chief financial officer after consultation and concurrence by the president and chairman of the board 
we account for these transactions as hedging activities and  accordingly  realized gains and losses are included in oil and natural gas revenue during the period the hedged transactions occur 
see items and business and properties marketing 
tax matters at december   we have cumulative net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that will begin to expire in we anticipate that all of these nols will be utilized in connection with federal income taxes payable in the future 
nols assume that certain items  primarily intangible drilling costs have been written off for tax purposes in the current year 
however  we have not made a final determination if an election will be made to capitalize all or part of these items for tax purposes in the future 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we use a credit facility  which has a floating interest rate  to finance a portion of our operations 
we are not subject to fair value risk resulting from changes in our floating interest rates 
the use of floating rate debt instruments provide a benefit due to downward interest rate movements but does not limit us to exposure from future increases in interest rates 
based on the year end december  outstanding borrowings and a floating interest rate of  a change in interest rate would result in an increase or decrease of interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
in the normal course of business we enter into hedging transactions  including commodity price collars  swaps and floors to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements  but not for trading or speculative purposes 
during october  due to the instability of prices and to achieve a more predictable cash flow  we put in place a natural gas collar for a portion of our production 
while the use of these arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it also limits the downside risk of adverse price movements 
the natural gas collar covers  mmbtu per day for the period january  to december  at a floor of per mmbtu and ceiling of per mmbtu 
at december   the fair value of the outstanding hedge was approximately million 
a change in the gas price per mmbtu  as long as the price is either above the ceiling or below the floor price would cause the fair value total of the hedge to increase or decrease by approximately million
