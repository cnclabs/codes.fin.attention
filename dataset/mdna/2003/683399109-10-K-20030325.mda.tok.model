item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan  predict  potential  believe  should and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appearing throughout our k are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily regarding our operations 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including those set forth under business and additional business risks  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of novel cancer therapies  and we have proprietary technologies that target the molecular basis of cancer 
we are developing small molecule drugs  including bay in co development with bayer pharmaceuticals corporation 
bay is an orally active agent that blocks the inappropriate growth signals in tumor cells by inhibiting raf kinase  which is an enzyme activated by ras to induce cancer cell growth 
together with bayer  we initiated phase ii clinical trials of bay in the second half of in patients with hepatocellular  or liver  melanoma  renal and other cancers 
in addition  there are eight ongoing phase ib clinical trials focused on studying the agent in combination with a range of standard chemotherapeutic agents 
we are also conducting a phase i clinical trial in canada in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome 
we plan to initiate the first phase iii clinical trial of bay by the end of also in our small molecule program  warner lambert company  a subsidiary of pfizer  inc  continues research projects from our previously concluded cell cycle program  including a cell cycle inhibitor targeting a cyclin dependent kinase that may enter phase i clinical trials in late or early our preclinical portfolio includes proprietary viruses and armed therapeutic virus tm products 
we are developing human viruses that target tumor cells with specific genetic mutations 
onyx is a human virus genetically engineered to selectively replicate in and kill cancer cells based on mutations or loss of function of the retinoblastoma  or rb  tumor suppressor gene 
we have demonstrated that onyx has anticancer activity in animal models and have shown in other preclinical studies that onyx has activity following systemic  or intravenous  administration 
we are advancing onyx toward clinical trials  with the goal of filing an investigational new drug  or ind  application with the us food and drug administration  or fda  in we are currently seeking a corporate collaborator to support the further development of onyx and other products in our therapeutic virus program 
in september  we terminated our collaboration agreement with warner lambert and regained full rights to develop and commercialize onyx and an armed therapeutic virus product 
the collaboration agreement had been amended in august  and at that time we assumed all financial and development responsibility for onyx onyx is a human virus that targets tumor cells functionally defective in p in january  we restructured our operations to reflect an increased priority on the development of bay and suspended the development of onyx  including clinical trials and manufacturing activities  pending the outcome of ongoing collaboration discussions 
we also reduced staff levels by approximately percent 
we anticipate that we will recognize approximately million of restructuring charges in the first quarter of primarily related to employee termination costs 
we expect that the suspension of the onyx development program and the reduction in force will reduce our quarterly expenses  excluding restructuring and related one time charges  to million from million in the fourth quarter of in february  we raised gross proceeds of million in a private placement of common stock at a price of per share 
in may  we raised gross proceeds of million in a private placement of common stock at a price of per share and issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
we have not been profitable since inception and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to expenses associated with the development and commercialization of bay we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our research and development efforts  the results of the bay clinical trials  our dependence on collaborative parties  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
we do not expect to generate revenues from the sale of proposed products in the foreseeable future 
we expect that all of our revenues in the foreseeable future will be generated from collaboration agreements 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition and use of estimates to be critical policies 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the related costs are incurred and the four following basic criteria of revenue recognition are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of the criteria regarding the nature of the fee charged for products or services delivered and the collectibility of those fees are based on management s judgments 
contract revenue from collaborations revenue from non refundable  up front license or technology access payments under license and collaboration agreements that are not dependent on future performance under the arrangements is recognized when such amounts are received 
if we have continuing obligations to perform  such up front fees are recognized over the period of continuing performance obligation 
we recognize contract revenue by providing research services on a best efforts basis to certain collaborative partners 
we are reimbursed based on the costs associated with the number of full time equivalent employees working on each specific contract 
we recognize revenue under these arrangements as the related research and development costs are incurred  which is generally on a ratable basis over the life of the contract 
deferred revenue may result when we do not incur the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective contract 
milestone payments under collaboration arrangements are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone events  which represent the culmination of an earnings process  because we have no future performance obligations related to the payment 
milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to onyx  such as regulatory approvals  the commencement of clinical trials or selection of candidates for drug development 
amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue until the related milestone is achieved 
research and development expense in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for research and development costs  research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
research and development consists of costs incurred for independent and collaborative research and development activities 
the major components of research and development costs include salaries and employee benefits  clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  supplies and materials  equipment depreciation and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
research and development expenses under the collaborative research and development agreements approximated the revenue recognized under the collaboration agreements  exclusive of milestone payments and up front license fees received 
use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments include determining the useful lives of fixed assets for depreciation and amortization calculations  assumptions for valuing stock options and estimated lives of license and collaboration agreements related to deferred revenue 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
results of operations years ended december   and total revenue 
our total revenue in each of the last three years were derived almost exclusively from collaborative research and development programs with warner lambert  a related party 
the approximate revenue from each of our programs  and other sources for each of the past three years were as follows year ended december  in millions warner lambert onyx and armed therapeutic viruses cell cycle inflammation bayer total contract revenues all other sources total revenue in  total revenue of million reflected research funding for the therapeutic virus collaboration 
total revenue decreased by million or percent from to this decrease is primarily due to the termination of reimbursement for onyx development costs from warner lambert as a result of the amended agreement announced in august also in august  our small molecule research collaborations concluded with warner lambert  and we did not receive any further funding related to these programs after that date 
in addition  based on the termination of the therapeutic virus research collaboration with warner lambert in september  no further funding was received for this program 
total revenue decreased by million or percent from to as mentioned above  this decrease is primarily due to the fact that we no longer received reimbursement for onyx development costs from warner lambert after august and because the cell cycle and inflammation collaborations with warner lambert concluded in august for fiscal year  revenue also included million received from warner lambert upon the completion of a research milestone in the therapeutic virus research program 
currently  we do not expect to receive any contract revenue in research and development expenses 
research and development consists of costs incurred for independent and collaborative research and development 
below are a summary of products and the related stages of development for each product in clinical development 
the major components of research and development costs include salaries and employee benefits  clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  supplies and materials  equipment depreciation and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential products 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and includes proof of concept in animals and phase i  ii and iii clinical studies in humans  each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
success in development results in increasing expenditures  and the timing for completion of these steps may be uncertain 
product program technology indication status bay small molecule inhibitor of raf kinase single agent trials for hepatocellular  melanoma  renal and other cancers phase ii eight combination trials with standard chemotherapy phase ib single agent trial in acute myelogenous leukemia  myelodysplastic syndrome phase i cell cycle kinases small molecule inhibitor cyclin dependent kinase multiple tumor types preclinical onyx rb selective replicating virus multiple tumor types preclinical armed therapeutic virus tm products rb selective replicating viruses armed with anticancer genes multiple tumor types preclinical research and development expenses were million in  a net increase of million or percent from million of the increased expenses related to the co development of bay with bayer due to multiple ongoing phase i clinical trials and phase ii clinical trials initiated in the second half of phase i clinical trials were initiated in july  and effective with the commencement of clinical trials  we are currently funding percent of bay clinical development costs 
million of the increased expenses were attributable to development costs of onyx  including process development and manufacturing expenses incurred under the agreement with xoma us llc  as well as increased costs for clinical trials for onyx the increase in expenses for our bay and onyx development programs was partially offset by decreased expenses of million for earlier stage therapeutic virus and small molecule research programs  which were terminated in in december  we restructured our research function and reduced staff levels by approximately percent  which accounted for employee related expense decreases in research and development expenses were million in  an increase of million or percent from million of the increase in expenses was attributable to development costs for onyx  including process development and manufacturing expenses incurred under the agreement with xoma 
million of the increased expenses related to the co development and clinical trial costs of bay with bayer 
we expect our research and development expenses in to decrease from levels 
to meet the growing financial requirements of bay  in january  we suspended the clinical development of onyx  including clinical trials and manufacturing activities  and reduced staff levels by approximately percent pending the outcome of ongoing collaboration discussions 
our product development programs may not result in any approved products 
product candidates that appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality 
furthermore  as part of our business strategy  we have entered into collaborative arrangements with third parties to develop and commercialize our product candidates  and it is uncertain which of our product candidates would be subject to future collaborative arrangements 
development activities are either controlled by or must be agreed to with collaborative parties 
as a result  the impact on costs and timelines are uncertain 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in the section of this report titled additional business risks 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in  a decrease of million or percent from the decrease was primarily related to a decline in employee related expenses as a result of a restructuring and staff reductions at the end of general and administrative expenses were million in  a decrease of million or percent from the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in consulting expenses 
it is anticipated that general and administrative expenses in may decrease slightly from expenses as a result of a restructuring and staff reductions that impacted the administrative functions in january restructuring and other 
in october  we formally adopted and announced a restructuring plan aimed at reducing future operating costs 
we recognized million of restructuring and other charges 
of the million  million related to the impairment of certain long lived assets  million related to employee termination costs  and million related to office closure costs 
we reduced the size of our workforce by approximately percent  primarily impacting the research and administrative functions 
employee termination costs consisted of wage continuation and advance notice pay 
office closure costs included losses on operating leases and asset impairments including leasehold improvements related to vacated facilities and equipment related to research and development programs not expected to continue 
there were no restructuring and other expenses in fiscal years and interest income  net 
we had net interest income of million in  a decrease of million from  primarily due to lower average cash and investment balances 
we had net interest income of million in  an increase of million from the increase was principally due to the million follow on public offering of common stock in october and the million common stock issuance to warner lambert in march  partially offset by cash used in operations  resulting in increased cash and investment balances and thus more interest income for fiscal year other income expense related party 
in november  we sold and licensed to syrrx  inc assets from our small molecules discovery program  including drug targets  related reagents and assays  compound libraries and certain intellectual property rights in exchange for preferred stock valued at million  which was recorded as other income 
the preferred stock value was based on sales of syrrx preferred stock for cash 
in  due to a further round of financing completed by syrrx  we recorded million as other expense to reduce the value of our investment 
we consider the reduction in value of the syrrx investment to be other than temporary 
there was no other income expense related party for fiscal year the chief executive officer of syrrx is a member of our board of directors 
other income 
in  we licensed assets from our small molecules discovery program to a third party for million 
this amount was recorded as other income 
there was no other income for fiscal years and income taxes since our inception  we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were approximately million and for state income tax purposes were approximately million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
realization of these deferred tax assets are dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
if not utilized  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in utilization of net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards before they can be used 
please read note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this form k for further information 
related party transactions in march  we issued and sold  shares of common stock to warner lambert in a private placement  at a price of per share  for aggregate proceeds of million 
we record related party revenue under our collaboration agreements with warner lambert 
please read note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this form k for further information 
in november  we sold and licensed to syrrx assets from the our small molecules discovery program  including drug targets  related reagents and assays  compound libraries and certain intellectual property rights in exchange for syrrx preferred stock valued at million  which was recorded as other income 
the value of the preferred stock was determined based on sales at that time of syrrx preferred stock for cash 
we could also receive royalties on pharmaceutical products resulting from these assets 
the chief executive officer of syrrx is a member of our board of directors 
in may  we issued and sold  shares of common stock in a private placement to a current shareholder and several new investors  at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of million 
we also issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
a member of our board of directors is a managing director of domain associates  llc  one of the participants in the private placement 
we have a loan with a former employee of which approximately million was outstanding at december  and this loan bears interest at per annum 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  our cash expenditures have substantially exceeded our revenues  and we have relied primarily on the proceeds from the sale of equity securities and revenue from collaborative research and development agreements to fund our operations 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  compared to million at december   and million at december  the decrease of million in was primarily attributable to cash used in operating activities of million and capital expenditures of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by the private placement of common stock we completed in may  which raised net proceeds of million 
in addition  we received a million creditable milestone based payment from bayer in august upon initiation of phase ii clinical trials of bay this payment will be repayable to bayer from onyx s share of profits and royalties 
the decrease of million in was primarily attributable to cash used in operating activities of million and capital expenditures of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by the sale of our common stock to warner lambert in march  which raised million 
our cash used in operations was million in  million in and million in the cash was used primarily for co funding clinical development costs with bayer for bay and to fund development expenses including manufacturing and clinical trial costs for onyx expenditures for capital equipment amounted to million in  as compared to million in  and million in we currently expect to make expenditures for capital equipment and leasehold improvements of up to million in we believe that our existing capital resources and interest thereon  proceeds from the million private placement financing completed in february along with cost savings from the january suspension of onyx development will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations through mid in addition  we anticipate that bayer will pay us million under our collaboration agreement during for the initiation of phase iii clinical trials for bay based on our continued co funding of development costs 
pursuant to our collaboration agreement  this amount is repayable to bayer from our share of profits and royalties 
if the initiation of the bay phase iii clinical trials are delayed  and the size and scope of phase ii clinical trials of bay are increased  our clinical program development costs may increase without receiving the advance from bayer 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in the expenditure of these resources before mid  and in any event  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in future periods 
we intend to seek this additional funding through collaborations  public and private equity or debt financings  capital lease transactions or other available financing sources 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years in thousands operating leases  net of sublease income this table does not include any payments under research and development collaborations  as the amount and timing of such payments are not known 
we have leases for  square feet of office and laboratory space in our main facility and  square feet of space in a secondary facility in richmond  california 
in december  we determined that we no longer required the secondary facility as a result of a reduction in force 
in september  we entered into a sublease agreement for  square feet of space in this facility through september  which is also the lease expiration date for this space 
in march  we entered into a sublease agreement for the remaining  square feet of space through october  the lease expiration date for this space 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring  discontinued operations  plant closings  or other exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred 
previous guidance in emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring required that a liability for an exit cost be recognized at the date of a company s commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated by a company after december  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including residual value guarantees issued in conjunction with operating lease agreements 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  our adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in november  the fasb issued eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a company for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf no 
addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
eitf no 
provides guidance with respect to the effect of certain customer rights due to company nonperformance on the recognition of revenue allocated to delivered units of accounting 
eitf no 
also addresses the impact on the measurement and or allocation of arrangement consideration of customer cancellation provisions and consideration that varies as a result of future actions of the customer or the company 
finally  eitf no 
provides guidance with respect to the recognition of the cost of certain deliverables that are excluded from the revenue accounting for an arrangement 
the provision of eitf no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf no 
will have on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the additional disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 or apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for employee stock options 
see note summary of significant accounting policies for disclosures required by sfas in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities which addresses the accounting for certain off balance sheet lease financing 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the adoption of fin is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
by policy  we place our investments with high quality debt security issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer  limit duration by restricting the term  and hold investments to maturity except under rare circumstances 
we classify our cash equivalents or marketable securities as fixed rate if the rate of return on an instrument remains fixed over its term
