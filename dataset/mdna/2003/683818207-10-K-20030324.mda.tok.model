critical accounting policies optelecom s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon optelecom s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires optelecom to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  optelecom evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  and contingencies and litigation 
optelecom bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  inventory and stock based compensation to be critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition revenue from commercial sales is recognized when product is shipped and accepted 
revenues from fixed price contracts  such as contracts from the government  are recognized on the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
optelecom follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revenues from time and materials contracts are recorded at the contract rates times the labor hours plus other direct costs as incurred 
allowance for doubtful accounts optelecom maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of optelecom s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories production materials are valued at the lower of cost or market applied on a standard cost basis 
work in process represents direct labor  materials  and overhead incurred on products not delivered to date 
finished goods inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using standards that approximate actual costs on a specific identification basis 
optelecom writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions as well as historical inventory turnover 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion abp no 
accounting for stock issued to employees using the intrinsic value method 
accordingly  we do not recognize any stock compensation expense related to the granting of stock options with an exercise price equal to the fair value of our stock 
we do not recognize stock compensation expense relating to the granting of stock options when the exercise price is deemed to be less than the fair market value of our stock and  also  when we issue restricted stock to employees 
in our financial statements  we have made pro forma disclosures required by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation using the fair value method 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
the company has not purchased any futures contracts nor purchased or held any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes during the twelve months ended december  and the primary market risk exposure is the risk that interest rates on our outstanding borrowings may increase 
optelecom also faces market risk exposure as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments of the company s foreign subsidiary  paragon 
the company believes this risk is immaterial 
optelecom currently has a bank line of credit with aggregate maximum borrowings totaling approximately million 
an increase in the prime rate a benchmark pursuant to which interest rates applicable to borrowings under the credit facilities may be set equal to another basis points to the current prime rate  for example  would have increased our consolidated interest by approximately  for the twelve months ended december  optelecom has not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to the interest obligations under these lines of credit 
certain risks of foreign operations in december  optelecom purchased paragon which operates primarily in countries outside the united states and is subject to certain risks such as currency exchange rates 
there can be no assurances that these factors will not have an adverse impact on our future international sales or operating results 
we do not currently enter into foreign currency hedging transactions and therefore may be exposed to possible losses on international transactions
