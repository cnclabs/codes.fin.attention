the following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operation 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
general our principal business objective is to generate income for distribution to our unitholders from the transportation of natural gas through our gathering systems 
we completed an initial public offering of our common units in january and used the proceeds of that offering to acquire the gathering systems formerly owned by atlas america 
the gathering systems gather natural gas from wells in eastern ohio  western new york  and western pennsylvania and transport the natural gas primarily to public utility pipelines 
to a lesser extent  the gathering systems transport natural gas to end users 
in january  we acquired the gas gathering system of kingston oil corporation  consisting of approximately miles of pipeline located in southeastern ohio 
the purchase price consisted of  of cash and  common units valued at per unit 
in march  we acquired the gas gathering system of american refining and exploration company  consisting of approximately miles of pipeline located in fayette county  pennsylvania 
the purchase price consisted of  of cash and  common units valued at per unit 
these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  we allocated the purchase prices to the assets acquired based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
in addition to these acquisitions  we added approximately  and miles of pipeline during fiscal years  and  respectively 
on january   we entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the equity interests in triton coal company from new vulcan coal holdings  llc and vulcan intermediary  llc on july   we terminated the agreement 
we have incurred approximately  in costs in connection with the terminated triton transaction through december  pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement  we have requested reimbursement from the vulcan entities of  of the transaction costs 
we have expensed transaction costs of  the difference between costs incurred and those reimbursable by the vulcan entities 
as of december   vulcan has reimbursed us  of these costs 
because atlas america advanced funds to us in order to pay our transaction costs  we have remitted amounts reimbursed thus far to atlas america 
the advances  net of the reimbursements  are included in accounts payable affiliates at december  our remaining reimbursable costs of  are included on our consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable  we expect to collect this amount over the first two quarters of results of operations in the years ended december   and  our principal revenues came from the operation of our pipeline gathering systems which transport and compress natural gas 
two variables which affect our transportation revenues are o the volumes of natural gas transported by us which  in turn  depend upon the number of wells connected to our gathering system  the amount of natural gas they produce  and the demand for that natural gas  and o the transportation fees paid to us which  in turn  depend upon the price of the natural gas we transport  which itself is a function of the relevant supply and demand in the mid atlantic and north eastern areas of the united states 
we set forth the average volumes we transported  our average transportation rates per mcf and revenues received by us for the periods indicated in the following table for the years ended inception through december  december  average daily throughput volumes  in mcf    average transportation rate per mcf 


total transportation revenues    year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our transportation revenue decreased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  this decrease of  resulted from a decrease in the average transportation rate paid to us  partially offset by an increase in the volumes of natural gas we transported 
our average daily throughput volumes were  mcfs in the year ended december  as compared to  mcfs in the year ended december   an increase of  mcfs 
the increase in the average daily throughput volume resulted principally from volumes associated with new wells added to our pipeline system  we turned on line and wells in the years ended december  and  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by the natural decline in production volumes inherent in the life of a well 
our transportation rates are primarily at fixed percentages of the sales price of the natural gas we transport 
our average transportation rate was 
per mcf in the year ended december  as compared to 
per mcf in the year ended december   a decrease of 
per mcf 
the decrease in our average transportation rate resulted from the decrease in the average natural gas price received by producers for gas transported through our pipeline system 
costs and expenses 
our transportation and compression expenses increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of   principally due to the increased volumes of natural gas we transported in our average cost per mcf of transportation and compression was 
in both the years ended december  and the majority of our compressors are under short term leases which will be expiring over the next twelve months 
our general and administrative expenses increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of  
this increase primarily resulted from professional fees of  incurred in connection with the terminated triton transaction see note to the consolidated financial statements and our cost of insurance  reflecting increased operating activities and assets  as well as significant increases in insurance rates in general 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of  
this increase resulted from the increased asset base associated with pipeline extensions and acquisitions partially offset by a reduction in goodwill amortization as compared to the previous period due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  on january  our interest expense increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december  this increase of  resulted primarily from the write off of deferred finance fees of  relating to our former credit facility with pnc bank  which we paid off upon obtaining our current credit facility with wachovia bank 
in addition  we had an increase in the amount of funds borrowed due to an increase in pipeline extensions 
these increases were partially offset by lower borrowing rates 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we commenced operations on january  when the pipeline operations  formerly owned by atlas america  began to be operated for our account 
because our initial year of operations was not a full twelve months  the year ended december  may not be entirely comparable to the period ended december  revenues 
our transportation revenue increased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  the increase of  resulted from an increase in the volumes of natural gas we transported  and an increase in the average transportation fees paid to us 
our average daily throughput volumes were  mcf in the year ended december  as compared to  mcf in the year ended december   an increase of  mcf 
the increase in the average daily throughput volume resulted principally from volumes associated with pipelines acquired during the first quarter of and new wells added to our pipeline system  wells were turned on line in the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by the natural decline in production volumes inherent in the life of a well 
our average transportation rate was 
per mcf in the year ended december  as compared to 
per mcf in the year ended december   an increase of 
per mcf 
the increase in our average transportation rate resulted from the increase in the average natural gas price received by producers for gas transported through our pipeline system 
transportation rates had increased significantly during the year  but had fallen back to an average of 
per mcf for the month ended december  costs and expenses 
our transportation and compression expenses increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of  
our average cost per mcf of transportation and compression was 
in the year ended december  as compared to 
in the year ended december   an increase of 

this increase primarily resulted from an increase in compressor expenses  including lease payments  in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  due to upgrades and additions  and increased costs approximating  associated with operating pipelines acquired in the first quarter of our general and administrative expenses increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of  
this increase primarily resulted from an increase in allocated compensation and benefits  legal and professional fees  due to the increased level of activity associated with acquisitions and an increase in our insurance  reflecting an increase in our operating activities and assets and in insurance rates 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of  
this increase resulted from the increased depreciation associated with pipeline extensions and acquisitions 
our interest expense increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december  this increase of  resulted from borrowings on our credit facility in january and march of to fund two acquisitions and an additional draw in june to fund capital expenditures associated with pipeline extensions 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are for debt service  maintenance capital expenditures  expansion capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our unitholders and general partner 
in addition to cash generated from operations  we have the ability to meet our cash requirements  other than distributions to our unitholders and general partner through borrowings under our credit facility 
in general  we expect to fund o cash distributions and sustaining capital expenditures through existing cash and cash flows from operating activities  o expansion capital expenditures and working capital deficits through the retention of cash and additional borrowings  o interest payments through cash flows from operating activities  and o debt principal payments through additional borrowings as they become due or by the issuance of additional common units 
at december   we had million of remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility 
we recently received a commitment to increase the borrowing capacity to million 
the following table summarizes our financial condition and liquidity at the dates indicated at december  current ratio x x x working capital in thousands   ratio of long term debt to total partners capital 
x 
x n a net cash provided by operations of  in was derived principally from  of income from operations before depreciation and amortization 
this decrease of  in cash provided by operations from resulted primarily from a decrease of  in transportation fees earned by us as a result of lower gas prices received by producers for gas transported through our pipeline system 
the change in the decrease in accounts receivable affiliates in the current year of  resulted primarily from the advance by atlas america for expenses we incurred in connection with the terminated triton acquisition 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   an increase of  from  in the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  consisted of the acquisition of two small pipelines from third parties  and capital expenditures associated with gathering system extensions and compressor upgrades to our existing pipeline systems 
in the year ended december   we used  for the acquisition of one small gathering system and incurred capital expenditures of  for gathering system extensions and compressor upgrades to accommodate new wells drilled by atlas america and its affiliates 
net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  from cash used in financing activities of  in the year ended december  distributions paid to partners in the year ended december  decreased  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of a decrease in net income 
net borrowings during the year increased  to  in the year ended december  due to an increase in pipeline extensions and compressor upgrades 
partnership distributions our partnership agreement requires that we distribute of available cash to our partners within days following the end of each calendar quarter in accordance with their respective percentage interests 
available cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts  less cash disbursements and net additions to reserves  including any reserves required under debt instruments for future principal and interest payments 
our general partner is granted discretion by our partnership agreement to establish  maintain and adjust reserves for future operating expenses  debt service  maintenance capital expenditures  rate refunds and distributions for the next four quarters 
these reserves are not restricted by magnitude  but only by type of future cash requirements with which they can be associated 
when our general partner determines our quarterly distributions  it considers current and expected reserve needs along with current and expected cash flows to identify the appropriate sustainable distribution level 
available cash is initially distributed to our limited partners and to our general partner 
these distribution percentages are modified to provide for incentive distributions to be paid to our general partner if quarterly distributions to unitholders exceed certain specified targets 
incentive distributions are generally defined as all cash distributions paid to our general partner that are in excess of of the aggregate amount of cash being distributed 
the general partner s incentive distribution for the distributions that they received during the year ended december  was capital expenditures our property and equipment was approximately and of our total consolidated assets at december  and  respectively 
capital expenditures  other than the acquisitions of gathering systems  were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these capital expenditures principally consisted of costs relating to expansion of our existing gathering systems to accommodate new wells drilled in our service area and compressor upgrades 
during  we connected wells were connected to our gathering system 
as of december   we were committed to expend approximately million for pipeline extensions 
our capital expenditures could increase materially if the number of wells connected to our gathering systems in fiscal increases significantly 
inflation and changes in prices inflation affects the operating expenses of our gathering systems 
increases in those expenses are not necessarily offset by increases in transportation fees that the gathering operations are able to charge 
we have not been materially affected by inflation because we were formed relatively recently and have only a limited period of operations 
while we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs  we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects 
in addition  the value of the gathering systems has been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas prices 
natural gas prices are subject to fluctuations which we are unable to control or accurately predict 
environmental regulation a continuing trend to greater environmental and safety awareness and increasing environmental regulation has generally resulted in higher operating costs for the oil and gas industry 
we monitor environmental and safety laws and believe we are in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
to date  compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
we cannot assure you that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not  in the future  materially adversely affect our operations through increased costs of doing business or restrictions on the manner in which we conduct our operations 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables set forth our obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual cash obligations less than after total year years years years long term debt   capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations   amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands other commercial commitments less than after total year years years years lines of credit   standby letter of credit guarantees standby replacement commitments other commercial commitments total commercial commitments   critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of actual revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we summarize our significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the critical accounting policies that we have identified are discussed below 
revenue and expenses we routinely make accruals for both revenues and expenses due to the timing of receiving information from third parties and reconciling our records with those of third parties 
we have determined these estimates using available market data and valuation methodologies 
we believe our estimates for these items are reasonable  but there is no assurance that actual amounts will not vary from estimated amounts 
depreciation and amortization we calculate our depreciation based on the estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
however  factors such as usage  equipment failure  competition  regulation or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization 
impairment of assets effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we review our long lived assets for impairment and recognize an impairment loss if estimated future cash flows associated with an asset or group of assets are less than the asset carrying amount 
our gathering systems are subject to numerous factors which could affect future cash flows which we discuss in item  business risk factors 
we continuously monitor these factors and pursue alternative strategies to maintain or enhance cash flows associated with these assets  however  we cannot assure you that we can mitigate the effects  if any  on future cash flows related to any changes in these factors 
goodwill at december   we had million of goodwill  all of which relates to our acquisition of pipeline assets 
we test our goodwill for impairment each year 
our test during the current year resulted in no impairment 
we will continue to evaluate our goodwill at least annually and will reflect the impairment of goodwill  if any  in operating income in the income statement in the period in which the impairment is indicated 
recently issued financial accounting standards recently the financial accounting standards boards issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas establishes requirements for accounting for removal costs associated with asset retirements and sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after september   with earlier adoption encouraged  and sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently assessing the impact of the adoption sfas on our results of operations and financial position 
the adoption of sfas had no impact on our operations or financial position 
in may  sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections was issued 
sfas rescinds the automatic treatment of gains or losses from extinguishments of debt as extraordinary unless they meet the criteria for extraordinary items as outlined in apb no 
 reporting the results of operations  reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas also requires sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to a sale leaseback transaction and makes various technical corrections to existing pronouncements 
sfas is effective for all financial statements issued by us after january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses significant issues relating to the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities  and nullifies the guidance in emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars  and as a result  we do not have exposure to currency exchange risks 
we do not engage in any interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price hedging transactions  and as a result  we do not have exposure to derivatives risk 
our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to natural gas sales 
realized pricing is primarily driven by spot market prices for natural gas 
pricing for natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years 
market risk inherent in our debt is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates 
changes in interest rates usually do not affect the fair value of variable rate debt  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
at december   we had a million revolving credit facility to fund the expansion of our existing gathering systems and the acquisition of other gas gathering systems 
we have a commitment to increase this facility was increased to million 
the carrying value of our debt was million at december  at our option  the facility bears interest at the lending institution s prime rate plus to basis points or the euro rate  which is the average of specified libors plus or basis points  depending upon our utilization of the line 
at december   the interest rate was 
at december  and  respectively  a hypothetical change in the average interest rate applicable to this debt would result in a change of approximately  and  in our annual net income and would not affect the market value of this debt
