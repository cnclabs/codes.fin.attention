item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis overview kerr mcgee corporation is one of the largest us based independent oil and gas exploration and production companies and the world s third largest producer and marketer of titanium dioxide pigment 
the company s assets total approximately billion  and proved oil and gas reserves are approximately billion barrels of oil equivalent 
the equity production capacity for titanium dioxide pigment is  tonnes per year 
for  revenues from continuing operations totaled billion  of which billion was generated by the company s oil and gas exploration and production operations and billion was generated by the company s chemical operations 
operating environment and outlook oil and gas exploration and production while the financial results are disappointing  kerr mcgee has started in a stronger position as a result of its program to sell noncore and higher cost oil and gas assets 
these sales yielded proceeds of approximately million during  and completion of additional transactions is expected in the proceeds have enabled the company to reduce total debt by from the year end level 
kerr mcgee s goal is to reduce its debt to capitalization ratio below 
as the company benefits from the sale of the higher cost fields and ramps up production from efficient new deepwater projects  lifting costs are expected to decline by approximately per barrel of oil equivalent 
the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices has a significant impact on the profitability of kerr mcgee s oil and gas exploration and production business 
while financial instruments and marketing arrangements have the potential to dampen this volatility in certain circumstances  the uncertainty surrounding commodity markets  directly affected by geopolitical issues and global economies  must be analyzed in projecting future sales environments 
to provide greater predictability of cash flow necessary to fund exploration and capital programs  the company hedged about of its production and currently has hedged approximately half of its production 
the oil and gas industry operated in an environment of uncertainty during the effects of the september terrorist attack still lingered in the global economy  with discernible global consequences 
concerns about possible military action in the middle east set in early in the year 
venezuela dealt with political strife that began in and led to a general strike in despite early expectations  the us economy did not experience the recovery anticipated early in the year  and financial markets were impacted by a series of corporate scandals 
the resulting commercial environment and price volatility profoundly impacted investment decisions by the oil and gas industry 
the us petroleum market began the year with ample inventories carried over from the price of crude oil hovered near per barrel 
reacting to weak prices due to sluggish demand  opec and significant non opec producers cut back production effective january  geopolitical uncertainties  combined with the surprisingly high quota compliance by opec and non opec producers and their agreement to extend the quota reduction into the second quarter supported oil price recovery 
by the end of the first quarter  the well referenced west texas intermediate wti spot price for crude oil had surpassed per barrel 
after reaching the top of the average range during the first quarter  crude oil inventories in the us began to slide in april  reflecting the effect of the production cuts 
as the us entered the summer driving season  a self imposed day delivery cutoff by iraq increased market tension 
crude oil stocks began a steep decline  reaching the lower level of the historical average range by the end of august 
tightening of demand supply market fundamentals as well as geopolitical events caused late year upward pressure on the crude oil market 
tropical storms also influenced crude oil markets  causing us crude oil stocks to briefly decline to historically low levels 
the spot price of wti soared above per barrel 
us crude oil stocks increased in the fourth quarter  tracking at the lower end of the historical average range 
by the end of the year  when crude oil imports declined again due to the strike in venezuela  the wti spot price briefly climbed over per barrel 
reacting to an economy characterized by uncertainty  caution and concern over investment risk  us oil consumption rose only slightly on the strength of continued increases in transportation sector use 
opec discipline  a perceived premium associated with the possibility of war in the middle east and low levels of crude oil stocks the lowest in five years added near term upward pressure to cyclical demand 
natural gas pricing also demonstrated strong upward movement during the year 
natural gas prices are driven by weather  pipeline capacity  storage capacity and management and supply reliability 
the increase in natural gas prices was partially due to the competitive fuel prices and the evident decline of production in north america 
market signals require time to develop a supply response 
strong downward pressure on natural gas prices through  plus the relatively full levels of natural gas storage at the end of the heating season  contributed to uncertainty that translated into unexpectedly low drilling activity as the year progressed 
reference new york mercantile exchange nymex gas prices began the year at per million british thermal units mmbtu  declined to about mmbtu during february when storage levels were relatively high  and rose to mmbtu by the end of the first quarter 
after trending lower through the summer  prices began to reflect anticipated heating season loads and declining deliverability  climbing steadily to mmbtu by year end 
the upstream oil and gas environment at the end of was nearly the reverse of that which characterized the beginning of the year 
oil prices were relatively high  natural gas prices were extremely strong and natural gas demand appeared to be rising  but drilling activity  which increased slowly during the year  did not yet reflect levels that historically have been characteristic of periods during which there is investment in new supply 
due to global economic conditions  mixed signals from the marketplace  and numerous regulatory and financial uncertainties  the level of concern that permeated the early part of the year progressed to an investment climate of extreme caution 
diligence in investment choosing only the most value added opportunities replaced an industry quest for increased exploration investment 
in this environment of market volatility and uncertainty  budget discipline and flexibility in near term spending are high priorities 
kerr mcgee s growth strategy for its exploration and production operating unit is focused primarily on the deepwater gulf of mexico and selected international basins 
in addition  the company will continue to pursue opportunities in the uk north sea  uk onshore  gulf of mexico shelf and china 
the company expects to build growth through the drill bit and to seek strategic partnerships and acquisitions 
chemicals in the global titanium dioxide pigment industry  the company is the third largest producer and marketer and one of five companies that own chloride technology 
the chloride process produces a pigment with optical properties preferred by the paint and plastics industries 
in early  chloride technology accounted for about of the company s pigment production capacity 
the remaining capacity is sulfate process production 
titanium dioxide is a quality of life product  and its consumption follows general economic trends 
since a low point in the business cycle was experienced in the winter of  economic growth indicators associated with pigment demand improved at a moderate pace 
this strengthening demand for the company s pigment products supported price increases throughout modest growth in the us economy is expected to continue in  bolstered by strong automotive and construction markets 
further supporting this outlook are recent early signals of a rebound in business confidence 
outside the us  moderate growth in the euro zone and japanese gross domestic products is expected to continue 
in southeast asia  where growth is well in excess of other regions  significant progress has been made toward trade facilitation in the area of customs and through elimination of technical barriers 
the kerr mcgee chemical operating unit s strategy focuses on technology improvements and cost control 
this includes an integrated portfolio of supply chain initiatives  continuous improvement and technology based efficiency programs 
accordingly  operating results should improve with the success of these initiatives as well as the price increases that began in and are expected to continue through during  the company will continue its low cost plant capacity expansions in line with market growth 
the company also remains focused on exiting noncore businesses within its chemical operations  while growing new opportunities aligned with its core competencies 
new opportunities for capitalizing on the company s experience are carefully considered 
one such opportunity is avestor 
this joint venture with hydro quebec  one of north america s largest utilities  was formed in to produce a revolutionary lithium metal polymer battery 
commercial sales will begin in with batteries that increase the reliability of telecommunication networks during power outages 
work is under way on future applications  including peak power shaving and use in electric and hybrid electric vehicles 
the company is committed to growing this business and expects to invest an additional million in the joint venture in in january  kerr mcgee announced a plan to close its synthetic rutile plant in mobile  alabama  by year end this plant closure is another step in the company s plan to enhance its operating profitability 
the mobile plant processes and supplies a portion of the feedstock for the company s titanium dioxide pigment plants in the united states 
through kerr mcgee s ongoing supply chain initiatives  the company now can purchase the feedstock more economically than it can be manufactured at the mobile plant 
as a result of these steps  the company anticipates significant savings 
during march  the company announced the temporary shutdown of the mobile synthetic rutile plant due to imposition of a new  much lower limit for one effluent impurity effective march  this limit did not exist previously under the plant s operating permit 
the synthetic rutile plant will remain shut down until kerr mcgee is confident it can meet this new permit condition 
results of consolidated operations net income loss and per share amounts for each of the years in the three year period ended december   were as follows millions of dollars  except per share amounts net income loss net income loss per share basic diluted the major variances in net income on an operating unit basis after income taxes are outlined in the table below 
the variances in individual line items in the consolidated statement of operations are explained in the section that follows 
favorable unfavorable variance versus versus millions of dollars exploration and production net operating profit chemical pigment net operating profit chemical other net operating profit net interest expense other income expense discontinued operations cumulative effect of accounting change net income the majority of the decline in exploration and production net operating profit resulted from asset impairments of million and the deferred tax effect of million for the increase in the uk corporate tax rate for oil and gas companies 
the remaining million decrease is due principally to higher lease operating expense  shipping and handling expense  depreciation and depletion  and exploration expense 
the improvement in chemical s pigment net operating profit in is principally the result of higher pigment sales volumes and lower average per unit production costs 
higher interest expense in is due to significantly higher average debt outstanding and lower capitalized interest  partially offset by a lower overall average interest rate 
the negative variance for other income expense is mainly due to the adoption of the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  as amended  that allowed the company to reclassify of the devon energy corporation devon shares owned to trading from the available for sale category of investments 
this resulted in a million net unrealized gain on the stock being recognized in income as of january   with a corresponding reduction in other comprehensive income where the unrealized gain had previously been recorded 
additionally  a net of tax litigation provision of million and after tax foreign currency losses of million contributed to the other income expense variance for versus discontinued operations for all three years resulted from the company s decision in early to dispose of its exploration and production interests in indonesia and kazakhstan and its interest in the bayu undan project in the east timor sea offshore australia 
these divestiture decisions were made as part of the company s strategic plan to rationalize noncore oil and gas properties 
all periods presented have been restated to reflect these interests as discontinued operations in the financial statements 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle is the result of the company s adoption of fas in this standard required the recording of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
kerr mcgee recorded the fair value of all its outstanding foreign currency forward contracts and the fair value of the options associated with the company s debt exchangeable for stock decs of devon presently owned by the company 
the net effect of recording these fair values resulted in a million decrease in income as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and a million reduction in equity other comprehensive income for the foreign currency contracts designated as hedges 
the decrease in exploration and production net operating profit primarily was due to significantly lower average sales prices and volumes for crude oil and natural gas  the hutton uk north sea asset impairment in and higher exploration  gas gathering  pipeline and transportation expenses 
the decline in net operating profit from chemicals resulted mainly from lower pigment sales prices and volumes  the provisions for closure of the pigment plant in belgium  asset impairments  severance and other costs 
the other income expense variance was mainly the result of the million unrealized gain on devon stock reclassified to the trading category of investments  discussed above 
statement of operations comparisons sales billions of dollars oil and gas and pigment sales increased in compared with the increase in sales primarily was due to a full year of revenues from the rocky mountain region compared with only five months in following the acquisition of hs resources  combined with the favorable impact of higher pigment sales volumes  partially offset by the recognition of lower revenues from properties divested during the decrease in revenues compared with was due primarily to a decrease in crude oil and pigment sales prices and volumes  partially offset by five months of revenues from the rocky mountain region 
these variances are discussed in more detail in the segment discussion that follows 
costs and operating expenses increased million in from the level  resulting principally from higher gas marketing and pipeline costs of million full year of rocky mountain operations in versus five months in  higher lease operating expenses of million higher crude oil and natural gas production volumes and higher pigment production cost of million increased pigment production volumes 
the costs and operating expenses increased million over  principally due to costs for closing the pigment plant in belgium  discontinuation of manganese metal production at hamilton  mississippi  and the write down of certain pigment inventories 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased million primarily as a result of the million reserve for litigation established mainly in connection with certain forest products litigation in mississippi  louisiana and pennsylvania 
these lawsuits are discussed in note to the financial statements 
the selling  general and administrative expenses increased million over the expenses 
this increase resulted principally from the acquisition of hs resources in august  completion of the integration of the two chemical plants acquired in the second quarter of  higher costs for information technology projects  higher incentive compensation based on performance and higher chemical warehousing costs due to higher inventory levels 
shipping and handling expenses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to higher costs for shipping product from the new deepwater fields in the gulf of mexico  including nansen  boomvang and navajo  and higher costs in the rocky mountain region due to the inclusion of the first full year of costs related to the former hs resources operations 
the increase was due to higher natural gas sales volumes  mainly from five months of rocky mountain sales and increased transportation costs in the north sea 
depreciation and depletion expense totaled million in  million in and million in the increase was due to higher depreciation and depletion for the rocky mountain region of million full year of expense and for the uk region of million mainly due to a full year of expense on the leadon and skene fields  partially offset by having no depreciation on certain assets while they were held for sale 
partially offsetting these increases was lower expense in the us offshore region of million due to normal declines in production and held for sale properties  which more than offset the impact of production from the nansen  boomvang and navajo fields 
the increase was due to a million charge for discontinued capital projects and write off of certain assets no longer used in the pigment operations  the acquisition of hs resources in august  the oil and gas production mix in the other regions  and a full year of depreciation for the two chemical plants acquired in the second quarter of asset impairments totaled million in and million in these impairments were due to certain assets that were no longer expected to recover their net book values through future cash flows 
the impairments in included million for the leadon field in the north sea 
the field had been producing lower volumes than initially anticipated due to water breakthrough and reservoir compartmentalization 
the company conducted additional drilling and field performance analysis during the third and fourth quarters of  and after considering various alternatives for the field  the asset was written down to its fair value based on expected future cash flows 
the impairment assumes the tieback of all subsea wells to other fixed infrastructure in the area possibly the kerr mcgee operated gryphon field  allowing the company to monetize the leadon state of the art floating facility by marketing it as a development option for another discovery 
should the company be unsuccessful in marketing the leadon vessel or unable to tie the field back to other existing infrastructure  kerr mcgee would expect to continue with the leadon vessel in place and produce from the existing wells until they are fully depleted 
in addition  the company impaired to fair market value certain northern north sea and us onshore and offshore noncore exploration and production assets identified in early for divestiture totaling million 
impairments totaling million for several older gulf of mexico shelf properties and certain other north sea fields were also recorded  primarily due to the write down of underlying oil and gas reserves 
additionally  a million asset impairment was recognized in connection with the company s planned shutdown of the forest products operations 
the impairments were comprised of a million write down associated with the shut in of the north sea hutton field and million for certain chemical facilities in belgium and the us exploration costs were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase was due to higher dry hole costs of million  mainly in the deepwater area of the gulf of mexico and in the north sea  higher nonproducing leasehold amortization of million  and higher geophysical costs of million 
the million increase in was primarily the result of higher planned exploratory drilling in brazil  gabon  australia and china  higher geophysical costs  principally from the hs resources acquisition  and higher amortization of nonproducing leaseholds 
during  the company plans to drill additional wells and to continue seismic work on deepwater blocks offshore benin  brazil  morocco and nova scotia 
the success of these projects will impact the company s future exploration costs 
in connection with the company s second quarter acquisition of the pigment plant in savannah  georgia  certain incomplete research and development projects were identified and valued as part of the purchase price 
since these projects had no alternative future use to the company  million was expensed at the date of acquisition 
interest and debt expense totaled million in  million in and million in the million increase in was due to an annual average debt balance that was approximately billion higher than for and capitalized interest that was lower by million  partially offset by overall average interest rates that were approximately lower than in the prior year 
the lower expense in was due to higher levels of interest being capitalized on major development projects in the gulf of mexico and the north sea and lower interest rates  partially offset by significantly higher borrowings resulting from the august hs resources acquisition and higher capital spending 
other income loss includes the following for each of the years in the three year period ended december  millions of dollars foreign currency translation gain loss income loss from equity affiliates unrealized gain on devon stock reclassified to trading category of investments exchangeable debt derivative options and devon stock revaluations gains on speculative derivative contracts for gas basis swaps acquired with hs resources all other most of the foreign currency loss was a result of the company s uk operations  where the company suffered from the unfavorable us dollar british pound sterling exchange rates 
the loss from equity affiliates for and was primarily the result of the investment in the avestor joint venture formed in to develop new lithium metal polymer batteries 
segment operations operating profit loss from each of the company s segments is summarized in the following table millions of dollars operating profit loss exploration and production  chemicals pigment other total chemicals operating profit loss  exploration and production exploration and production sales  operating profit loss and certain other statistics are shown in the following table millions of dollars  except per unit amounts sales    operating profit loss  exploration expense net crude oil and condensate produced thousands of barrels per day average price of crude oil sold per barrel natural gas sold mmcf per day average price of natural gas sold per mcf average production costs per boe includes the results of the company s hedging program that reduced the average price of crude oil and natural gas sold by per barrel and 
per mcf  respectively 
sales increased million in compared with  primarily driven by a million increase in rocky mountain gas marketing and other operating income  partially offset by a decrease of million in crude oil and natural gas sales resulting from lower average sales prices  partially offset by higher sales volumes 
average sales prices decreased for crude oil and for natural gas  resulting in a decrease in total sales of million 
however  a slight increase in crude oil sales volume  combined with a increase in natural gas sales volume full year of rocky mountain production  resulted in an offsetting increase in sales of million 
sales decreased million from to  of which million was due to a decrease in crude oil sales  partially offset by increases in natural gas sales and other operating revenues of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in crude oil sales resulted from an drop in the average per barrel sales price  causing year over year sales to decline million  combined with a  or million  decrease in sales volumes 
the addition of the hs resources rocky mountain operations accounted for million of the increase in natural gas sales over natural gas sales for existing operations increased million due to higher average sales prices  partially offset by a million decrease resulting from lower sales volumes 
other operating revenues increased million  primarily due to higher tariff income and gas marketing income attributable to the hs resources acquisition 
operating profit  which decreased from million in to a loss of million in  was adversely affected by higher asset impairment losses combined with lower oil and gas sales prices  discussed above  and higher production  exploration and other operating costs driven in part by higher production volumes in in total  million in asset impairment losses were recorded in  compared with million in  lowering operating profit by million between years 
assets held for use represented million of the asset impairment loss  of which million related to the leadon field in the uk area of the north sea 
an additional million was recorded for certain other uk north sea fields  and million was recorded for several older gulf of mexico shelf properties 
during  additional performance analysis of these fields resulted in downward revisions of reserve estimates sufficient to lower future cash flow projections for the properties below the carrying value of the related assets 
the remaining million asset impairment loss related to assets classified as held for disposal in the us  north sea and ecuador 
the asset impairment loss of million was attributable to the shutdown of the hutton field in the north sea 
total operating expenses increased million compared with  due to higher gas marketing and pipeline costs of million primarily an offset to the increased income of million for gas marketing and other  discussed above  higher production expenses of million  higher depreciation and depletion expense of million  higher exploration expense of million  higher environmental expense of million  higher general and administrative expenses of million  and higher transportation costs of million 
the higher production costs  depreciation and depletion expense  and transportation expense resulted primarily from the increased crude oil and natural gas production volumes 
the increase in exploration expense resulted from the company s expanded exploration program during the second half of the decrease in operating profit of million from to was primarily due to the significant decline in average sales prices for crude oil and natural gas  which resulted in a decrease in comparable sales year over year of million  combined with net sales volume decreases of million 
in addition  when compared with  the period included the million north sea hutton field impairment  higher exploration expense of million resulting from the company s planned exploration program  higher gas gathering and pipeline expenses of million of which million was directly attributable to additional costs associated with the acquired hs resources operations  higher transportation expense of million  and higher depreciation and depletion expense of million  offset in part by lower production and general and administrative costs of million 
chemicals chemical sales  operating profit loss and pigment production volumes are shown in the following table millions of dollars sales pigment  other total    operating profit loss pigment other total titanium dioxide pigment production thousands of tonnes pigment titanium dioxide pigment sales for increased million  or  over due to sales volume increases of million  combined with an offsetting decrease of million resulting from weaker sales prices in while poor overall market conditions persisted through the first quarter of  product demand began to increase through the remainder of the year 
as demand accelerated  the company announced multiple price increases through the second half of the year 
the million  or  decrease in titanium dioxide pigment sales from to was due to lower pigment sales prices  resulting in a decrease of million between years and lower sales volumes that caused a drop of million in comparable sales 
the global economic downturn led to reduced customer demand and lower pricing 
operating profit for improved million over higher sales volume  combined with lower average per unit production costs  increased operating profit by million  offset by reductions due to lower sales prices of million 
shipping and handling costs and selling  general and administrative costs decreased million from in addition  the operating profit included a provision of million related to abandoned chemical engineering projects  a million reversal of environmental reserves  and million for severance and other costs  compared with provisions in for closure of a pigment plant in belgium  asset impairments  severance and other costs totaling million 
operating profit in declined million compared with due principally to lower sales of million  coupled with an million increase in operating expenses 
additionally  operating profit in included million in plant closure provisions  asset impairments  severance and other costs  as discussed above  compared with a write off of million for acquired in process research and development projects and million in transition costs incurred in connection with the purchase of two pigment plants 
other operating loss for was million on revenues of million  compared with operating loss of million on revenues of million in the increase in operating loss was primarily due to provisions for the shutdown and impairment of the forest products business of million and environmental provisions of million  compared with provisions of million for the termination of manganese metal production and million for severance and asset impairment charges 
other chemical sales declined million from to  of which million resulted from the discontinued production of manganese metal  million was due to lower manganese dioxide sales  and million was due to lower forest products sales 
operating profit decreased million between periods  primarily due to the million in charges discussed above  related to the discontinuation of manganese metal production  severance charges and asset impairments 
financial condition millions of dollars current ratio to to to total debt    total debt less cash    stockholders equity    total debt less cash to total capitalization floating rate debt to total debt the negative working capital at the end of is not indicative of a lack of liquidity as the company maintains sufficient current assets to settle current liabilities when due 
current asset balances are minimized as one way to finance capital expenditures and lower borrowing costs 
additionally  the company has sufficient unused lines of credit and revolving credit facilities as discussed in the liquidity section that follows 
kerr mcgee operates with a philosophy that over a plan period the company s capital expenditures and dividends will be paid from cash generated by operations 
on a cumulative basis  the cash generated from operations for the past four years has exceeded the company s capital expenditures and dividend payments 
debt and equity transactions are utilized for acquisition opportunities and short term needs due to timing of cash flow 
net debt to total capitalization percentages net debt to total capitalization is total debt less cash divided by total debt less cash plus stockholders equity 
although debt was reduced million from  the decrease in equity resulting primarily from the net loss and dividends declared resulted in a slightly higher percentage of net debt to total capitalization as compared to the higher percentage of net debt to total capitalization in resulted from the debt issued and assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of hs resources and the expenditures for major development projects in the gulf of mexico and the north sea 
cash flow net cash flow from operating activities millions of dollars net cash flow from operating activities increased    million in net cash flow from operating activities increased million  from billion in to billion in  primarily as a result of changes in various working capital items  partially offset by a decrease in income excluding noncash items 
year end cash was million  compared with million at december  the company invested billion in its capital program  which included million of unsuccessful exploratory drilling costs 
the capital program for was million lower than in the prior year  resulting in part from the completion of the major construction on certain field developments in the north sea and the gulf of mexico in late and early during  the company completed the divestiture of several oil and gas properties and other assets  generating proceeds of million 
these proceeds were used primarily to lower debt 
the company also invested million to acquire an additional interest in the janice field in the uk north sea  bringing its working interest to 
cash outlays for investing activities include a million investment by the chemical unit in avestor  its lithium metal polymer battery joint venture in canada  and an additional million investment for the company s share of construction costs for the caspian pipeline by the exploration and production operating unit 
other investing activities provided million of net cash 
total debt millions of dollars outstanding debt was reduced million in    during  the company issued million of notes due april in connection with this issuance  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement  the terms of which effectively change the fixed interest rate on the notes to a variable rate of libor plus 
variable interest rate commercial paper and revolving credit borrowings were reduced by million on a net basis in  and other debt and short term borrowings were reduced million 
cash flow was used to pay the company s dividends of million in as of december   the company s senior unsecured debt was rated bbb by standard poor s and fitch and the equivalent by moody s 
see note for details of the company s debt 
at december   the company s outstanding debt had increased significantly from prior year levels to fund the acquisition of hs resources and major development projects in the gulf of mexico and the north sea 
throughout  the company aggressively pursued its strategy of divesting noncore and high cost assets  the proceeds from which have been used primarily to reduce the company s outstanding debt 
the company expects to further reduce debt during using proceeds from the divestiture of its exploration and production operations in kazakhstan  which are expected to total approximately million  and from excess cash flow 
liquidity the company believes that it has the ability to provide for its operational needs and its long and short term capital programs through its operating cash flow partially protected by the company s hedging program  borrowing capacity and ability to raise capital 
the company s primary source of funds has been from operating cash flow  which would be adversely affected by declines in oil  natural gas and pigment prices  all of which can be volatile as discussed in the preceding outlook section 
should operating cash flow decline  the company may reduce its capital expenditures program  borrow under its commercial paper program and or consider selective long term borrowings or equity issuances 
kerr mcgee s commercial paper programs are backed by the revolving credit facilities currently in place 
should the company s commercial paper or debt rating be downgraded  borrowing costs will increase  and the company may experience loss of investor interest in its debt as evidenced by a reduction in the number of investors and or amounts they are willing to invest 
at december   the company had unused lines of credit and committed amounts under revolving credit agreements totaling billion 
the company maintains two revolving credit agreements consisting of a five year million facility signed january   and a day million facility renewed on december  of the two agreements  million and million can be used to support commercial paper borrowings in the us and europe  respectively  by certain wholly owned subsidiaries and are guaranteed by the parent company 
the borrowings can be made in us dollars  british pound sterling  euros or local european currencies 
the company also had a million revolving credit agreement available to its chinese subsidiary through march   when the agreement lapsed and was not renewed 
in addition  the company had other unused credit facilities of million and unused  uncommitted lines of credit of million at december  interest for each of the revolving credit facilities and lines of credit is payable at varying rates 
at december   the company classified million of its short term obligations as long term debt 
the company has the intent and the ability  as evidenced by committed credit agreements  to refinance this debt on a long term basis 
the company s practice has been to continually refinance its commercial paper or draw on its backup facilities  while maintaining borrowing levels believed to be appropriate 
the company issued notes exchangeable for common stock decs in august  which allow each holder to receive between 
and share of devon common stock or  at the company s option  an equivalent amount of cash at maturity in august embedded options in the decs provide the company a floor price on devon s common stock of per share the put option 
the company also retains the right to up to of the shares if devon s stock price is greater than per share the decs holders have a call option on of the shares 
using the black scholes valuation model  the company recognizes in other income loss any gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the put and call options 
the fluctuation in the value of the put and call derivative financial instruments will generally offset the increase or decease in the market value of of the devon stock owned by the company 
the remaining of the devon shares are accounted for as available for sale securities in accordance with fas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  with changes in market value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company also has available  to issue and sell  a total of billion of debt securities  common or preferred stock  or warrants under its shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission  which was last updated in february off balance sheet arrangements during and  the company identified certain financing needs that it determined would be best handled by off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated  special purpose entities 
three leasing arrangements were entered into for financing the company s working interest obligations for the production platforms and related equipment at three company operated fields in the gulf of mexico 
also  the company entered into an accounts receivable monetization program to sell its receivables from certain pigment customers 
each of these transactions has provided specific financing for the company s business needs and or projects and does not expose the company to significant additional risks or commitments 
the leases have provided a tax efficient method of financing a portion of these major development projects  and the sale of the pigment receivables results in lowering the company s overall financing costs as the subject discount rate is lower than the company s short term borrowing rate 
during  the company entered into a leasing arrangement for its interest in the production platform and related equipment for the gunnison field in the garden banks area of the gulf of mexico 
this leasing arrangement is similar to two arrangements entered into in for the nansen and boomvang fields in the east breaks area of the gulf of mexico 
in each of these three arrangements  the company entered into five year lease commitments with separate business trusts that were created to construct independent spar production platforms for each field development 
under the terms of the agreements  the company s share of construction costs for the platforms has been financed by synthetic lease credit facilities between the trust and groups of financial institutions for up to million  million and million for gunnison  nansen and boomvang  respectively  with the company making lease payments sufficient to pay interest at varying rates on the financings 
upon completion of the construction phase  different trusts with third party equity participants become the lessor owner of the platforms and related equipment 
the company and these trusts have entered into operating leases or  where construction is not yet complete  are committed to purchase or sell the platform and related equipment or enter into an operating lease for the use of the spar platform and related equipment 
during  the nansen and boomvang synthetic leases were converted to operating lease arrangements upon completion of construction of the respective production platforms 
completion of the gunnison platform is expected in early  at which time the gunnison synthetic lease will be converted to an operating lease 
under this type of financing structure  the company leases the platforms under operating lease agreements  and neither the platform assets nor the related debt are recognized in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
in conjunction with the operating lease agreements  the company has guaranteed that the residual values of the nansen  boomvang and gunnison platforms at the end of the operating leases shall be equal to at least of their fair market value at the inception of the lease 
for nansen and boomvang  the guaranteed values are million and million  respectively  in  and for gunnison the estimated guaranteed value is million in estimated future minimum annual rentals under these leases and the residual value guarantees are shown in the table of contractual obligations below 
a pigment accounts receivable monetization program began in december under the terms of the credit insurance backed asset securitization  up to million of selected pigment customers accounts receivables may be sold monthly to an unconsolidated special purpose entity spe 
since the collection of the receivables is insured  only receivables that qualify for credit insurance can be sold 
the spe borrows the purchase price of the receivables at a lower interest rate than kerr mcgee s commercial paper rate and shares a portion of the savings with the company through a reduced discount rate on the receivables purchased 
the company records a loss on the receivable sales equal to the difference in the cash received plus the fair value of the retained interests and the carrying value of the receivables sold 
the fair value of the retained interests servicing fees and preference stock of the spe  which is essentially a deposit to provide credit enhancement  if needed  but otherwise recoverable by the company is based on the discounted present value of future cash flows 
at year end  the outstanding balance on receivables sold under the program totaled million 
in the event the program is terminated  kerr mcgee will continue to act as collection agent until all its obligations under the agreement are retired 
any costs resulting from a termination would be covered by the value of the preference stock 
during  the company entered into a sale leaseback arrangement with general electric capital corporation gecc covering assets associated with a gas gathering system in the rocky mountain region 
the lease agreement was entered into for the purpose of monetizing the related assets 
the sales price of the equipment was million  however  an million settlement obligation existed for equipment previously covered by the lease agreement  resulting in net cash proceeds of million 
the operating lease agreement has an initial term of five years  with two month renewal options 
the company may elect to purchase the equipment at specified amounts after the end of the fourth year 
in the event the company does not purchase the equipment and it is returned to gecc  the company guarantees a residual value ranging from million at the end of the initial five year term to million at the end of the last renewal option 
the company recorded no gain or loss associated with the gecc sale leaseback agreement 
estimated future minimum annual rentals under this agreement and the residual value guarantee are shown in the table of contractual obligations below 
in conjunction with the company s sale of its ecuadorean assets  which included the company s nonoperating interest in the oleoducto de crudos pesados ltd 
ocp pipeline  the company has entered into a performance guarantee agreement with the buyer for the benefit of ocp 
under the terms of the agreement  the company guarantees payment of any claims from ocp against the buyer upon default by the buyer and its parent company 
claims would generally be for the buyer s proportionate share of construction costs of ocp  however  other claims may arise in the normal operations of the pipeline 
accordingly  the amount of any such future claims cannot be reasonably estimated 
in connection with this guarantee  the buyer s parent company has issued a letter of credit in favor of the company up to a maximum of million  upon which the company can draw in the event it is required to perform under the guarantee agreement 
the company will be released from this guarantee when the buyer obtains a specified credit rating as stipulated under the guarantee agreement 
obligations and commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into purchase obligations  contracts  leases and borrowing arrangements 
the company has no material debt guarantees for unrelated parties 
as part of the company s project oriented exploration and production business  kerr mcgee routinely enters into contracts for certain aspects of the project  such as engineering  drilling  subsea work  etc 
these contracts are generally not unconditional obligations  thus  the company accrues for the value of work done at any point in time  a portion of which is billed to partners 
kerr mcgee s commitments and obligations as of december   are summarized in the following table millions of dollars payments due by period less than more than type of obligation total year years years years long term debt    operating leases for nansen  boomvang and gunnison all other operating leases leveraged leases drilling rig commitments purchase obligations guarantee of residual values of leased equipment total    in connection with certain contracts and agreements  the company enters into indemnifications related to title claims  environmental matters  litigation and other claims 
because of the inherent uncertainty surrounding these matters  the amount of any future liability related to these indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated 
if a claim is asserted or if information becomes known to management indicating it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated  an accrual is established at that time 
capital spending capital expenditures are summarized as follows millions of dollars est 
exploration and production  chemicals other  including discontinued operations total    capital spending  excluding acquisitions  totaled billion in the three year period ended december   and dividends paid totaled million in the same three year period  which compares with billion of net cash provided by operating activities during the same period 
this reflects the company s philosophy of providing for its capital programs and dividends  along with debt reduction  through internally generated funds 
during the three year period  the company made three major acquisitions that further expanded its global presence the acquisition of hs resources for million cash plus common stock and assumed debt and the acquisitions of repsol sa s north sea oil and gas operations and the kemira us and dutch pigment plants for a total of million 
kerr mcgee has budgeted approximately billion for its capital program in management anticipates that the capital program  dividends and debt reduction can continue to be provided through internally generated funds 
the available capacity for borrowings may be used for selective acquisitions that support the company s growth strategy or to support the company s capital expenditure program should internally generated cash flow fall short in any one measurement period 
oil and gas the company s exploration and production capital spending continues to be focused on global growth and deepwater projects 
of the million total budget for  million is allocated to the gulf of mexico  million to the north sea  million to us onshore and million to other international projects 
successful exploration and appraisal drilling in the deepwater gulf of mexico has resulted in the development of two major projects during the last two years nansen working interest and boomvang  along with north sea developments of leadon  tullich and maclure 
the gunnison and red hawk projects currently under development are also in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
gunnison capitalizes on the success of truss spar technology introduced at the nansen and boomvang fields  while red hawk is being developed using innovative cell spar technology 
gunnison is expected to reach initial production during the first quarter of  with red hawk following in mid the company is also developing discoveries in bohai bay  china  using a centrally located floating production  storage and offloading facility 
these projects plus additional development at nansen and boomvang comprise of the capital budget for the company also expects to fund its share of drilling to exploratory wells in chemicals capital expenditures for chemical operations are budgeted at million for these expenditures will be primarily for chloride oxidation process and technology upgrades aimed at improving the capacity  efficiency and cost effectiveness of the company s pigment operations 
the hamilton  mississippi  plant capacity is expected to reach  tonnes by the end of  up from approximately  tonnes at year end  and the savannah  georgia  chloride plant is expected to reach annual capacity of  tonnes by year end  up from  tonnes 
chemical has also budgeted million of additional investment in avestor for market risks the company is exposed to a variety of market risks  including credit risks  the effects of movements in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and certain commodity prices 
the company addresses its risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of insurance and derivative financial instruments 
see notes and for additional discussions of the company s financial instruments  derivatives and hedging activities 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the us dollar is the functional currency for the company s international operations  except for its european chemical operations for which the euro is the functional currency 
periodically  the company enters into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies 
certain of these contracts purchases of australian dollars and british pound sterling have been designated and have qualified as cash flow hedges of the company s operating and capital expenditure requirements 
these contracts generally have durations of less than three years 
the resulting changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company has entered into other forward contracts to sell foreign currencies  which will be collected as a result of pigment sales denominated in foreign currencies  primarily in euros 
these contracts have not been designated as hedges even though they do protect the company from changes in foreign currency rates 
certain pigment receivables have been sold in an asset securitization program at their equivalent us dollar value at the date the receivables were sold 
however  the company retains the risk of foreign currency rate changes between the date of the sale and collection of the receivables 
following are the notional amounts at the contract exchange rates  weighted average contractual exchange rates and estimated contract values for open contracts at year end and to purchase sell foreign currencies

in connection with the issuance of million notes due april   the company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement in april the terms of the agreement effectively change the interest the company will pay on the debt until maturity from the fixed rate to a variable rate of libor plus 
the company considers the swap to be a hedge against the change in fair value of the debt as a result of interest rate changes 
the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap was million at december  commodity price risk the company has periodically used derivative instruments to reduce the effect of the price volatility of crude oil and natural gas 
effective august   the company purchased of the outstanding shares of common stock of hs resources 
at the time of the purchase  hs resources now kerr mcgee rocky mountain corp 
and its marketing subsidiary now kerr mcgee energy services corp 
had a number of derivative contracts for purchases and sales of gas  basis differences and energy related contracts 
prior to  the company had treated all of these derivatives as speculative and marked to market through income each month the change in derivative fair values 
in  the company designated the remaining portion of the hs resources gas basis swaps that settled in and all that settle in as hedges 
additionally  in march  the company began hedging a portion of its oil and natural gas production to increase the predictability of its cash flows and support additional capital expenditures 
the hedges were in the form of fixed price swaps and covered  barrels of us oil production per day at an average price of per barrel   barrels of north sea oil production per day at an average price of per barrel and  mmbtu of us natural gas production per day at an average price of per mmbtu 
in october  the company expanded the hedging program to cover a portion of the estimated crude oil and natural gas production by adding fixed price swaps  new basis swaps and costless collars 
at december   the outstanding commodity related derivatives accounted for as hedges had a net liability fair value of million  of which million is recorded as a current asset and million is recorded as a current liability 
the fair value of these derivative instruments at december   was determined based on prices actively quoted  generally nymex and dated brent prices 
the company had after tax deferred losses of million in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with these contracts 
the company expects to reclassify the entire amount of these losses into earnings during the next months  assuming no further changes in fair market value of the contracts 
during  the company realized a million loss on domestic oil hedging  a million loss on north sea oil hedging and a million loss on domestic natural gas hedging 
the losses offset the oil and natural gas prices realized on the physical sale of crude oil and natural gas 
losses for hedge ineffectiveness are recognized as a reduction to sales in the consolidated statement of operations and totaled million in at december   the following commodity related derivative contracts were outstanding daily average contract type period volume price natural gas mmbtu mmbtu fixed price swaps nymex  costless collars nymex  basis swaps cig q  q   crude oil bbl bbl fixed price swaps wti q  q  q  q  fixed price swaps brent q  q  q  q  these contracts may be subject to margin calls above certain limits established with individual counterparty institutions

these derivatives are recorded at their fair value of million in investments other assets 
the net gain associated with these derivatives was million in and is included in other income in the consolidated statement of operations 
in  all of the hs resources derivative contracts were treated by the company as speculative and marked to market through income each month 
at december   the fair value of these contracts was million 
the net gain associated with these derivatives was million in and is included in other income in the consolidated statement of operations 
the marketing subsidiary  kerr mcgee energy services kmes markets purchased gas primarily equity gas in the denver area 
existing contracts for the physical delivery of gas at fixed or index plus prices are marked to market in accordance with fas kmes has entered into natural gas basis and price derivative contracts that offset its fixed price risk on physical contracts 
these derivative contracts lock in the margins associated with the physical sale 
the company believes that risk associated with these derivatives is minimal due to the credit worthiness of the counterparties 
the net asset fair value of the physical and offsetting derivative contracts was million at year end of this amount  million was recorded in current assets  million in investments other assets  million in current liabilities and million in deferred credits 
the fair value of the outstanding derivative instruments at december   was based on prices actively quoted  generally nymex futures prices 
during  the net loss associated with these derivative contracts was million and is included in sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
at year end  the net asset fair value of the commodity related derivatives and physical contracts was million 
the net loss associated with these derivative contracts was million and is included in sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
the losses on the derivative contracts are generally offset by the prices realized on the physical sale of the natural gas 
critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and which ultimately affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
however  the accounting principles used by the company generally do not impact the company s reported cash flows or liquidity 
generally  accounting rules do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve a selection of the appropriate policies for applying the basic principles 
interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to the company 
the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgments and estimates are crude oil and natural gas reserve estimation  site dismantlement and asset retirement obligations  impairment of assets  environmental remediation  derivative instruments  litigation  tax accruals  and benefit plans 
management s judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources  including engineers  legal counsel  actuaries  environmental studies and historical experience in similar matters 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates as additional information becomes known 
oil and gas reserves the estimates of oil and gas reserves are prepared by the company s geologists and engineers 
only proved oil and gas reserves are included in any financial statement disclosure 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
even though the company s geologists and engineers are knowledgeable and follow authoritative guidelines for estimating reserves  they must make a number of subjective assumptions based on professional judgments in developing the reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field 
revisions in the estimated reserves may be necessary due to a number of factors  including reservoir performance  new drilling  sales price and cost changes  technological advances  new geological or geophysical data  or other economic factors 
the company cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions 
depreciation rates are calculated using both reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties 
as the estimated reserves are adjusted  the depreciation expense for a property will change  assuming no change in production volumes or the costs capitalized 
estimated reserves may also be used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from a property  which are further used to analyze a property for potential impairment 
in addition  reserves are used to estimate the company s supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to its oil and gas producing activities 
changes in estimated reserves are considered changes in estimates for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis 
site dismantlement and asset retirement obligations the company has significant obligations for the dismantlement and removal of its oil and gas production and related facilities 
such costs have historically been accumulated over the estimated life of the facilities by use of the unit of production method 
accordingly  the rate of accumulation of such costs has been affected by changes in the underlying reserve estimates 
in addition  estimating future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments since most of the removal activities will occur several years in the future 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations that may ultimately impact the amount of the obligation 
in june  the fasb issued fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fas requires asset retirement costs to be capitalized as part of the cost of the related tangible long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the useful life of the asset 
the timing of implementation and the expected impact of this new standard are discussed below in the new accounting standards section 
successful efforts method of accounting the company has elected to use the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical costs  rentals  and exploratory dry holes  are charged against income as incurred 
costs of successful wells and related production equipment and developmental dry holes are capitalized and amortized by field using the unit of production method as oil and gas is produced 
the successful efforts method reflects the inherent volatility in exploring for and producing oil and gas 
the accounting method may yield significantly different operating results than the full cost method 
impairment of assets all long lived assets are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be greater than its future net cash flows 
the evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events  such as inflation rates  future sales prices for oil  gas or chemicals  future costs to produce these products  estimates of future oil and gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof  the economic and regulatory climates  and other factors 
the need to test a property for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices  unfavorable adjustments to oil and gas reserves  increases in operating costs  and changes in environmental or abandonment regulations 
assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when the company approves the plan to sell and thereafter while the asset is held for sale 
estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors  the company cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded 
derivative instruments the company is exposed to risk from fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates 
to reduce the impact of these risks on earnings and to increase the predictability of its cash flow  from time to time the company enters into certain derivative contracts  primarily swaps and collars for a portion of its oil and gas production  forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies  and interest rate swaps 
the company accounts for all its derivative instruments  including hedges  in accordance with fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the commodity  foreign currency and interest rate contracts are measured at fair value and recorded as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
when available  quoted market prices are used in determining fair value  however  if quoted market prices are not available  the company estimates fair value using either quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics or other valuation techniques 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are limited to creditworthy major institutions 
environmental remediation  litigation and other contingency reserves kerr mcgee management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation  litigation and other contingent matters 
provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental  legal or other contingent matters because of continually changing laws and regulations  inherent uncertainties associated with court and regulatory proceedings as well as cleanup requirements and related work  the possible existence of other potentially responsible parties  and the changing political and economic environment 
for these reasons  actual environmental  litigation and other contingency costs can vary significantly from the company s estimates 
for additional information about contingencies  refer to note tax accruals the company has operations in several countries around the world and is subject to income and other similar taxes in these countries 
the estimation of the amounts of income tax to be recorded by the company involves interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations  evaluation of tax audit findings  and assessment of how the foreign taxes affect domestic taxes 
although the company s management believes its tax accruals are adequate  differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters 
benefit plans the company provides defined benefit retirement plans and certain nonqualified benefits for employees in the us  us  germany and the netherlands and accounts for these plans in accordance with fas  employers accounting for pensions 
the various assumptions used and the attribution of the costs to periods of employee service are fundamental to the measurement of net periodic cost and pension obligations associated with the retirement plans 
one of the significant assumptions used to account for the company s pension plans is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in developing the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension cost  the company considers long term historical returns arithmetic average of the plan s investments  the asset allocation among types of investments  estimated long term returns by investment type from external sources  and the current economic environment 
based on this information the company selected for and for for us pension plans 
this decrease in the company s expected long term rate of return as of the beginning of is expected to increase net periodic pension cost by million but not affect expected contributions to fund the pension plans 
another significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate 
the company selects a discount rate as of december each year for us plans to reflect average rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments during december of that year 
the average moody s long term aa corporate bond yield for december is used as a guide in the selection of the discount rate for us pension plans 
for december  the average moody s long term aa corporate bond yield was  and the company chose as its discount rate at the end of for december  the average moody s long term aa corporate bond yield was  and the company chose as its discount rate at the end of this decrease in the discount rate effective december   is expected to increase net periodic pension cost by million but not affect expected contributions to fund the pension plans 
the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans 
the company determines this assumption based on its long term plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions 
based on this information  the company selected at december   and at december   for us pensions plans 
this decrease in assumed rate of compensation is expected to decrease net periodic pension cost by million but not affect expected contributions to fund pension plans 
the net effect the us pension plans had on results of operations for was million of income due to the expected return on assets exceeding other pension charges 
the total expected return on assets of the us pension plans for was million  compared with an actual loss of million 
during  the company s contributions to the retirement plans totaled million for certain us nonqualified plans and foreign plans 
when calculating expected return on plan assets for us pension plans  the company uses a market related value of assets that spreads asset gains and losses differences between actual return and expected return over five years 
as of january   the amount of unrecognized losses on us pension assets was million 
as these losses are recognized during future years in the market related value of assets  they will result in cumulative increases in net periodic pension cost of million in through a basis point increase decrease in the company s expected long term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of would decrease increase net periodic pension cost for us pension plans for by million 
the change would not affect expected contributions to fund the company s us pension plans 
the company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits and accounts for the related plans in accordance with fas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the postretirement benefit cost and obligation are also dependent on the company s assumptions used in the actuarially determined amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates discussed above  health care cost trends rates  inflation rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the above description of the company s critical accounting policies is not intended to be an all inclusive discussion of the uncertainties considered and estimates made by management in applying accounting principles and policies 
results may vary significantly if different policies were used or required and if new or different information becomes known to management 
environmental matters the company s affiliates are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the united states and in foreign countries in which they operate 
under these laws  the company s affiliates are or may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment due to the disposal or release of certain chemical  petroleum  low level radioactive and other substances at various sites 
environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent  and compliance costs are significant and will continue to be significant in the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that such laws and regulations or any environmental law or regulation enacted in the future will not have a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
sites at which the company s affiliates have environmental responsibilities include sites that have been designated as superfund sites by the us environmental protection agency epa pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of cercla  as amended  and that are included on the national priority list npl 
as of december   the company s affiliates had received notices that they had been named potentially responsible parties prp with respect to existing epa superfund sites on the npl that require remediation 
the company does not consider the number of sites for which its affiliates have been named a prp to be the determining factor when considering the company s overall environmental liability 
decommissioning and remediation obligations  and the attendant costs  vary substantially from site to site and depend on unique site characteristics and the regulatory requirements applicable to each site 
additionally  the company s affiliates may share liability at some sites with numerous other prps  and the law currently imposes joint and several liability on all prps under cercla 
the company s affiliates are also obligated to perform or have performed remediation or remedial investigations and feasibility studies at sites that have not been designated as superfund sites by epa 
such work is frequently undertaken pursuant to consent orders or other agreements 
current businesses the company s oil and gas affiliates are subject to numerous international  federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection 
in the united states  these include the federal water pollution control act  commonly known as the clean water act  the clean air act  the water pollution act and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
these laws and regulations govern  among other things  the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment  the issuance of permits in connection with exploration  drilling and production activities  the release of emissions into the atmosphere  and the discharge and disposition of waste materials 
environmental laws and regulations also govern offshore oil and gas operations  the implementation of spill prevention plans  the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites  and the remediation and monitoring of contaminated sites 
the company s chemical affiliates are subject to a broad array of international  federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection  including the clean water act  the clean air act  cercla and rcra 
these laws require the company s affiliates to undertake various activities to reduce air emissions  eliminate the generation of hazardous waste  decrease the volume of wastewater discharges and increase the efficiency of energy use 
discontinued businesses the company s affiliates historically have held interests in various businesses in which they are no longer engaged or which they intend to exit 
such businesses include the refining and marketing of oil and gas and associated petroleum products  the mining and processing of uranium and thorium  the production of ammonium perchlorate  and other activities 
additionally  the company announced in that its chemical affiliate would be exiting the forest products business by the end of although the company s affiliates are no longer engaged in certain businesses or have announced their intention to exit certain businesses  residual obligations may still exist  including obligations related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations  including the clean water act  the clean air act  cercla and rcra 
these laws and regulations require company affiliates to undertake remedial measures at sites of current or former operations or at sites where waste was disposed 
for example  company affiliates are required to conduct decommissioning and environmental remediation at certain refineries  distribution facilities and service stations they owned and or operated before exiting the refining and marketing business in company affiliates also are required to conduct decommissioning and remediation activities at sites where they were involved in the exploration  production  processing and or sale of uranium or thorium 
additionally  the company s chemical affiliate will be required to decommission and remediate its wood treatment facilities as part of its plan to exit the forest products business 
environmental costs expenditures for environmental protection and cleanup for each of the last three years and for the three year period ended december   are as follows millions of dollars total charges to environmental reserves recurring expenses capital expenditures total in addition to past expenditures  reserves have been established for the remediation and restoration of active and inactive sites where it is probable that future costs will be incurred and the liability is reasonably estimable 
for environmental sites  the company considers a variety of matters when setting reserves  including the stage of investigation  whether epa or another relevant agency has ordered action or quantified cost  whether the company has received an order to conduct work  whether the company participates as a prp in the remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs process and  if so  how far the ri fs has progressed  the status of the record of decision  the status of site characterization  the stage of the remedial design  evaluation of existing remediation technologies  and whether the company reasonably can evaluate costs based upon a remedial design and or engineering plan 
after the remediation work has begun  additional accruals or adjustments to costs may be made based on any number of developments  including revisions to the remedial design  unanticipated construction problems  identification of additional areas or volumes of contamination  inability to implement a planned engineering design or to use planned technologies and excavation methods  changes in costs of labor  equipment and or technology  any additional or updated engineering and other studies  and weather conditions 
as of december   the company s financial reserves for all active and inactive sites totaled million 
this includes million added in for active and inactive sites 
in the consolidated balance sheet  million of the total reserve is classified as a deferred credit  and the remaining million is included in current liabilities 
management believes that currently the company has reserved adequately for the reasonably estimable costs of known environmental contingencies 
however  additional reserves may be required in the future due to the previously noted uncertainties 
additionally  there may be other sites where the company has potential liability for environmental related matters but for which the company does not have sufficient information to determine that the liability is probable and or reasonably estimable 
the company has not established reserves for such sites 
the following table reflects the company s portion of the known estimated costs of investigation and or remediation that are probable and estimable 
the table summarizes epa superfund npl sites where the company and or its affiliates have been notified it is a prp under cercla and other sites for which the company had some ongoing financial involvement in investigation and or remediation at year end in the table  aggregated information is presented for certain sites that are individually not significant or for which there is insufficient information to estimate liability

sites specifically identified in the table above are discussed below 
west chicago  illinois in  the company s chemical affiliate chemical closed a facility in west chicago  illinois  that processed thorium ores for the federal government and for certain commercial purposes 
historical operations had resulted in low level radioactive contamination at the facility and in surrounding areas 
the original processing facility is regulated by the state of illinois the state  and four vicinity areas are designated as superfund sites on the npl 
closed facility in  chemical  the city of west chicago the city and the state reached agreement on the initial phase of the decommissioning plan for the closed west chicago facility  and chemical began shipping material from the site to a licensed permanent disposal facility 
in february  chemical executed an agreement with the city covering the terms and conditions for completing the final phase of decommissioning work 
the agreement requires chemical to excavate contaminated soil and ship it to a licensed disposal facility  monitor and  if necessary  remediate groundwater  and restore the property 
the state indicated approval of the agreement and issued license amendments authorizing the work 
chemical expects most of the work to be completed by the end of  leaving principally surface restoration and groundwater monitoring and or remediation for subsequent years 
surface restoration is expected to be completed in the long term scope  duration and cost of groundwater monitoring and or remediation are uncertain because it is not possible to reliably predict how groundwater conditions will be affected by the ongoing work 
vicinity areas epa has listed four areas in the vicinity of the closed west chicago facility on the npl and has designated chemical as a prp in these four areas 
epa issued unilateral administrative orders for two of the areas known as the residential areas and reed keppler park  which required chemical to conduct removal actions to excavate contaminated soil and ship the soil to a licensed disposal facility 
chemical has substantially completed the work required by the two orders 
the other two npl sites  known as kress creek and the sewage treatment plant  are contiguous and involve low levels of insoluble thorium residues principally in streambanks and streambed sediments  virtually all within a floodway 
chemical has conducted a thorough characterization of the two sites and has reached conceptual agreement with local governmental authorities on a cleanup plan  which is currently being reviewed by epa 
the cleanup plan will require excavation of contaminated soils and stream sediments  shipment of excavated materials to a licensed disposal facility  and restoration of affected areas 
the agreement is conditioned upon the resolution of certain matters  including agreements regarding potential natural resource damages and government response costs  and is expected to be incorporated in a consent decree that will address the outstanding issues 
the consent decree must be approved by epa  the state  local communities and chemical and then entered by a federal court 
it is expected that the necessary parties will approve the terms of a consent decree in and the work  once it begins  will take about four years to complete 
financial reserves as of december   the company had remaining reserves of million for costs related to west chicago 
this includes million added to the reserves in  of which million reflects the estimated costs to implement the conceptual agreement with respect to the kress creek and sewage treatment plant sites  and the remainder principally reflects changes in the scope of excavation and construction and increased estimates of the volumes of soil contamination at the other west chicago sites 
although actual costs may exceed current estimates  the amount of any increases cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the amount of the reserve has not been reduced by reimbursements expected from the federal government under title x discussed below 
government reimbursement pursuant to title x  the us department of energy doe is obligated to reimburse chemical for certain decommissioning and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the west chicago sites in recognition of the fact that about of the facility s production was dedicated to us government contracts 
the amount authorized for reimbursement under title x is million plus inflation adjustments 
that amount is expected to cover the government s full share of west chicago cleanup costs 
through december   chemical had been reimbursed approximately million under title x 
reimbursements under title x are provided by congressional appropriations 
historically  congressional appropriations have lagged chemical s cleanup expenditures 
as of december   the government s share of costs incurred by chemical but not yet reimbursed by the doe totaled approximately million 
the company believes receipt of this arrearage in due course following additional congressional appropriations is probable and has reflected the arrearage as a receivable in the financial statements 
the company will recognize recovery of the government s share of future remediation costs at the west chicago sites as chemical incurs the costs 
henderson  nevada in  chemical decided to exit the ammonium perchlorate business 
at that time  chemical curtailed operations and began preparation for the shutdown of associated production facilities in henderson  nevada  that produced ammonium perchlorate and other related products 
manufacture of perchlorate compounds began at henderson in in facilities owned by the us government 
production expanded significantly in with completion of a plant for manufacture of ammonium perchlorate 
the us navy paid for construction of this plant and took title to it in the navy continued to own the ammonium perchlorate plant as well as other associated production equipment at henderson until  when the plant was purchased by a predecessor of chemical 
the ammonium perchlorate produced at the henderson facility was used primarily in federal government defense and space programs 
perchlorate has been detected in nearby lake mead and the colorado river 
in  chemical decided to exit the business and began decommissioning the facility and remediating associated perchlorate  including surface impoundments and groundwater 
in and  chemical entered into consent orders with the nevada department of environmental protection that require chemical to implement both interim and long term remedial measures to capture and remove perchlorate from groundwater 
in  chemical initiated the interim measures required by the consent orders 
chemical subsequently developed and installed a long term remediation system based on new technology  but startup difficulties have prevented successful commissioning of the long term system 
chemical currently is evaluating possible solutions to resolve the startup difficulties and is also evaluating an alternative technology in the event the startup difficulties cannot be resolved 
the evaluation process should be completed in the first half of the interim system has been enhanced pending the successful commissioning of a long term system 
the scope and duration of groundwater remediation will be driven in the long term by drinking water standards  which to date have not been formally established by state or federal regulatory authorities 
epa and other federal and state agencies currently are evaluating the health and environmental risks associated with perchlorate as part of the process for ultimately setting a drinking water standard 
the resolution of these issues could materially affect the scope  duration and cost of the long term groundwater remediation that chemical is required to perform 
financial reserves as of december   the company s remaining reserves for henderson totaled million 
this includes million added in principally as a result of technological difficulties encountered with the long term remediation system and the resulting need to enhance and prolong the interim treatment measures 
the reserves do not include any cost that might be incurred to install an alternate technology as possible solutions to address the startup difficulties still are being evaluated  and evaluation of the alternate technology is not complete 
as noted above  the long term scope  duration and cost of groundwater remediation are uncertain and  therefore  additional costs may be incurred in the future 
however  the amount of any additions cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
government litigation in  chemical initiated litigation against the united states seeking contribution for response costs 
the government owned the plant in the early years of its operation and was the largest consumer of products produced at the plant 
the litigation is in the early stages of discovery 
although the outcome of the litigation is uncertain  chemical believes it is likely to recover a portion of its costs from the government 
the amount and timing of any recovery cannot be estimated at this time and  accordingly  the company has not recorded a receivable or otherwise reflected in the financial statements any potential recovery from the government 
insurance in  chemical purchased a year million  environmental cost cap insurance policy for groundwater remediation at henderson 
the insurance policy provides coverage only after chemical exhausts a self insured retention of approximately million and covers only those costs incurred to achieve a cleanup level specified in the policy 
as noted above  federal and state agencies have not established a drinking water standard and  therefore  it is possible that chemical may be required to achieve a cleanup level more stringent than that covered by the policy 
if so  the amount recoverable under the policy could be affected 
through december   chemical incurred expenditures of about million that it believes can be applied to the self insured retention 
additionally  the company believes that the million reserve remaining at december   will be creditable against the self insured retention 
the company has not recorded a receivable or otherwise reflected in the financial statements any potential recovery from the insurance policy since costs incurred to date and estimated costs for future work do not exhaust the self insured retention 
the applicability of expenditures to the self insured retention is a matter currently under discussion with the insurance carrier 
therefore  the amount of the remaining self insured retention may be greater than currently estimated 
milwaukee  wisconsin in  chemical closed a wood treatment facility it had operated in milwaukee  wisconsin 
operations at the facility prior to its closure had resulted in the contamination of soil and groundwater at and around the site with creosote and other substances used in the wood treatment process 
in  epa designated the milwaukee wood treatment facility as a superfund site under cercla  listed the site on the npl and named chemical a prp 
chemical executed a consent decree in that required it to perform soil and groundwater remediation at and below the former wood treatment area and to address a tributary creek of the menominee river that had become contaminated as a result of the wood treatment operations 
actual remedial activities were deferred until after the decree was finally entered in by a federal court in milwaukee 
groundwater treatment  using a pump and treat system  was initiated in to remediate groundwater contamination below and in the vicinity of the former wood treatment area 
it is not possible to reliably predict how groundwater conditions will be affected by the ongoing soil remediation and groundwater treatment 
therefore  it is not known how long groundwater treatment will continue 
soil cleanup of the former wood treatment area began in and was completed in also in  terms for addressing the tributary creek were agreed upon with epa  after which chemical began the implementation of a remedy to reroute the creek and to remediate associated sediment and stream bank soils 
it is expected that the soil and sediment remediation will take about four more years 
as of december   the company had remaining reserves of million for the costs of the remediation work described above 
this includes million added to the reserve in to implement the remedy related to the tributary creek 
although actual costs may exceed current estimates  the amount of any increases cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
cushing  oklahoma in  a company affiliate closed a petroleum refinery it had operated near cushing  oklahoma 
prior to being closed  the affiliate also had produced uranium and thorium fuel and metal at the site pursuant to licenses issued by the atomic energy commission aec 
the uranium and thorium operations commenced in and were shut down in  at which time the affiliate decommissioned and cleaned up the portion of the facility related to uranium and thorium operations to applicable standards 
when the refinery was closed in  it also was cleaned up to applicable standards 
subsequent regulatory changes required more extensive remediation at the site 
in  the affiliate entered into a consent agreement with the state of oklahoma to investigate the site and take appropriate remedial actions related to petroleum refining and uranium and thorium residuals 
remediation of hydrocarbon contamination is being performed under a plan approved by the oklahoma department of environmental quality 
soil remediation to address hydrocarbon contamination is expected to continue for about four more years 
the scope of any groundwater remediation that may be required is not known 
additionally  in  the affiliate received a decommissioning license from the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  the successor to aec s licensing authority  to clean up certain uranium and thorium residuals 
to avoid anticipated future increases in disposal costs  much of the uranium and thorium residuals were cleaned up and disposed of in after obtaining nrc approvals to conduct soil removal without first completing the site characterization  work that is necessary for identifying the scope of required cleanup activities 
because excavation preceded characterization  contamination that had not been previously identified was encountered and removed during the expedited excavation and disposal work 
characterization and verification work is ongoing to confirm whether the work undertaken in adequately addressed the contaminated areas 
additional excavation may be required in the future depending on the results of the characterization and verification work 
as of december   the company had remaining reserves of million for the costs of the ongoing remediation and decommissioning work described above 
this included million added to the reserves in principally as a result of costs incurred to perform the expedited uranium and thorium cleanup work and costs for excavating and disposing of additional refinery related wastes identified in although actual costs may exceed current estimates  the amount of any increases cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company adopted the provisions of fas as of january   for all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of that date 
under fas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are instead reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
the nonamortization provisions of this standard were immediately applicable for any goodwill acquired after june   which included goodwill associated with the august   acquisition of hs resources  inc separately identifiable intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company completed its required annual test for impairment as of june   with no impairment loss being indicated 
in august  the fasb issued fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
fas supersedes fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the portion of accounting principles board opinion no 
that deals with disposal of a business segment 
the new standard resolves significant implementation issues related to fas and establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
the company adopted fas as of january   and  in accordance with the standard  has classified certain asset disposal groups whose operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the company as discontinued operations 
prior year amounts in the company s consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheet and related disclosures have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation 
see note for further discussion 
in june  the fasb issued fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fas requires that an asset retirement obligation aro associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset be recognized as a liability in the period in which it is incurred as defined  with an offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the associated asset 
the cost of the tangible asset  including the initially recognized aro  is depreciated such that the cost of the aro is recognized over the useful life of the asset 
the aro is recorded at fair value  and accretion expense will be recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value 
the fair value of the aro is measured using expected future cash outflows discounted at the company s credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
the company was required to adopt fas on january  as a result  kerr mcgee will accrue an abandonment liability associated with its oil and gas wells and platforms when those assets are placed in service  rather than its past practice of accruing the expected abandonment costs on a unit of production basis over the productive life of the associated oil and gas field 
additionally  the company will accrue an abandonment liability associated with its plans to decommission the mobile  alabama  synthetic rutile plant 
the company recorded an after tax charge to earnings of approximately million on january   to recognize the cumulative effect of retroactively applying the new accounting principle 
in addition  beginning in  the company will record accretion expense for its aro liabilities and additional depreciation expense on the associated assets 
the new accounting principle is not expected to have a significant effect on income from continuing operations 
in june  the fasb issued fas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
fas nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the new standard requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  in contrast to the previous guidance set forth in eitf issue no 
 which required accrual of such costs at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
fas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  adoption of the new standard will impact the timing of liability recognition but will not have a material effect on the company s ultimate costs associated with future exit or disposal activities 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
for certain guarantees  fin requires recognition at the inception of a guarantee of a liability for the fair value of the obligation assumed in issuing the guarantee 
fin also requires expanded disclosures for outstanding guarantees  even if the likelihood of the guarantor having to make any payments under the guarantee is considered remote 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for guarantees outstanding as of december   however  the recognition provisions are to be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company does not expect the implementation of this new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation clarifies the application of arb  consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
because application of the majority voting interest requirement in arb may not identify the party with a controlling financial interest in situations where controlling financial interest is achieved through arrangements not involving voting interests  this interpretation introduces the concept of variable interests and requires consolidation by an enterprise having variable interests in a previously unconsolidated entity if the enterprise is considered the primary beneficiary  meaning the enterprise will absorb a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses or residual returns 
for variable interest entities in existence as of february   fin requires consolidation by the primary beneficiary in the interim period beginning after june  in accordance with the provisions of fin  the company believes it is reasonably likely that it will be required to consolidate the business trust created to construct and finance the gunnison production platform 
the construction is being financed via a synthetic lease credit facility between the trust and groups of financial institutions for up to million  with the company making lease payments sufficient to pay interest on the financing 
if required  consolidation of the financing trust will occur in the period beginning july   and the trust is expected to remain subject to consolidation through december  completion of the gunnison platform is expected to occur in the first quarter of  at which time the gunnison synthetic lease will be converted to an operating lease and a different trust will become the lessor owner of the platform and related equipment and will no longer be subject to consolidation 
the company continues to review the effects of fin relative to the company s other variable interest entities  such as the nansen and boomvang operating leases
