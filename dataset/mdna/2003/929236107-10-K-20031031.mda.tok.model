item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations year ended august  compared with the year ended august  net sales were million in fiscal year  an increase of from net sales of million in the prior year 
the company had sales of products within three primary categories lubricants  hand cleaners and household products 
lubricants include the wd and in one brands  hand cleaners include the lava and solvol brands  and the household products category includes the carpet fresh  flushes  x  and spot shot brands 
the overall increase in sales in the current year compared to last year is due to an increase in household product and lubricant sales  offset by a decrease in hand cleaner sales 
household products sales were million in the current year compared to million in the prior year  a increase 
lubricant sales for the year were million  up from million in the prior year period 
hand cleaner sales were million  down by from million 
sales by region for the current and prior year were as follows in millions year ended august  americas europe asia pacific total in the americas region  sales for fiscal year were up over the prior year 
compared to the prior year  household products increased million  or  lubricant sales were up million  or  and hand cleaner sales decreased million  or 
household product sales in fiscal year were up compared to the prior year period due to sales from the spot shot brand in the us and canada 
the spot shot brand was acquired through acquisition of the heartland corporation on may  excluding spot shot  household product sales were down million or from the prior year 
this decrease is due to weakness in the us economy  combined with competitive factors within and among product categories for shelf space 
the uncertainty in the us economy during most of the year influenced the purchasing decisions of retailers who reacted by reducing inventories and promotional buying 
the company is as much affected by the reactions of its direct customers to changes in the economy  as it is by the purchasing decisions of end users of its products 
category shelf space continually expands and contracts with the introduction of new products in both related and unrelated categories 
the categories where the company s household product brands compete have experienced competitive pressure from a variety of new product introductions in both related and unrelated categories 
this has resulted in reduced shelf space allocation for the company s household product categories as a whole 
the automatic toilet bowl category has experienced these pressures on shelf space from new product introductions in related categories  which have reduced sales and the range of products within the company s category 
in spite of the overall category weakness  the company s share of category sales has grown 
pressures from related categories have also had an effect on rug and room deodorizers 
retailers have cut back shelf space for traditional rug and room deodorizers and have reallocated space to other air care products 
as a result  the rug and room deodorizer category as a whole has declined 
although sales of the carpet fresh brand have declined  the brand has increased market segment share 
the x hard surface cleaners have been affected by competitive product introductions within their categories  as two strong competitors have been introduced into the mildew stain remover category  which has negatively impacted x s market share within the category 
with the exception of the hard surface cleaners  the company s household product brands have continued to build market share 
the company has plans to address the challenges and opportunities that exist within each of its household product categories with product and or promotional innovation 
the increase in lubricant sales in the americas in fiscal year is mainly related to growth of wd sales in the us and canada 
the increase in lubricant sales in the us is due to the benefit in fiscal year sales from promotions surrounding the company s th anniversary  along with the introduction of the new in one oil professional line products  which began shipping into the us market towards the end of february of fiscal year the professional line of products include a spray and drip penetrant  a white lithium grease spray  and a silicone spray 
this line has been well received and is expected to be a contributor to the growth of the in one oil brand in the future 
the line began shipments to the asian and australian markets in the third quarter of fiscal  and into the uk  spain and france towards the end of the fiscal year 
lubricant sales in canada were up  of which was due to the benefits of foreign exchange and related to accounts specific promotions run for two major customers in the current year 
latin america wd sales were down from the prior year  due to economic conditions in areas of latin america 
sales of heavy duty hand cleaners for the americas decreased to million  down from million in the prior year 
the decrease in the americas hand cleaner sales is primarily attributable to the us market 
the prior year period sales had a special one time promotional program at a large retailer to gain and support new distribution  which was not duplicated in the current year 
additionally  sales for the lava liquid have not kept pace with the prior year due to recent losses in distribution 
until distribution is expanded  we expect the lower sales levels to continue 
for this region  of sales in fiscal year came from the us  and from canada and latin america 
this distribution is consistent with that of fiscal year european sales in fiscal year were from lubricants  and from hand cleaners  consistent with fiscal year current year sales in europe grew to million  up million  or over sales in fiscal year favorable exchange rates accounted for of the growth  and the other was due to strong performances across the region 
increases in sales in us dollars across the various parts of the region over the prior year quarter are as follows the uk   france   germany   spain   italy   and in the countries in which the company sells through local distributors  
the uk sales are up over the prior year in u 
s dollars primarily due to the benefits of foreign exchange rates  as sales in sterling are down over the prior year 
the growth in france  germany  spain  and italy is a result of expanded distribution in all trade channels 
benefits from foreign exchange accounted for of the growth in distributor markets over fiscal year the principal continental european countries where the company sells through a direct sales force  spain  italy  france and germany  together accounted for of the region s sales for the current year  up from in the prior year period 
in the long term  these countries are expected to continue to be important contributors to the region s growth 
the distributor team produced excellent results in eastern europe and the middle east 
europe direct markets also experienced growth through the fiscal year  with the exception of the uk where sales were affected by poor sales leadership  along with poor lava results 
the company has decided to discontinue its efforts with the lava brand in europe 
there has been a restructuring of the uk sales team  and the brand awareness of the wd brand has strengthened in the uk through the use of a well known television personality in a marketing campaign 
in fiscal year the company plans to establish direct sales presence in the dutch market  formerly sales were through local distributors 
eastern europe has historically shown solid growth over the last few years  which is expected to continue into next fiscal year 
in the asia pacific region  total sales were up over last year 
asia had a increase in sales  up to million from million in the prior year period  resulting from growth of the wd brand 
this increase is attributable to growth in china where the company s marketing distributor has worked to gain additional distribution in all markets 
the company continues to combat counterfeit products  which remain an issue within the asian market  particularly in china 
australia sales for the year were up over fiscal year  with increases in sales of all brands in us dollars 
foreign exchange accounted for of the growth in australian sales over the prior year 
without the benefits of foreign exchange  lubricant sales were down over the prior year and hand cleaner sales had continued growth 
this decrease in lubricant sales is due to the timing of a promotion recorded in last year s sales and not repeated in this financial year 
the company is encouraged by the release this year of several new brands into the asia pacific region including spot shot  carpet fresh no vac and in one professional 
these brands are expected to provide growth across the region in the coming fiscal year  while wd and solvol provide a stable base 
the company is pleased with the strong sales in the asia pacific region in fiscal year  but expects trading conditions to remain variable with modest growth in the fiscal year 
gross profit was million  or of sales in the fiscal year  compared to million  or of sales in the fiscal year 
the gross margin increase of is primarily due to the effect of promotional costs and the mix of products sold 
the overall impact of promotional costs on gross margin percentage was in the current period compared to in the prior year  a change of 
changes in product mix resulted in a increase in gross margin percentage 
the write down of lava towel inventory in the uk during the prior year decreased last year s gross margin percentage by 
the timing of certain promotional activities and shifts in product mix may continue to cause significant fluctuations in gross margin from period to period

freight costs increased by million  along with commissions of million  both associated with the increase in sales 
professional fees and insurance costs increased by million in total  which includes a million increase in legal fees  million in accounting and other professional fees  and a million increase in insurance costs 
professional and legal fees have both increased primarily as a result of the new regulatory environment 
the increase in insurance costs for the company is consistent with the increases experienced by the general market 
corporate insurance costs have been driven up across the board for a variety of economic and political reasons 
research and development increased by million and other miscellaneous costs increased by million 
these increases were offset by decreases in bad debt expense by million and general employee costs by million 
the decrease in general employee expenses relate to the reallocation of employees to the research and development effort and the creation of team tomorrow  a newly developed department in fiscal year whose focus is on the future of our company and our brands 
the investment in research and development is up over the prior year due to this reallocation of employees in addition to increased product exploration and direct research and development costs 
bad debt is down due to reduction in defaults by our customers 
as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased to for the year  down from last year 
although costs not directly related to sales  such as legal costs  insurance and professional fees  are increased over the prior year period  they increased at a lower rate than sales 
advertising and sales promotion expense increased to million for the current year from million last year  and as a percentage of sales  increased to  up from in the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  advertising and sales promotion expense may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities employed by the company  as the cost of certain promotional activities are required to be recorded as reductions to sales  and others remain in advertising and sales promotion expense 
investment in global advertising and sales promotional expenses for fiscal year is expected to be in the range of of net sales 
the company recorded a million loss on the write off of a non compete agreement with a former independent sales representative  as the business to which the agreement relates is not likely to continue 
accordingly  the remaining million book value of this asset was determined to be impaired and was written off during the second quarter of fiscal year amortization expense was million for the fiscal year  down from million in the prior year 
this amortization expense represents the amortization of a non compete agreement

the increase in both income from operations  and income from operations as a percentage of sales  was due to the items discussed above

the change in interest expense  net is due to the interest expense incurred as a result of the borrowings associated with the heartland acquisition 
the prior year period included a million write off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the early extinguishment of long term debt 
this expense has been reclassified to other expense from an extraordinary item for comparative presentation in accordance with sfas no 
 rescission of sfas nos 
  and  amendment of sfas no 
 and technical corrections 
other income  net was million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in other income was primarily due to the effect of foreign exchange transactions  which produced gains of  in the current year compared to losses of  in the prior year

household product sales were million in the current year compared to million in the prior year 
the prior year included only four months of household product sales subsequent to the acquisition of global household brands in april  and the current year had increased household product sales as a result of the acquisition of the spot shot brand in may the reported results reflect the adoption of eitf issue accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
the application of this guidance has no effect on net income  but reclassifies certain marketing and promotional expenses from operating expenses to a reduction in sales 
the related marketing and promotional expenses that are now being recorded as reductions in sales include  coupons  consideration and allowances given to retailers for space in their stores slotting fees  consideration and allowances given to obtain favorable display positions in the retailer s stores  co operative advertising and other promotional activity 
this reclassification reduced both net sales and advertising and sales promotion expense during the year ended august  by million and by million during the prior year

this increase is also due to the household product sales  which are currently only sold in the americas 
sales of the household products increased significantly over the prior year  million in fiscal versus million in the prior year 
most of the increase is due to the fact that the prior year included only four months of sales after the acquisition of global household brands on april  in addition  fiscal added million in sales of spot shot during the last three months of the year  after the acquisition of heartland on may  the region s lubricant sales decreased by million or  but were partially offset by an increase in hand cleaner sales of million or 
the decrease in lubricant sales in the americas is principally a result of the decrease in wd sales  which is primarily due to the company s decision to discontinue the wd bonus ounce promotion that offered of free product in each can

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of its business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in the market value of its investments 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
accordingly  the company s uk subsidiary utilizes forward contracts to limit its exposure on converting cash balances maintained in euros into british sterling 
the company regularly monitors its foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
while the company engages in foreign currency hedging activity to reduce its risk  for accounting purposes  none of the foreign exchange contracts are designated as hedges 
interest rate risk at august   the entire balance of the company s outstanding borrowings of million were variable interest rate loans and subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
on october   the company replaced million of the variable rate loans with a new year fixed rate loan  and obtained a new million fixed rate term loan in may the change has significantly reduced the company s exposure to interest rate risk  since only the million revolving line of credit is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
as of august   there was no balance outstanding under the revolving line of credit  with variable interest rate based on the libor rate plus 
the company s interest rate risk on the outstanding line of credit balance is based upon the fluctuation in the libor rate 
any significant increase in the libor rate could have a material effect on interest expense incurred on any borrowings outstanding on the line of credit 
other risk factors component supply risk the company depends upon its suppliers for the supply of the primary components for its wd brand and other products 
such components are subject to significant price volatility beyond the control or influence of the company 
petroleum products  of which wd and in one are comprised  have had significant price volatility in the past  and may in the future 
rising oil prices can also impact the company s cost of transporting its products 
the company has historically been successful in managing its component costs and product pricing to maintain historical gross margins 
additionally  the company has generally found alternate sources of constituent chemicals for its products readily available 
as component and raw material costs are the main contribution to cost of goods sold for all of the company s products  any significant fluctuation in the costs of components could also have a material impact on the gross margins realized on the company s products 
specifically  future can prices are exposed to fluctuation resulting from tariffs on steel  therefore any significant increase or decrease in the steel tariffs could have a significant impact on the costs of purchasing cans and the company s cost of goods 
in the event there is more significant price volatility or higher component costs generally  the company may not be able to maintain  or may choose not to maintain  its gross margins by raising its product prices without affecting demand and unit sales 
increases in the prices for the components could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
reliance on supply chain the company s contract manufacturers rely upon two key vendors for the supply of empty cans used in the production of wd  carpet fresh  in one  and spot shot products 
additionally  the company relies on single manufacturers for the production of flushes and x automatic toilet bowl cleaners  x liquid cleaners  carpet fresh powder and its lava bar soap 
the loss of any of these suppliers or manufacturers could temporarily disrupt or interrupt the production of the company s products 
the company does not have direct control over the management or business of the primary contract manufacturers utilized in the manufacturing of the company s products  except indirectly through terms as negotiated in contracts with those manufacturers 
should the terms of doing business with the company s primary contract manufacturers change  the company s cost structure may be impacted  which could have a direct impact on the company s profit margins 
competition the market for the company s products is highly competitive and is expected to be increasingly competitive in the future 
the company s products compete both within their own product classes as well as within product distribution channels  competing with many other products for store placement and shelf space 
competition in international markets varies by country 
the company is aware of many competing products  some of which sell for lower prices  however  the company relies on the awareness of its brands among consumers  the value offered by those brands as perceived by consumers  and its unique platform of multiple distribution channels as its primary competitive strategies 
these considerations as well as increased competition generally could result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  and a loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
in addition  many of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not materially adversely affect its business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
political and economic risks the company s domestic and international operations are exposed to the risk of political and economic uncertainties 
changes in political and economic conditions may affect product cost  availability  distribution  pricing  purchasing  and consumption patterns 
while the company seeks to manage its business in consideration of these risks  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
as the company s sales extend to various countries around the globe  financial results in affected areas are exposed to a higher degree of risk 
examples of regions currently exposed to such types of risk include latin america  the middle east  and parts of asia 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully mitigate against current and future risk associated with political and economic uncertainties  or that the risks faced by the company will not materially adversely affect its business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
as sales grow within various regions around the world  the company s exposure to this risk will increase 
business risks with the trend toward consolidation in the retail marketplace  the company s customer base is shifting toward fewer  but larger  customers who purchase in larger volumes 
a large percentage of the company s sales are to mass retail customers 
sales to one of these customers accounted for approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal year the spot shot brand is presently sold to two major customers 
each customer accounts for or more of its spot shot sales 
the loss of  or reduction in  orders from  any of the company s most significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its financial results 
large customers also seek price reductions  added support  or promotional concessions 
to support this trend  the company has had to expand its use of customer and market specific promotions and allowances  which has negatively impacted and will continue to impact  the company s ability to maintain existing profit margins 
in addition  the company is subject to changes in customer purchasing patterns 
these types of changes may result from changes in the manner in which customers purchase and manage inventory levels  or display and promote products within their stores 
other potential factors such as customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters may also impact operating results 
operating results and net earnings may not meet expectations the company cannot be sure that its operating results and net earnings will meet its expectations 
if the company s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition  or if the company does not achieve all of its key goals  then the company s actual performance could vary materially from its expectations 
the company s operating results and net earnings may be influenced by a number of factors  including the following the introduction of new products and line extensions by the company or its competitors  the company s ability to control its internal costs and the cost of raw materials  the effectiveness of the company s advertising  marketing and promotional programs  changes in product pricing policies by the company or its competitors  changes of accounting policies  the ability of the company to achieve business plans  including volume growth and pricing plans  despite high levels of competitive activity  the ability to maintain key customer relationships  the ability of major customers and other creditors to meet their obligations as they come due  the ability to successfully manage regulatory  tax and legal matters  including resolution of pending matters within current estimates  the ability of the company to attract and retain qualified personnel  expenses for impairment of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets and equity investments in excess of projections  regulatory risks the company is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on its business operations  including among other things  the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the handling  use  treatment  storage and clean up of solid and hazardous wastes  and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances 
such laws and regulations may otherwise relate to various health and safety matters that impose burdens upon the company s operations 
these laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects and also require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous wastes 
these laws and regulations also impose strict  retroactive and joint and several liability for the costs of  and damages resulting from  cleaning up current sites  past spills  disposals and other releases of hazardous substances 
the company believes that its expenditures related to environmental matters have not had  and are not currently expected to have  a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  the environmental laws under which the company operates are complicated and often increasingly more stringent  and may be applied retroactively 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to make additional expenditures to remain in or to achieve compliance with environmental laws in the future or that any such additional expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
some of the company s products have chemical compositions that are controlled by various state  federal and international laws and regulations 
the company complies with these laws and regulations and seeks to anticipate developments that could impact the company s ability to continue to produce and market its products 
the company invests in research and development to maintain product formulations that comply with such laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to alter the chemical composition of one or more of the company s products in such a way that will not have an adverse effect upon the product s efficacy or marketability 
a delay or other inability of the company to complete product research and development in response to any such regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
a focus on environmental regulations relating to volatile organic compounds voc s resulted in a change in the formulation of the wd product in the majority of countries where the product is sold  whereby co was chosen as the aerosol propellant in as a result of this change  the cost of manufacturing wd was increased and the company increased its selling prices to partially offset the additional cost 
in the event of future increases in product cost  the company may not be in a position to raise selling prices  and therefore an increase in costs could have an adverse effect on the company s profitability 
voc s are regulated by the california air resources board carb 
current carb regulations required a reformulation of the companies multi purpose lubricants 
on november   the company obtained approval for variance with regulations relating to the voc content in its multipurpose lubricants from the carb 
the variance gives the company an extension of one year to research and develop effective formulas with lower voc content for its multipurpose lubricants 
the company has successfully reformulated its multipurpose lubricants to be in full compliance with carb regulation 
the reformulation has resulted in increased product costs 
in conjunction with the review of the state budget  california recently gave carb the approval to enforce a fee based system which would allow it to collect fees from those it governs on the voc issues 
these fees will go into carb s operating budget and help cover shortfalls  and are said to be based on the amount of voc s a company s product puts into the state s atmosphere 
if a similar voc policy is adopted by other states  the potential impact of fees charged could be material to the company 
generally  the manufacture  packaging  storage  distribution and labeling of the company s products and the company s business operations all must comply with extensive federal  state  and foreign laws and regulations 
it is possible that the government will increase regulation of the transportation  storage or use of certain chemicals  to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and that such regulation could negatively impact raw material supply or costs 
success of acquisitions the company has recently acquired the household product brands spot shot  flushes  x  and carpet fresh 
the company believes that its recent acquisitions provide opportunities for growth for all of the company s brands as well as increased efficiencies and cost savings in management  operations and marketing 
however  if the company is not able to successfully integrate acquired products  the company may not be able to maximize these opportunities 
rather  the failure to integrate these acquired businesses because of difficulties in the assimilation of operations and products  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the loss of key employees or other factors  could materially adversely affect the company s financial results 
one of the company s strategies is to increase its sales volumes  earnings and the markets it serves through acquisitions of other businesses in the united states and internationally 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  acquire  or profitably manage additional companies or operations or that it will be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions into its operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that companies or operations acquired will be profitable at their inception or that they will achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made 
increased use of debt financing the company has historically paid out a large part of its earnings to stockholders in the form of regular quarterly dividends 
the recent acquisitions have been funded to a large extent by new debt 
in order to service the new debt  the company will be required to use its income from operations to make interest and principal payments required by the terms of the loan documents 
in addition  the company is required by covenants within the loan documents to maintain certain financial ratios and compliance with other financial terms 
the company believes that the increased income from operations derived from the acquired businesses will fully cover the new debt service requirements 
in the past two years  the company has announced reductions to its regular quarterly dividend from to per share in april and from to per share in july reducing the annual dividend since april from to 
in order to make more of its cash flow available for debt service requirements 
however  if operating income is not sufficient to properly service the debt or otherwise allow the company to maintain compliance with the terms of its loans  the company could be required to seek additional financing through the issuance of more debt or the sale of equity securities  or the company might be required to further reduce dividends 
the increased debt service obligations could result in lower earnings for the company if anticipated gross and net margins are not maintained for the company s new and existing business lines 
protection of intellectual property the company relies on trademark  trade secret  patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property 
the company cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be successfully asserted in the future or that they will not be invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  laws of some of the foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be sold do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the failure of the company to protect its proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against the company could make it less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company frequently defends its brands from counterfeits across asia through legal and enforcement actions 
in addition  the company has introduced uniquely shaped packaging that the company believes will reduce the ability of counterfeits to imitate the company s products 
volatility in the insurance market the company re evaluates its insurance coverage annually 
trends in the insurance industry suggest that such contracts may be much more expensive  less protective or even unavailable 
in such a case the company may decide to increase levels of self insurance  thereby undertaking additional risk 
product liability and other litigation risks the use of the company s products may expose the company to liability claims resulting from such use 
the company maintains product liability insurance that it believes will be adequate to protect the company from material loss attributable to such claims but the extent of such loss could exceed available limits of insurance or could arise out of circumstances under which such insurance coverage would be unavailable 
other business activities of the company may also expose the company to litigation risks  including risks that may not be covered by insurance 
if successful claims are asserted by third parties against the company for uninsured liabilities or liabilities in excess of applicable insured limits of coverage  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
marketing distributor relationships the company distributes its products throughout the world in one of two ways the direct distribution model  where products are sold directly by the company to wholesalers and retailers in the us  us  canada  australia and a number of other countries  and the marketing distributor model  where products are sold to exclusive marketing distributors who in turn sell to wholesalers and retailers 
a marketing distributor represents the company in its particular market and works with the company to develop and implement plans to increase brand awareness and distribution 
in many countries throughout the world  the marketing distributor model provides the company with a representative who has extensive local market knowledge 
the company relies on the efforts and knowledge of its marketing distributors to successfully achieve the optimal level of penetration for its brands in each market 
from time to time  the company has experienced changes with respect to its marketing distributor relationships 
there is a risk that changes in such marketing distributor relationships that are not managed successfully could result in a disruption in one or more of the affected markets and that such disruption could have an adverse material effect on the company s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows
