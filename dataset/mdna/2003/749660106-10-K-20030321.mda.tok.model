item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
see also forward looking statements on page critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  trends in the industry  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may not be collected in the future 
substantially all of the company s receivables are due from oil and gas exploration and production companies in the united states  selected international locations and foreign national owned oil companies 
we have established credit evaluation procedures that seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers 
our customers ability to pay is directly related to their ability to generate cash flow on their projects and is significantly affected by the volatility in the price of oil and natural gas 
the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s evaluation of the overall trends in the oil and gas industry  financial condition of our customers  our historical collection experience  and in the case of foreign customers  our judgments about the economic and political environment of the related country and region 
we have favorable collections experience with most of our customers except for certain companies owned by foreign governments that tend to extend their payments 
income taxes the determination of our income tax provision is complex due to operations in several tax jurisdictions outside the united states which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
tax regimes in certain jurisdictions are subject to significant changes  which may be applied on a retroactive basis 
if this were to occur  our tax expense could be materially different than the amounts reported 
furthermore  in determining the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets  we estimate taxable income into the future and determine the magnitude of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized 
accrued insurance liabilities the company has exposure to various contingent liabilities and future claims 
the company self insures  up to specified limits  certain risks related to general liability  workers compensation  vehicle and equipment liability  and employee health insurance plan costs 
the cost of claims under these self insurance programs are estimated and accrued as the claims are incurred although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods 
these claims are monitored and the cost estimates are revised as developments occur relating to such claims 
to estimate the ultimate cost of the claims  the company applies loss development factors to its outstanding claims and uses its experience  and where appropriate  the advice of outside counsel or other experts 
the non current portion of these estimated outstanding claims is classified as long term accrued insurance expenses 
upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  our future financial results will be impacted by the difference between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle the liability 
depreciable life of assets the selection of the useful lives of many of the assets require the judgment of our personnel to estimate the length of their useful lives 
to the extent that the estimate differs from the actual life of the assets  our future financial results could be impacted by any changes to the depreciable lives 
we believe the current estimates of the useful lives are reasonable 
pension liabilities pension costs are actuarially determined and affected by assumptions including the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets and other factors 
the company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
the company utilizes the moody s aa long term corporate bond yield as a basis for determining the discount rate with a yield adjustment made for the longer duration of the company s obligations 
the company evaluates its assumption regarding the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets based on the historical experience and future expectation on investment returns 
the company chooses a rate of return on plan assets that it believes is an appropriate long term average return 
the expected return on plan assets takes into account estimated future investment returns for various asset classes held in the plans portfolio 
to the extent changes are required in the assumptions discussed above  the company s recorded liabilities may have to be adjusted and may result in material impact to the results of operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
rpc generated revenues of  in compared to  in  a decrease of  or percent 
revenues decreased as a result of weak drilling activity domestically and the shut down of operations in algeria and venezuela early in the second quarter  which were previously our largest international operations 
the assets and personnel involved in these operations related to both the technical and support services business segments and were re deployed to the extent possible in our domestic market areas 
the domestic rig count continued the decline begun in the fourth quarter of and hit a low of early in the second quarter of the average domestic rig count was in compared to  in  a percent decrease 
although oil prices increased percent from the first quarter to the fourth quarter and natural gas prices rose percent during the same period  the rise in commodity prices failed to lead to a significant increase in drilling activity during the year 
some of the factors causing this continued depressed activity during were us domestic economic weakness  global political uncertainty  and a warmer than average winter 
cost of services rendered and goods sold 
cost of services rendered and goods sold were  in compared to  in  a percent decrease 
this decrease was due to lower customer activity levels and rpc s cost reduction efforts 
cost of services rendered and goods sold increased from percent of revenues in to percent in this percentage increase resulted from lower utilization of equipment and personnel during the period and because of the fixed nature of many of these expenses 
the rate of decline in cost of services rendered and goods sold was lower than the corresponding rate of decline in revenues  because of weaker industry conditions  resulting in significantly lower pricing for our services 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing throughout  the company made efforts to reduce its costs of providing services including reducing its employee headcount 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  in compared to  in this decrease of  or percent  was primarily the result of decreased employment costs from expense reduction efforts prompted by reduced revenues and reduction in activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased from percent in to percent in the decrease also resulted from the elimination of several small non oilfield business units which did not incur expenses during selling  general and administrative expenses also declined as a result of the shut down of our operations in algeria and venezuela and the deployment of those resources to lower cost operating environments 
however  the rate of decline in selling  general and administrative expenses was lower than the rate of decline in revenues due to the fixed nature of many of these expenses 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization were  in  an increase of  or percent compared to  in the increase in depreciation and amortization resulted from the cumulative effect of the higher levels of growth capital expenditures made during the past few years  offset slightly by relatively lower capital expenditures during and the cessation of goodwill amortization 
beginning in  rpc ceased amortizing goodwill pursuant to sfas in  the amortization of goodwill was approximately  operating profit loss 
operating loss was  in  a decrease of  compared to an operating profit of  in this significant decline in operating profit resulted from an overall weakening in industry conditions  offset somewhat by rpc s cost reduction efforts  as discussed above 
interest expense income  net 
interest expense was  in compared to  in rpc s interest expense relates to notes payable to the former owners of its acquired businesses  and is offset by interest income from investment of its available cash 
rpc s available cash is invested in short term marketable debt securities

income from discontinued operation net of income taxes 
rpc realized no income or loss from discontinued operations in  compared to net income from discontinued operations of  in this decrease is due to the spin off of rpc s powerboat manufacturing segment in february  which was classified as a discontinued operation during year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues

revenues increased as a result of improvements in overall customer activity levels domestically and internationally  as the average domestic rig count was  during the first three quarters of compared to  at the end of also contributing to the strength of reported revenues was the addition of new equipment through asset purchases and acquisitions of businesses 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  the domestic rig count experienced its second steepest quarterly decline since at the end of the fourth quarter of  the number of active drilling rigs in the united states was approximately percent lower than its july peak 
other factors that contributed to the decreased revenues in the fourth quarter of were the lower price for natural gas  terrorism and the war in afghanistan  economic recession  and political instability in venezuela 
the demand for our services decreased in the fourth quarter of as many energy companies responded to the lower prices for oil and natural gas by curtailing their capital expenditures 
cost of services rendered and goods sold

the decrease in interest income results primarily from a decrease in average investable cash balances 
income tax provision benefit 
the effective income tax rate in of percent was the same in income loss from continuing operations net of income taxes 
rpc s income from continuing operations was  an increase of  or percent compared to  in this improvement is consistent with the increases in operating profit  as the income tax rate was the same in both periods 
income from discontinued operation net of income taxes 
rpc s powerboat manufacturing segment  classified as a discontinued operation  earned  in compared to  in this decrease was due primarily to the fact that the discontinued operation was included in rpc s consolidated financial results for the first two months of prior to its spin off  compared to being included for the full year of liquidity and capital resources in february  the company spun off its powerboat manufacturing segment in a tax free spin off 
historically  the powerboat manufacturing segment generated more cash than it needed to fund its operations and the excess was transferred to rpc 
subsequent to the spin off  any excess cash generated by the spun off segment is no longer available to the company 
the company s decisions about the amount of cash to be used for investing and financing purposes are influenced by our capital position and the amount of cash expected to be provided by operations 
the company s liquidity requirements are used to fund expansion of our working capital as business activity levels increase  to fund growth and maintenance capital expenditures and to fund acquisitions of other businesses 
in addition  the company uses its liquidity to pay dividends to its common stockholders and to repurchase common stock on the open market 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided from operations and debt provided by sellers of acquired businesses  supplemented where needed  by access to a million credit facility with a financial institution encompassing letters of credit and a demand note 
the credit facility is renewable annually with interest payable monthly on outstanding advances under the demand note generally at libor plus basis points 
generally we have not maintained balances under this bank note for extended periods of time 
unless we were to make a large strategic business acquisition  we do not currently anticipate maintaining large outstanding debt balances in the future 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and throughout  the company reduced its capital expenditure levels in response to weaker industry conditions and uncertain timing of a recovery in customer activity levels 
in addition  the company has been assessing current operations and focusing on reducing costs to enhance the company s financial performance 
cash provided by continuing operations was generated primarily from continuing operations adjusted for depreciation and amortization offset slightly by higher working capital requirements at december  compared to december  income taxes receivable increased  at december  because of the operating losses and favorable temporary differences such as accelerated depreciation 
accounts receivable decreased to  at december  compared to  at december  because of the decrease in business activity levels and revenues 
accrued payroll and related expenses decreased  due to fewer employees and lower incentive compensation payable corresponding to the lower profitability in net cash used for investing activities decreased to  in from  in the reduction is attributable to lower levels of capital expenditures in response to weaker business conditions and the absence of payments to marine products in  while the company had to transfer cash and marketable securities of  to marine products in in connection with the spin off 
in addition  there were no acquisitions completed during while sooner testing and mathews energy services were acquired in during  the company made earnout payments of  relating to the performance of companies acquired in prior years 
net cash used for financing activities increased to  in from  in the increase was due to higher debt payments related to acquisitions from prior years  increased costs associated with the repurchase of rpc s common stock  and fewer proceeds being received from the exercise of employee stock options 
this increase was offset by lower dividend payments in compared to  due to a change in rpc s dividend declared per common share following the spin off of its powerboat manufacturing segment 
in addition  there were no payments to marine products in while there were payments totaling  to marine products in in connection with the spin off 
management has commenced preliminary discussions with a number of companies engaged in complementary businesses to explore the potential for mutually beneficial business arrangements 
while rpc has historically completed acquisitions using a combination of cash and seller financing  rpc used its stock in the acquisition of mathews energy services  and expects to use its stock as acquisition currency in one or more future transactions 
rpc is currently negotiating the purchase of a company specializing in rental and service of hydraulic chokes  valves  manifolds and flow iron 
the consideration will total approximately  funded through a combination of cash  seller financed debt and company stock 
rpc expects to close the transaction in the near future  but there is no guarantee that the transaction will be consummated on these or any other terms 
the company s retirement income plan  a trusteed defined benefit pension plan  provides monthly benefits upon retirement at age to eligible employees 
in the first quarter of  the company s board of directors approved a resolution to cease all future retirement benefit accruals under the retirement income plan effective march  however  the adverse conditions in the equity markets  along with the low interest rate environment  have had an unfavorable impact on the funded status of the company s defined benefit pension plan 
additional contributions to the pension plan may be required in to achieve the company s funding objectives 
the company s obligations and commitments that require future payments include notes payable in connection with acquisitions  a capital lease  a bank demand note  and certain non cancelable operating leases 
as of december   these obligations and commitments totaled approximately  with expected payments as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt   capital lease obligations operating leases    total contractual obligations    we believe the liquidity provided by our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least december  we believe our liquidity and overall strong capital position will allow us to continue to grow and provide the opportunity to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise 
related party transactions effective february   the company began providing certain administrative services to marine products 
the service agreements are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
charges from the company or from corporations that are subsidiaries of the company for such services aggregated approximately  in and  in the company s directors are also directors of marine products and certain officers are employees of both the company and marine products 
the company periodically purchases in the ordinary course of business products or services from vendors who are owned by significant officers or shareholders  or affiliated with the directors of rpc 
during  the total amounts paid to these affiliated parties totaled approximately  in addition  during  the overhead crane fabrication division of rpc recorded  in revenues  from the powerboat manufacturing segment that is now a subsidiary of marine products pursuant to the spin off  related to the sale  installation and service of overhead cranes
