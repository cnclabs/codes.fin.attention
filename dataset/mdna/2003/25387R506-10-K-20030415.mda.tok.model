item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
it is important to note that dvs changed its fiscal year end from march to december  beginning with the year ended december  therefore  the present report on form k covers the twelve month period for the years and and the nine month period for the year period ending december  and the pro forma results for the nine month period ending december overview dvs derives over of its revenues from the sale of loaders and components associated with dvd loaders to dvd player manufacturers 
the majority of these sales are made to dvd player manufacturers in china  korea and turkey 
average selling prices of these products have declined rapidly over the past three years and currently are over less than in the year in the year ending december   average loader prices declined 
the mix of sales continues to shift more to the components of the loader produced by the company resulting in lower average selling prices which are also experiencing price erosion 
the combination of lower prices for loaders and an unfavorable price mix has resulted in a leveling of revenues between the years and unit shipments on the other hand have more than doubled in over  allowing the company to increase its market share to over of the market for loaders sold to external player manufacturers who do not have their own loader technology 
as our product line continues to mature we are likely to experience further declines in the average selling prices of our current product offerings 
we are not able to predict the amount of such future change with any degree of certainty 
our costs of goods sold which consist of purchased components representing about of the loader cost have been reduced by about over the past two years 
purchasing volume and lower costs of assembly in our china joint venture have allowed us to maintain some margin during this period of rapid sales price declines 
at the present time gross margins have eroded to somewhere between to  depending on mix of products sold in the period 
as previously stated  this unit price erosion and resulting reduction of gross margins is likely to continue during we are at a point where new products must be introduced if we are to experience any improvement in our rate of gross margin 
the amount of engineering effort required to value engineer the loader product during the year has interrupted the new product programs of our korean subsidiary  thereby causing delays in the introduction of new products such as dvd players for the automotive market and rewritable dvd drives for the computing and audio markets 
the new product engineering group in korea is currently working extended hours to get back on schedule  and we believe that the introduction of the two previously mentioned products will occur late in the third quarter of this year 
working prototypes of both these products were shown at the korean subsidiary s annual meeting in march we are not able to predict the level of sales for these new products or their impact on our gross margins with any degree of certainty for the year our operating income as shown in the table below has gone from operating income of million in fiscal year to an operating loss of million in the year ended december  this unfavorable change of million is made up of million of increases in operating expense with the remaining million loss accounted for by the decline in our gross margins resulting from average selling prices of loaders declining by 
additional new product activity has been initiated both in korea and in the united states with the formation of mobiletouch korea and mobiletouch usa  a wholly owned subsidiary of dvs korea and the company  respectively 
the subsidiaries working in partnership with jeecom  inc will develop new products and applications directed at the corporate and consumer mobile applications market  and in particular will focus on media rich applications for the consumer market 
mobiletouch usa has begun the development of software required to optimize the utilization of new mpeg part video compression in mobile wireless products and software in support of the decoder chip also being developed by mobiletouch usa 
we believe that this new standard offers substantial benefits to many potential product areas such as  low bandwidth video for mobile handsets  dvd video  broadband entertainment  and digital cinema 
we do not expect any major sales activity from these developments in the year in january  the company announced an exclusive licensing agreement with jeecom  inc  a company founded by  and whose majority owner is  dr 
edmund sun  the company s chief technology officer 
the jeecom  inc license and software provide the platform for integrating video and other multimedia products for the mobile market with the exclusive right to market the software to the major markets of the world 
as noted above  we have sought to diversify our product base through increased emphasis on new products such as the rewritable drive which we anticipate will enjoy much greater margins and  more importantly  will sell into the larger market and customer base that dvsk has successfully established with our dvd loader products 
however  in merging these vital areas of development in  we expect to generate losses as we invest heavily in r d personnel and engineers 
our korean subsidiary dvsk raised approximately million during the last year and coupled with its line of credit is expected to be able to fund new product programs and support the existing loader business in both korea and china in the year the company plans to meet its operating obligations for by raising money through private placements and receiving management fees from its korean subsidiary 
the company s minority interest liability increased significantly during september from the reduction of its ownership interest in dvs korea  as a result of the million from dvs korea s initial public offering 
the sale of the interest in dvs korea resulted in a gain from the sale of subsidiary common stock of  which has been reflected in additional paid in capital at december  results of operations the table that follows summarizes the impact of these factors on the company s financial results in millions fiscal year ended december  fiscal year ended december  nine month fiscal period ended december  unaudited nine month fiscal period ended december  revenues gross margin research and development sales and marketing general and administrative operating loss income net loss income results of operations for the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of the company s total revenues for the twelve month periods ended december  and  the nine month period ended december   and the unaudited nine months ended december  please see our consolidated financial statements of operations and item selected consolidated financial data for additional details

overseas sales represented over of revenue for the twelve months ended december   as was the case for the twelve month period ended december  during the year ended december   vestel was the only customer which accounted for over of sales 
during the twelve months ended december   siig  our joint venture partner in china  was our only customer which accounted for over of sales 
as mentioned previously  unit sales during more than doubled over with million units shipped in  as compared to million units shipped in twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  nine months ended december  unaudited nine months ended december  in thousands gross margin as a percentage of revenue the rapid decline in gross margin rates during the year and is almost entirely attributable to the decline in the selling prices of dvd loaders during these periods 
using the average selling price of december as the base period  the following rates of decline occurred with respect to our margins to base period q q q q year year in the fourth quarter of the average selling price of a dvd loader was only of what it was in december of  a reduction of 
the average selling price declined in the year and in the year looking ahead to fiscal year ending december   we expect to experience continued pricing pressure as competition becomes more intense in the company s customer base and the dvd market 
twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  nine months ended december  unaudited nine months ended december  in thousands research and development as a percentage of revenue our research and development expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design  and development activities and providing our existing oem customers with custom design and value engineering options to meet their specific needs 
r d spending increased or million over  particularly in the second half of the fiscal year as additional engineers and support staff were added to the company in order to recover lost time in developing the new product programs and to initiate mobiletouch korea s r d efforts on the mobile phone hardware platform 
with respect to our research and development efforts we expect to generate losses during as we invest heavily in r d personnel and engineers 
twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  nine months ended december  unaudited nine months ended december  in thousands sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue sales and marketing expense is comprised primarily of employee related expenses  export freight insurance when absorbed by the company  and advertising promotional costs 
the company has sales and marketing organizations in korea  china and the us these organizations have been significantly expanded due to the shift away from major distributors hyundai in korea and siig in china used in prior years 
as a result  overall spending for sales and marketing increased  or million over twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  nine months ended december  unaudited nine months ended december  in thousands general and administrative as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expenses decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  by or million 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of administrative salaries and benefits  insurance  facility  legal  accounting  investor relations and other business support costs 
as reflected in the table above  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue remained essentially constant when compared to the twelve month period ended december  results of operations for the twelve month period ended december  compared to the nine month transition period ended december  fiscal the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of the company s total revenues for the twelve month period ended december   the nine month period ended december  and the fiscal year ended march  please see our consolidated financial statements of operations for additional details 
twelve months ended december  nine months ended december  fiscal year ended march  percent of revenue revenues gross margin research and development sales and marketing general and administrative operating income loss net income includes one time gain from sale of certain assets related to discontinued product lines 
twelve months ended december  nine months ended december  fiscal year ended march  in thousands consolidated revenue as set forth above  total revenue in the twelve month period ended december  was million  about higher than the million for the nine month period in this significant increase of million was in part due to the additional three months of the current year period coupled with the additional manufacturing brought on line in korea and in shanghai 
overseas sales represented almost of revenue for the twelve months ended december   as was the case for the nine month period ended december  during the twelve months ended december   siig  our joint venture partner in china accounted for over of sales 
net income of million for the twelve month period ended december  was lower than the million for the nine month period ended december   primarily because of increased expenses relating to the establishment of new manufacturing facilities in korea and china 
twelve months ended december  nine months ended december  fiscal year ended march  in thousands gross margin as a percentage of revenue the sharp reduction in gross margin was principally due to the opening of a new plant in korea and the opening of the factory in shanghai  china  which increased our manufacturing costs significantly during this period 
the costs relate primarily to training personnel and establishing efficient manufacturing processes 
additionally  the company increased its monthly output  as measured by net sales  an average of about  from the prior period and had to absorb the transition costs associated with such a sharp increase 
and as previously mentioned  the increased pricing pressure from competition also contributed to the decline in gross margin 
twelve months ended december  nine months ended december  fiscal year ended march  in thousands research and development as a percentage of revenue research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the twelve month period ended december   compared with for the nine month period ended december  the decrease in these expenses as a percentage of revenues is principally attributable to an increase in sales volume while maintaining essentially the same level of spending 
twelve months ended december  nine months ended december  fiscal year ended march  in thousands sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased from in the nine months ended december  to in the year ended december  the decrease in these expenses as a percentage of revenue was also the result of a sharp increase in sales volume while accompanied only by a slight increase in spending of approximately 
twelve months ended december  nine months ended december  fiscal year ended march  in thousands general and administrative as a percentage of revenue as reflected in the table above  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue remained essentially constant when compared to the nine month period ended december  the actual rate of spending increased about from the period ended december   reflecting costs associated with the establishment of sfdt and the additional manufacturing facility in korea 
results of operations for the nine month transition period ended december  compared to the unaudited pro forma nine month period ended december  the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of the company s total revenues for the nine month period ended december  and the unaudited nine month period ended december  please see item selected consolidated financial data for details 
nine months ended december  unaudited nine months ended december  percent of revenue revenues gross margin research and development sales and marketing general and administrative operating income loss net income nine months ended december  unaudited nine months ended december  in thousands consolidated revenue as reflected above  total revenue in the nine month period ended december  was million  about higher than the million for the same nine month period in this significant increase of million was primarily the result of the company s decision to focus its resources on the dvd product line  which accounted for approximately of total revenue in  as compared to in overseas sales represented almost for the nine months ended december   as compared to about for the nine months ended december  nine months ended december  unaudited nine months ended december  in thousands gross margin as a percentage of revenue gross margin increased from of revenue for the nine months ended december  to of revenue for the nine month period ended december  the improvement reflects the continuing efforts of the company to lower its costs of revenue by implementing more cost efficient production processes 
nine months ended december  unaudited nine months ended december  in thousands research and development as a percentage of revenue research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the nine month period ended december   compared with for the nine months period ended december  the decrease in these expenses as a percentage of net revenues is attributable to reducing non performing operations and focusing the engineering resources on the dvd product line  which has generated substantial growth in revenues 
the increased revenue and improved margins allowed the company to increase its research and development expenses  from million for the nine month period ended december  to million for the same period in nine months ended december  unaudited nine months ended december  in thousands sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from in the nine months ended december  to in the nine month period ended december  the decrease in these expenses as a percentage of revenue was also the result of the restructuring of the company s product lines that took place in this period to focus the sales and marketing resources on the dvd product line  which resulted in substantial increase in revenues 
the increase in revenue and improvement in margins also allowed increased allocation of capital for sales and marketing expenses  from million for the nine month period ended december  to million for the same period in nine months ended december  unaudited nine months ended december  in thousands general and administrative as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expenses increased million for the nine month period ended december  over the same period in the increase of million was primarily attributable to increased spending in professional fees for both legal and accounting services 
liquidity and capital resources at december  the company had million of cash and cash equivalents of which million was restricted as collateral for lines of credit 
our operating activities used cash of million during the principal uses of cash were increased inventory of million resulting from the sales forecasts  which are the basis for material procurement 
during the fourth quarter  our sales did not meet forecasts and volume purchases of major components beyond requirements were made in order to maximize price rebates on certain purchased components 
during  accounts receivable increased million  which was consistent with the change in terms from principally letters of credit in the year to open credit terms in we experienced a net loss in of million  as adjusted by non cash impact of depreciation and amortization of million  the impairment charge of goodwill of million  the issuance of common stock for services provided with a fair value of million  all of which was partially offset by the non cash reduction in the majority interest of the investors of our korean subsidiary dvsk and chinese joint venture  totaling million 
reduction in other short and long term liabilities totaling million were made during the year  which included million primarily representing amounts originally provided for obligations of dormant foreign operation which are no longer required 
cash provided by operating activities in was provided by an increased accounts payable and accounts payable related party of million and the return of the million deposit required during the settlement of litigation with a previous korean employee 
net cash used in investing activities was million  principally resulting from an increase in restricted cash of million used as collateral for the korean subsidiary s lines of credit  and million for molds tooling for the factory opened in the fourth quarter of in korea 
additionally the china joint venture acquired plant equipment totaling million and spent million for leasehold improvements 
offsetting the above was million written down of a note receivable from a related party due to non payment  and the maturity of marketable securities totaling million 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was million  with million in proceeds from the sale of the korean subsidiary s stock in an initial public offering in september  million from korean line of credit borrowings  and million in proceeds from a note payable from shanghai bank and secured by the joint venture facility in china 
we believe that with working capital of million at december   and the renewal of our existing lines of credit in korea  now totaling million of which we have taken down million  that our operations in asia have sufficient resources to manage both their new product plans and production requirements for the year our operations in the us will require the raising of additional capital to finance mobiletouch usa 
the company is currently in discussions with investment firms and hopes to have agreements reached for this funding in the next sixty to ninety days 
additionally  the company anticipates obtaining management fees from its subsidiaries to be advanced on a monthly basis 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
the company adopted sfas no 
on january  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses the timing and amount of costs recognized as a result of restructuring and similar activities 
the company will apply sfas no 
to activities initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated statements of income or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas no 
 stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the alternative methods of transition of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ended after december  the company follows apb in accounting for employee stock options 
the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december  and have been incorporated into these financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which requires a guarantor to recognize and measure certain types of guarantees at fair value 
in addition  interpretation no 
requires the guarantor to make new disclosures for these guarantees and other types of guarantees that are not subject to the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ended after december   while the recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company is in the process of evaluating the impact the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the company does not believe that any of these recent accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on their financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by senior management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition net revenues include product and component sales 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
shipping terms are freight on board shipping point 
returns and discounts on sales are deducted from revenue upon issuance of a credit memo 
returns for products under warranty are repaired and returned to the customer at the company s cost 
the company provides for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under its warranty at the time product revenue is recognized 
the company had a warranty reserve of  at december  allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers or channel partners were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required 
the company had a warranty reserve of  at december  excess and obsolete inventory we write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand  and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
at december  we had provided a valuation allowance for the entire amount of tax assets net of tax liabilities 
to the extent that we increase or decrease a valuation allowance in a period  the resulting expense or benefit is included within the tax provision 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
goodwill and other identifiable intangibles we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
significant under performance relative to projected operating result  changes is the manner of our use of the acquired assets and significant negative industry or economic trends are the more significant indicators that we consider 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the company after assessment has  as of december   written off its remaining balance of goodwill totaling  net of amortization 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation our majority owned foreign subsidiary and joint venture represent the vast majority of our revenues  assets  and liabilities at december  in preparing our consolidated statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign entity from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under the relevant accounting guidance are either included within the statement of operations or as a separate part of our net equity under the caption cumulative translation adjustment 
factors that may affect future results our operating results fluctuate significantly  and an unanticipated decline in revenue or earnings may disappoint investors or securities analysts and result in a decline in our stock price 
our recent growth rate may not be sustainable and you should not use our past financial performance to predict future operating results 
in addition to the losses incurred during the year ended december   we have incurred substantial net losses in the past  as recently as  among others  fiscal years ended march   and we also expect to generate losses as we invest heavily in r d personnel and engineers in connection with our research and development efforts related to new product development during our recent quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  due to the following factors  all of which are difficult to forecast and many of which are not within our control the availability  timely delivery and cost of components from our suppliers  competitive pressures and related changes in selling prices  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and significant yield losses which affect our ability to fulfill orders  new product announcements and introductions for competing products by us or our competitors  the rate at which our products become obsolete  unpredictability of changes in demand for  or in the mix of  our products  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of products utilizing our technologies  changes in the channels through which our products are distributed and the timeliness of receipt of distributor resale information  exchange rate fluctuations  general economic  political and environmental related conditions  such as natural disasters  difficulties in forecasting  planning and management of inventory levels  which may trigger lower of cost or market inventory adjustments  unanticipated research and development expenses associated with new product introductions  the timing of significant orders and of license and royalty revenue  and the seasonality in our business 
a downturn in the market for consumer products such as personal computers and dvd players that incorporate our products can also harm our operating results 
in addition  some of our customers may place orders at or near the end of a quarter 
as a result  we may not learn of revenue shortfalls until late in a quarter and may not be able to predict future revenues with accuracy 
additionally  a large portion of our costs consists of salaries for personnel and materials that must be ordered several months in advance 
these costs are based in part on our expectations for future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  any revenue shortfall below expectations could harm our business 
our capital resources may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements 
since our inception  we have periodically experienced negative cash flow from operations and could experience significant negative cash flow from operations in the future 
our current and future capital requirements are substantial and we cannot be certain that cash generated from operations will be sufficient or that financing will be available at favorable terms when required  or at all 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we may not meet our financial obligations to our creditors when they become due or we may have to curtail or cease certain operations 
we depend on a limited number of foreign suppliers to manufacture certain key components  and these manufacturers may not be able to satisfy our requirements  which could cause our revenues to decline 
we currently buy certain key components  including optical pick ups  motors  central processing units and certain other integrated circuits from a limited number of suppliers including  zoran  mediatech  and hitachi 
we anticipate that these suppliers will manufacture sufficient quantities of these key components to meet our production requirements 
if these suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis and at competitive prices  we could suffer manufacturing delays  a possible loss of revenues or higher than anticipated costs of revenues  any of which could seriously harm our operating results 
any constraints on worldwide manufacturing capacity of these key components may affect our ability to obtain adequate supplies from these manufacturers 
in certain instances  we have failed to meet the demand for our products or the scheduled shipment dates due to our inability to obtain a sufficient supply of certain key components from our suppliers 
the suppliers with which we currently are working with  together with any additional supplier at which capacity might be obtained  may not be willing or able to satisfy all of our manufacturing requirements on a timely basis at favorable prices 
in addition  we have encountered delays in qualifying new products and increasing new product production and could experience these delays in the future 
we are also subject to the risks of service disruptions  raw material shortages and price increases by our suppliers 
such disruptions  shortages and price increases could seriously harm our operating results 
if we are unable to increase our manufacturing capacity  we may not achieve our planned growth 
notwithstanding our recent expansion efforts  in order to grow  we need to increase our present manufacturing capacity 
events that we have not foreseen could arise which would limit our manufacturing capacity 
in addition  if we cannot satisfactorily increase our manufacturing capacity  our ability to grow will be severely impaired and this may harm our operating results 
our financing requirements will increase in order to obtain additional manufacturing capacity in the future 
to obtain additional manufacturing capacity  we may be required to make deposits  equipment purchases  loans  joint ventures  equity investments or technology licenses in or with other companies 
these transactions could involve a commitment of substantial amounts of our capital and technology licenses in return for production capacity 
we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing if we need substantial capital in order to secure this capacity and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we or our suppliers fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields  we will experience higher costs of revenues and reduced product availability 
the fabrication of our products requires certain components produced in a highly controlled and clean environment 
companies that supply our components sometimes have experienced problems achieving acceptable manufacturing yields 
low yields may result from marginal design or manufacturing process drift 
yield problems may not be identified until the components are well into the production process  which often makes them difficult  time consuming and costly to correct 
furthermore  we rely on overseas suppliers of certain key components  which increases the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
if our suppliers fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields  we will experience higher costs of revenues and reduced product availability  which would harm our operating results 
if our suppliers discontinue the manufacturing processes or lines needed to meet our demands  or fail to upgrade the technologies needed to manufacture our products  we may face production delays and lower revenues 
our products requirements may represent a small portion of the total production of the suppliers that manufacture our components 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that a supplier may cease production on an older or lower volume manufacturing process that it uses to produce our parts 
additionally  we cannot be certain our suppliers will continue to devote resources to advance the production technologies on which the manufacturing of our parts is based 
each of these events could increase our costs and harm our ability to deliver our products on time 
our growth and future profitability depend upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new dvd products 
during the last three years  a substantial amount of revenues have been generated by the dvd product line  which is central to our growth strategy 
the market for this line of products has experienced intense competition and is highly price sensitive 
the average unit selling price for our dvd loader products has decreased and we expect it to continue to decrease in the foreseeable future 
unless we obtain an equally reduced cost of revenues  our gross margins will continue to decline 
successful development and commercialization of new products is essential to our growth and future profitability 
while we are currently developing and introducing new products in this product line  we cannot assure you that these products will reach the market in a timely manner  satisfactorily address customer needs  be sold in high volume  or be sold at profitable margins 
in addition  we expect to generate losses as we invest heavily in r d personnel and engineers during our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand  therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we therefore have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
consequently  our operating results will be harmed if our revenues do not meet our revenue projections 
we may experience revenue shortfalls for the following reasons significant pricing pressures that occur due to competition  over supply  or other reasons  sudden shortages of raw materials or fabrication  test or assembly capacity constraints that lead our suppliers to allocate available supplies or capacity to other customers which  in turn  harm our ability to meet our sales obligations  and the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders 
in addition  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on customers advance orders  commitments or forecasts  as well as our internal assessment and forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially  especially if competition becomes more intense or the demand is reduced due to seasonal or other factors 
from time to time  in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from our suppliers  we may order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
this advance ordering may result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize 
because our products typically have lengthy sales cycles  we may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of revenues 
it usually requires a number of months to realize volume shipments after we first contact a customer 
we first work with customers to achieve a design win  which may take months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production  over a period which typically lasts months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between the time we incur expenses from our research and development efforts and our realization of revenue  if any  from volume purchasing of our products by our customers 
we face intense competition from companies with significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources that could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase sales of our products 
we compete with major international electronics companies  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution  and other resources than we do 
many of our competitors have their own facilities for the production of semiconductor components and have been active in increasing their market shares and their capacity for the production of competing products 
our dvd products presently account for substantially all of our revenues 
our competitors or potential competitors include hitachi  toshiba  sony  pioneer  teac  sanyo  samsung  philips  lg  and many others 
some of our competitors or potential competitors are also suppliers of key components for some of our products 
in these cases  our competitors may have divisions making competing dvd products that have access to some of our proprietary information through the divisions supplying components to us  or exert influence on the parts supplying divisions in ways that may adversely affect our parts supply 
these actions would adversely affect our competitiveness and sales 
competition may also come from alternative technologies being developed by these companies 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change and  therefore  our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving and competing industry standards  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  increased integration with other functions  and rapid product obsolescence 
to develop new products for our target markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to expand our technical and design expertise 
in addition  we must have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet their changing needs 
in addition  dvd products involve continually evolving industry standards 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these industry standards 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and effort and incur significant expense to redesign our products and ensure compliance with relevant standards 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify new product opportunities successfully  develop and bring to market new products  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by our competitors 
in addition  we may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense 
failure in any of these areas could harm our operating results 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key design engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify  recruit and retain additional personnel 
we are highly dependent on our principal management and engineering staff 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in our industry  in particular the highly skilled technical personnel involved in the development of dvd technologies and the production of dvd products 
competition is especially intense in silicon valley  where our corporate headquarters are located  and in south korea  where our dvd products have been designed and where most of our manufacturing takes place 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employ in the future 
our anticipated growth is expected to place increased demands on our resources and will likely require the addition of new management and engineering personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
the failure to recruit and retain key technical and management personnel could harm our business 
our ability to compete successfully will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights  and we may be unable to do so 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secrets  copyright and mask work production laws and rights  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
policing unauthorized use of our products  however  is difficult  especially in foreign countries  such as china and south korea  where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
litigation may continue to be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
we have acquired ownership or license to a number of patents or patent applications related to our products 
however  we cannot assure you that any pending patent application will be granted  or that such patents will provide adequate protection for our intellectual property 
since our competitors may design around our patents or otherwise independently develop competing technology  our operating results would be seriously harmed by the failure to protect our intellectual property 
if we are accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of other parties we may become subject to time consuming and costly litigation 
if we lose such litigation  we could suffer a significant impact on our business and be forced to pay damages 
third parties may assert that our products infringe their proprietary rights  or may assert claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims against us 
any such claims may cause us to delay or cancel shipment of our products or pay damages  which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs in defending against such claims 
in addition  we receive from time to time letters or communications from other companies stating that such companies have patent rights relating to our products 
any legal finding that we infringe the patent of another company would have a significantly negative effect on our operating results 
furthermore  if such a finding were made  there can be no assurance that we could license the other company s technology on commercially reasonable terms or that we could successfully operate without such technology 
moreover  if we are found to infringe  we could be required to pay damages to the owner of the protected technology and could be prohibited from making  using or selling any products that infringe the protected technology 
in addition  the management attention consumed by and legal cost associated with any litigation could have a negative effect on our operating results 
during the course of lawsuits there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions  and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
whether or not we are successful in any litigation  we expect the litigation to consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources 
further  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with this type of litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure 
general economic conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our business 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions 
because of the recent economic slowdown in the united states  many industries are delaying or reducing technology purchases 
the impact of this slowdown on us is difficult to predict  but it may result in reductions in purchases of products by our end user customers  longer sales cycles and increased price competition 
as a result  if the current economic slowdown continues or worsens  we may fall short of our revenue expectations for any given quarter in or for the entire year 
our business may suffer due to risks associated with international sales and operations 
sales of products overseas accounted for   and of our revenues in the fiscal year ended march   the nine month period ended december   the fiscal year ended december  and the fiscal year ended december   respectively 
our international business activities are subject to a number of risks  each of which could impose unexpected costs on us that would have an adverse effect on our operating results 
these risks include difficulties in complying with foreign regulatory requirements and standards  tariffs and other trade barriers relating to cross border transactions  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles from customers located in foreign countries  potentially adverse tax consequences resulting from changes in international tax regulations  limits on repatriation of earnings from our foreign operations  and limited ability to effect quality control measures associated with our foreign operations 
we derived most of our product revenue from asia during the last three years 
additionally  our major suppliers and assembly subcontractors are all located in asia 
any kind of economic  political or environmental instability in this region of the world can have a severe negative impact on our operating results due to the large concentration of our production and sales activities in this region 
for example  during and  several asian countries where we currently do business  such as japan  taiwan and south korea  experienced severe currency fluctuation and economic deflation 
if such situations reoccur  it may negatively impact our total revenues and our ability to collect payments from customers in these regions 
during such situations  the lack of capital in the financial sectors of these countries can make it difficult for our customers to open letters of credit or other financial instruments that are guaranteed by foreign banks 
finally  the economic situation during such periods may exacerbate a decline in selling prices for our products as our competitors may reduce product prices to generate needed cash 
in addition  we are greatly impacted by the political  economic and military conditions in taiwan and china  and north korea and south korea  which are continuously engaged in political disputes 
these countries have recently conducted military exercises in or near the other s territorial waters and airspace 
such disputes may continue and even escalate  resulting in an economic embargo  a disruption in shipping or even military hostilities 
this could severely harm our business by interrupting or delaying production or shipment of our products 
any kind of activity of this nature or even rumors of such activity could severely negatively impact our operations  revenues  operating results  and stock price 
we may encounter significant difficulties in understanding local business practices that may require additional expenditures 
as a substantial portion of our operations are located in asia and subject to foreign laws and regulations  our operations in asia may be adversely affected by changes in local laws and regulations  such as those relating to accounting practices  taxation  import and export tariffs  environmental regulations  land use rights  property and other matters 
local governments may impose new  stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations  which would require additional expenditures 
asian economies may also differ in terms of structure  government involvement  level of development  growth rate  capital reinvestment  allocation of resources  self sufficiency and rate of inflation  among others 
as a result  we may encounter significant difficulties in understanding and addressing local business practices that may require us to incur additional expenses in connection with our international operations 
because a small number of customers have accounted for  and are likely to continue to account for  a substantial portion of our revenues  our revenues could decline due to the loss of one of these customers 
products sold to our top five customers accounted for approximately of our revenues during the year ended december  products sold to our top customers accounted for approximately and of our revenues during the nine month period ended december   the fiscal year ended december   and the fiscal year ended december   respectively 
in the fiscal year ended december   vestel accounted for of our revenue 
in the fiscal year ended december   siig accounted for about of our revenue 
in the fiscal year ended march   hyundai accounted for about of our revenue 
in the nine month period ended december   hyundai accounted for about of our revenue 
no other customers accounted for more than of our revenues during these three periods 
if we were to lose any of these customers or experience any substantial reduction in orders from these customers  our revenues and operating results would suffer 
we do not have long term contracts with our customers and the loss of a major customer could seriously harm our business 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers  and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
when we do enter into a long term contract  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the customer 
an early termination by one of our major customers would harm our financial results  as it is unlikely that we would be able to rapidly replace that revenue source 
our backlog may not result in future revenue  which would seriously harm our business 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
a reduction of backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future revenue  could harm our business 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations are vulnerable to interruptions by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
our facilities in northern california may be subject to electrical blackouts as a consequence of a shortage of available electrical power 
in the event these blackouts occur  continue or increase in severity  they could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities 
in connection with the shortage of available power  prices for electricity have risen dramatically  and may continue to increase for the foreseeable future 
such price changes will increase our operating costs  which could in turn hurt our profitability 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur  and any losses or damages incurred by us could harm our business 
we may require additional capital in order to bring new products to market  and the issuance of new equity securities will dilute your investment in our common stock 
to permit the growth of our business operations in the future  we need to expand our production capacity and bring new products to market  which will likely require significant working capital 
we have established credit facilities with certain korean banks with a total borrowing limit of about million as of december  we have also formed alliances with state run businesses in china  which have committed to substantial amounts of trade credit and financing for production in china under certain terms 
however  there is no assurance that these credit facilities will always be available 
we may also need to sell shares of our common stock or seek additional borrowings or outside capital infusions in the future 
we cannot assure you that such financing options will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  and at the time and place that we need them 
in addition  if we issue shares of our common stock  our shareholders will experience dilution with respect to their investment 
our growth continues to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources and if we fail to manage our growth  our ability to market and sell our products and develop new products may be harmed 
our business is experiencing rapid growth which has strained our internal systems and will require us to develop or adopt more sophisticated information management systems in order to manage the business effectively 
although we have implemented an erp system  there is no guarantee that this system and any new systems implemented in the future will be adequate to address our expected growth  or that management will be able to foresee in a timely manner other infrastructure needs before they arise 
our success depends on the ability of our executive officers to effectively manage our growth 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our results of operations will be seriously harmed 
the price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 
our stock has closed at prices ranging from a high of on december  to a low of on june  if our revenues do not grow or grow more slowly than we anticipate  or if operating or capital expenditures exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the market price of our common stock has been in the past and could in the future be materially and adversely affected for reasons unrelated to our specific business or results of operations 
general market price declines or volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
in addition  short term trading strategies of certain investors can also have a significant effect on the price of specific securities 
the exercise of warrants or options may depress our stock price 
there are a significant number of warrants and options to purchase our common stock outstanding 
holders may sell the common stock acquired upon exercise of the warrants and options at a market price that exceeds the exercise price of the warrants and options paid by the holders 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by holders of warrants or options may depress the prevailing market price for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the future sale of our equity securities 
we do not expect to pay dividends 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock  and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and therefore  do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
therefore  you may not receive any return on an investment in our common in the form of dividends 
provisions of our corporate charter documents could delay or prevent a change of control 
our certificate of incorporation grants our board of directors the authority to determine the relative rights and preferences of our preferred stock and gives the board the authority to issue such shares  all without further stockholder approval 
as a result  our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders preferred rights to our company s assets upon liquidation  the right to special voting privileges  the right to receive dividends before dividends would be declared upon the common stock and the right to redemption of such shares  together with a premium  prior to the redemption of common stock 
our common stockholders have no redemption rights 
the ability of the board to issue large blocks of preferred stock could have a potential anti takeover effect  and the issuance of preferred stock in accordance with such authority may delay or prevent a change of control of our company 
risks related to our industry the selling prices for our products are very volatile and subject to industry wide fluctuations 
our success is dependent on the growth and strength of the pc market and the dvd video market 
with a focus on the dvd product line  most of our revenues in the last three years were generated from dvd products 
most of our new products currently being developed are in the dvd product line  particularly dvd loaders 
the sales of our dvd loaders are related to the markets for dvd video discs and dvd video players 
if we experience an unforeseen downturn in the markets for dvd video discs and dvd video players or a global over supply in the production of dvd loaders  our results of operations from our dvd loaders business will be adversely affected 
our business could be harmed by such industry wide fluctuations in the future 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry could create fluctuations in our operating results 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  there are shortages or over production of memory or other types of devices 
our business could be harmed by such industry wide fluctuations in the future because our products incorporate these technologies 
when a shortage occurs with one or more key components  it may be difficult for us to produce enough quantities of products to fill customers orders  and it may require us to pay a higher price for the components in the event of a shortage  adversely affecting our margin and profitability 
there is seasonality in our business 
sales of our products in the computer peripherals market and consumer electronics market are subject to seasonality 
seasonal purchasing patterns generally lead to higher sales occurring in the second half of each calendar year although there may be a sharp decline of sales near the christmas and new year s holidays 
sales to china and certain other asian regions may also decline near the lunar new year s holidays in january or february 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in factors that may affect future results 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our investments consist primarily of commercial paper and certificates of deposits 
due to the nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
cash equivalents and short term investment are carried at cost  which approximated market value  and investments in marketable debt securities are carried at amortized cost  which approximates market value 
foreign currency risk we develop products in the united states  korea and china and market our products in north america and the asia pacific region 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as our sales are primarily in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets
