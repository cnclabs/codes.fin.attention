item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and item selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
additional information concerning factors that could cause results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements is contained under item business risk factors 
introduction we were founded in september  to create a national  single source provider of document and information outsourcing solutions to document and information intensive industries  including financial services  government  legal  healthcare and transportation 
we acquired the seven founding companies the founding companies simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering the ipo on january   and effectively began operations at that time 
the consideration for the founding companies consisted of a combination of cash and common stock of our company 
since the ipo  we have acquired companies and divested operating units by sales or closures 
we evaluate candidates for acquisition and periodically for divestiture as a part of our strategic plan of providing customers a single solution for business process outsourcing 
the criteria for evaluation include geographic need  additional technology  market growth potential  industry expertise  service expansion to broaden service offerings  expansion of our customer base  revenue and earnings growth potential  and expected sources and uses of capital 
significant developments acquisitions effective january   we acquired united information services uis  located in iowa  and expanded the company s statement solutions service offering  which had existing locations in arizona and new york 
see note  business combinations  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
legal proceedings on february   prior to the acquisition by the company  managed care professionals  inc one of our wholly owned subsidiaries mcp entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with healthcare marketing associates  inc hma whereby mcp granted to hma the exclusive right to market  and hma agreed to market exclusively for mcp  the mcp products and services to health care providers in the united states for which mcp agreed to pay hma a percentage of gross revenues paid to mcp by the provider customer 
the duration of the agreement was for a period of five years and expired on february  termination date 
on april   hma filed a lawsuit against mcp in the circuit court of the county of st 
louis  state of missouri  alleging entitlement to commissions on revenues generated from providers after the termination date who were initially brought to mcp prior to the termination date 
on august   our motion for summary judgment was denied 
in march  this lawsuit was tried before a judge and at the conclusion of the trial  the judge ruled in the plaintiff s favor in the amount of million plus prejudgment interest  which equates to approximately million in total as of march  the judgment amount plus prejudgment interest costs have been included in the company s results 
we intend to appeal this ruling 
we believe we have meritorious points of error for appeal and intend to continue to vigorously defend the claims made against us in this matter 
strategic realignment plan during the second and third quarters of  we completed several steps involved with a strategic realignment plan 
we completed a strategic review of our operations and determined markets that we intended to concentrate on for future growth 
additionally  we identified certain non strategic service offerings for divestiture or closure  and accordingly  developed and committed to a divestiture plan 
the divested service offerings were evaluated based on criteria such as market growth potential  current operating performance  revenue and earnings growth potential  and expected sources and uses of capital 
this plan resulted in divestitures comprising approximately of revenues and of operating income 
during  we completed the sale or closure of operating units pursuant to the divesture plan 
these units related to the following services i automated litigation support  ii high speed  multiple set reproduction of documents  iii records acquisition in the form of subpoena of business documents and service of process  iv commercial system integration services  and v investor services 
we sold these units for million of net consideration and collected million of this consideration by december  the remaining million of net consideration is expected to be settled in these divested units had a net book value of million 
additionally  we recorded liabilities of million for exiting costs  personnel costs and various selling expenses 
as of december   million of these costs have been paid  with the remaining million to be settled in see note  strategic realignment plan  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
business segments we aggregate our service offerings and operations into two reportable segments i information management and distribution  and ii healthcare  regulatory  and legal compliance 
our reportable segments are organized around customer types and service offerings possessing similar economic characteristics 
we evaluate segment performance based on revenue  operating income  and income before income taxes 
all centrally incurred corporate costs are allocated to the segments based principally on operating income 
the reporting segments follow the same accounting policies used for our consolidated financial statements as described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
at january   we transferred four operating units from the healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment to the information management and distribution segment and one operating unit from the information management and distribution segment to the healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment 
these transfers were completed to better align these operating units results with operating units of similar core competencies 
the identified segments are as follows information management and distribution 
we offer business process solutions including electronic conversion services  analog services  data capture and database management services  internet repository services  and print and mail services  including statement processing  direct mail and fulfillment services and in bound mail services 
in  project revenue accounted for of the segment s revenue with recurring revenue accounting for the remaining 
healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance 
our services include medical records release  off site active storage of a healthcare institutions medical records  online delivery of images of selected medical records  temporary staffing services  managed care compliance reviews  legal claims administration  and professional economic research services and litigation services 
in  project revenue accounted for of the segment s revenue with recurring revenue accounting for the remaining 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items as shown in item selected financial data expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  revenue cost of services special charges depreciation gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special charges amortization operating income loss interest and other expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss cost of services consists primarily of compensation and benefits to employees providing goods and services to our clients  occupancy costs  equipment costs  and supplies 
our cost of services also includes the cost of products sold for micrographics supplies and equipment  computer hardware and software  and business imaging supplies and equipment 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to sales and marketing  executive management  accounting  human resources and other administrative employees  other sales and marketing costs  communications costs  insurance costs  and legal and accounting professional fees and expenses 
special charges represent expenses and asset write downs associated with the strategic realignment plan 
we sold or closed operating units pursuant to this plan 
special charges consist primarily of net loss or gain on sale or closure  other asset write downs  and accrued contingencies such as legal claims  contract termination costs and various disposal expenses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue our revenue possesses both project and recurring characteristics 
project revenue includes one time projects in which the customer relationship is not expected to continue after project completion 
project revenue margins are usually higher than our average margins and the workload can be highly volatile 
project revenue is typically based on time and material arrangements and predominately occurs within our healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment 
recurring revenue is characterized by customer relationships that are generally for one year and may continue for longer 
recurring revenue is typically based on transaction volumes sent to us by our customers at an agreed upon fixed rate per unit 
our customers volumes are generally not contractually or otherwise guaranteed 
recurring revenue typically possesses lower margins than project revenue but is usually more predictable 
total revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  divested operating units and lower project revenue contributed million and million  respectively  to the decline 
recurring revenue increased million reflecting a shift in revenue mix between our project and recurring revenue 
revenue within our information management and distribution segment increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to strong business volumes from our government and mortgage industry customers and the strategic acquisition of united information services uis  a provider of statement processing services  during the first quarter of segment revenues were negatively impacted by direct mail volumes that were down million or compared to the prior year primarily due to the decline in industry spending  especially since september   and to customers reduced advertising budgets resulting from continued softness in the current economic environment 
during the third quarter of  the city of new york human resources administration informed us that we did not receive their renewal contract award 
this contract contributed approximately million of revenue in the information management and distribution segment in and is expected to be transitioned to the new vendor during the second quarter of project revenue accounted for of the information management and distribution segment s revenue in compared to in revenue within our healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to lower project revenue within our legal claims administration services  which was down approximately million 
several large legal claims administration cases were completed during while the current year consisted mostly of medium size projects with one large project during the third and fourth quarters of the lower project revenue in our legal claims administration services was partially offset by increased volumes from our healthcare medical coding services and from our legal consulting and compliance services 
project revenue accounted for of the healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment s revenue in compared to in gross profit gross profit decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  divested operating units contributed million or to the decline 
gross profit decreased an additional million or primarily due to lower project revenue  which historically produces higher margins than our recurring business  lower volumes from direct mail services and pricing pressures primarily in the information management and distribution segment 
other significant factors contributing to lower gross profit during the current year include higher employee medical insurance costs of million and increased worker s compensation insurance expense of million 
consequently  gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative sg a increased from million  or of revenue for the year ended december  to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  overall our sg a increased from higher medical insurance costs of million and higher performance based incentive compensation of million  offset by expense control and reduction initiatives implemented during the first quarter of and million of sg a costs incurred by operating units divested during other factors contributing to higher sg a costs include i an unfavorable court ruling involving an isolated legal matter in our healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment resulting in sg a expense of million related to legal and interest costs  and ii higher personnel related costs of million in our information management and distribution segment related to sales and marketing  operational project management and technology personnel to support the information management growth strategy 
operating income loss operating income loss improved from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the year over year improvement relates to the million of special charges incurred during from the divestitures and closures  and the elimination of goodwill amortization during as a result of adopting sfas no 
offsetting the favorable items were the decline in project revenue in our legal claims administration services  the overall shift in revenue mix from higher margin project revenue to lower margin recurring revenue  pricing pressures primarily in the information management and distribution segment  and the higher sg a expenses discussed above 
interest and other expense interest and other expense decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower balances on long term obligations  lower interest rates and the write down of million of deferred debt costs due to refinancing long term obligations in the average interest rate on borrowings decreased from in to in the interest rate on borrowings is predominantly variable in nature with the exception of the interest rate hedge which was placed in effect during december  effectively fixing the interest cost for million of long term obligations through march see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
however  interest rate risk exists for the remaining million of long term obligations at december  increases in short term rates would have the effect of increasing interest expense and lowering operating results in future periods 
income loss before income taxes income loss before income taxes improved from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   largely due to the items discussed above 
pro forma results to reflect divestitures and special charges the consolidated gaap results for include  through the effective date of divestiture  the operating units that were divested in the second and third quarters of as the strategic realignment plan was completed in  the consolidated gaap results for represent our ongoing results that exclude the results from operations of the divested companies and closed facilities through the effective date of divestiture or closure  and the related special charges from the divestitures and closures 
in order to provide year over year comparability  the following table presents pro forma ongoing results 
we believe this presentation is meaningful in analyzing trends in our ongoing operations and the best measure for determining future operating performance 
year ended december  in thousands consolidated gaap pro forma adjustments pro forma results consolidated gaap pro forma adjustments pro forma results revenue      gross profit      sg a      operating income loss     interest and other expense  net    income loss before tax     year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue revenue decreased  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  major contributors to the decline were lower revenue from the divested operating units of million and lower volumes in our direct mail services of million as customers moderated their promotional activities in a sluggish economy 
partially offsetting this decline were higher volumes in our information management services and acquisition related revenues 
revenues in our project oriented legal claims administration services were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of due to delays in new projects as well as reduced volumes on existing projects 
gross profit gross profit decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  divested operating units contributed million to the decline partially offset by the higher volumes in information management services and the gross profit contribution from acquisitions 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to i sg a from acquisitions in and  ii infrastructure investments related to the centralization of certain accounting  management and human resource functions to more effectively manage our businesses  and iii additional outside consulting fees  primarily valuation and state tax planning  to minimize the company s overall tax burden and improve operating cash flow 
offsetting the increase was lower sg a costs related to operating units divested in operating income loss operating income loss decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the related special charges from the divestitures and closures in and declines in direct mail services and in the healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment were the main contributors to the decline 
strong growth from and acquisitions and volume improvements in our information management services partially offset the previously discussed declines 
interest and other expense interest and other expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to the write down of million of deferred debt costs due to refinancing long term obligations in the average interest rate on borrowings decreased from in to in income loss before income taxes and net income loss income loss before income taxes decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to the factors discussed above 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations revenue from our services shows no overall significant seasonal variations  however  some seasonality exists at the operating unit level 
further  service revenue can vary from period to period due to the impact of specific projects and the level of transaction volumes sent to us by our customers 
quarterly results may also vary as a result of the timing of acquisitions and the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of working capital  including million of cash 
cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to our focus on shortening the order to cash cycle resulting in improved collections in accounts receivable 
net accounts receivable were million at december  compared to million at december  our days sales outstanding improved days to business days at december  compared to business days at december  during the year ended december   million of uncollectible trade receivables were written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
while these write offs had no impact on cash flows or operating results during  these write offs lowered our cash taxes paid during due to the related tax deduction 
for the year ended december   investing activities consisted primarily of additions to property  plant and equipment of million and acquisition related payments of million 
acquisition related payments consist of the purchase of uis in the first quarter of and certain other cash payments related to contingent consideration agreements of past acquisitions 
net cash used for financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily related to payments of million on our line of credit  net of proceeds borrowed from our line of credit of million 
at december   we had million of working capital and million of cash 
cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily impacted by cash savings from tax planning and strong cash flow from recent acquisitions 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of payments of million for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  and the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
these outflows were offset by the net proceeds received from the sale of operating units 
net proceeds from sale of operating units were used for payment on the credit facility resulting in net cash provided by financing activities of million 
net reductions in debt were million for the year 
at december   we had million of working capital and million of cash 
cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  were million 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily impacted by an increase in earnings 
this increase was offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses  which were attributable to the increase in revenue for the year 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of payments of million for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  and the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  as we utilized our credit facility to fund our acquisition program 
net proceeds from borrowings were million for the year 
in april  we entered into a line of credit agreement with bank of america  suntrust bank and wells fargo bank  as co agents the credit agreement 
under this agreement  we can from time to time borrow up to million through april   subject to certain customary borrowing capacity requirements 
meeting these requirements is highly dependent upon maintaining a minimum level of operating results and the continued demand for our services  among other factors 
effective april   we extended million of the million commitment for an additional year to april  in september  additional extensions were granted by member banks  bringing the total commitment extended to april  to million 
we paid fees of approximately million for extending the commitment 
management believes that it has sufficient liquidity from its cash flow and its revolving credit facility to meet ongoing business needs 
however  our ability to borrow is contingent on certain leverage and fixed cost coverage ratios 
after application of such ratios and our total commercial commitments of million for standby letters of credit  we had million available to borrow under the credit agreement as of december  in september  an amendment was approved that extends the current fixed cost coverage ratio requirement of until january  this ratio was set to become more restrictive in the fourth quarter of by increasing to 
under the amended agreement  the fixed cost ratio will remain at until january  and will increase to at all times thereafter 
additionally  depending on the mix of stock and cash used in our strategic acquisition program  if any  we may need to seek further financing through the public or private sale of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance we could secure such financing if and when it is needed or on terms we deem acceptable 
in april  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
under this program  share repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market as market conditions warrant 
repurchased shares will be retired and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of the company 
as of december   no shares had been repurchased by the company under this program 
during the first quarter of  we activated million of such program and between january  and march    shares were repurchased at an average cost of per share 
in january  we registered on form s registration no 
 shares of common stock for issuance in connection with our acquisition program the acquisition shelf  of which  shares were available as of december  the following table summarizes our total contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year to years to years after years long term debt    capital lease obligations operating leases      total contractual cash obligations    we have total commercial commitments of million for standby letters of credit as of december  we have a letter of credit for million to serve as a guarantee for periodic principal and interest payments related to debt 
we have a million letter of credit to serve as a guarantee for performance under a contract with the new york state workers compensation board 
additionally  we have a million letter of credit to serve as security for our workmen s compensation program 
the million letter of credit related to the new york state workers compensation board was reduced to million effective january  critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the related consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that  as a result of the judgments  uncertainties  uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved  could result in material changes to our financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we apply a consistent methodology at the end of each quarter to determine our account balances that require judgmental analysis 
revenue recognition 
we recognize our revenue as it becomes realized or realizable and earned according to the criteria provided by staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue recognition occurs once persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or otherwise determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
our revenue earnings activities possess both project and recurring customer relationships 
project revenue includes one time projects in which the customer relationship is not expected to continue after project completion 
project revenue is typically based on time and material arrangements 
revenue recognition occurs at the contractual rates as the labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
project revenue represents approximately of total revenues and typically occurs within our healthcare  regulatory  and legal compliance segment 
recurring revenue is characterized by customer relationships that are generally for one year and may continue for longer 
recurring revenue is typically based on the transaction volumes provided by our customer at an agreed upon fixed rate per unit 
our customer s volumes are typically not contractual or otherwise guaranteed 
revenue recognition occurs once work is completed and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
recurring revenue represents the remaining of total revenues and typically occurs within our information management and distribution segment 
as a part of providing services to our customers  we incur incidental expenses commonly referred to as out of pocket expenses 
these expenses include items such as airfare  hotels  and mileage and are often reimbursable by our customers 
when reimbursable  we record both revenue and direct cost of services in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
unearned income  included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  represents payments from our customers in advance of services being provided 
advanced payments are deferred as unearned income when received and recognized as revenue as services are rendered 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established and maintained based on our estimate of accounts receivable collectibility 
management estimates collectibility by specifically analyzing accounts receivable and other historical factors that affect collections 
such factors include the historical trends of write offs and recovery of previously written off accounts  the financial strength of the customer and projected economic and market conditions 
the evaluation of these factors involves subjective judgments and changes in these factors may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
long lived asset impairment 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  management continually evaluates whether events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
when events require  management performs the valuation by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the long lived assets to the carrying amount of the asset being evaluated 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of assets being evaluated exceeds the expected future undiscounted cash flow 
at december   no events were evident that required valuation for potential impairment 
goodwill impairment 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement states that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment 
the impairment test is based on fair value rather than undiscounted cash flows 
additionally  goodwill and other intangible assets are tested at a reporting unit level rather than the individual operating unit level 
reporting units are defined as one level below the reportable segment level 
management utilizes estimates to determine fair value of the reporting units 
these estimates include future cash flows  growth rates  capital needs  and projected earning margins among other factors 
estimates utilized in future calculations could differ from estimates used in the current period 
future years estimates that are unfavorable compared to current estimates could cause an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets which could result in an impairment charge that could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements during the period incurred 
self insurance liabilities and reserves 
we are self insured for workmen s compensation liabilities and a significant portion of our employee medical costs 
we account for our self insurance programs based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims  including losses for which claims have not been reported 
these loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
we limit our risk by carrying stop loss policies for significant claims incurred for both workmen s compensation liabilities and medical costs 
other loss contingencies 
we record liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as regulators 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june   thereby eliminating the pooling of interests method of accounting 
sfas no 
also addresses the recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
the adoption of sfas no 
by the company on july   did not have a significant effect on the company s financial statements 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on january  upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment 
at january   the company compared the fair values of the reporting units to their carrying values 
in determining the fair values of the reporting units  the company used the discounted cash flow method and the market value approach method 
since the fair values of all reporting units exceeded the carrying values  no impairment was recorded at january  in october  the company performed the annual test for impairment using the discounted cash flow method and the market value approach method 
since the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value  no impairment was recorded 
other intangible assets with definite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
impairment will be evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
see note  business combinations  of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the statement retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations 
it also expands the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
the provisions of sfas no 
 which the company adopted on january   did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets will be tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement supersedes fasb emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
the provisions of the new standard are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
we do not believe that sfas no 
will have a material impact on our future earnings and financial condition 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   while the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual reports ending after december  the company adopted the disclosure provisions of fin during the fourth quarter of fiscal and such adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the company is assessing  but at this point does not believe the adoption of the recognition and initial measurement requirements of this interpretation will have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations 
the company adopted fasb eitf issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  on january  eitf issue requires that reimbursements for out of pocket expenses such as  airfare  hotels  mileage  etc  be characterized as revenue in the income statement 
the effect of this reclassification on the year ended december  was million increase in revenue  million increase in cost of services  no change in selling  general and administrative expenses and no effect on net income 
the effect of this reclassification on the year ended december  was million increase in revenue  million increase in cost of services  million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and no effect on net income 
prior years amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for companies that voluntarily adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  and for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  the company adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
on december  and will continue to account for stock based employee compensation expense under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
see note  stockholders equity  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our term loans  revolving credit facility and industrial revenue bonds 
interest rates are fixed on the capitalized lease obligations 
we entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of million to hedge  through march   our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on million of our revolving credit facility 
this swap has been designated by us as a cash flow hedge 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of million million  net of tax  which was recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in accounts payable and accrued liabilities with an offset recorded in equity as other comprehensive loss 
we do not currently expect to extend this hedge at this time 
upon expiration of the hedge  a basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in approximately million of additional expense in based on our expected average balance outstanding under the credit facility during
