overview we provide system level solutions for the high performance analog and wireless networking markets 
we focus on four fast growing markets power management  optical storage cd and dvd recordable  flat panel displays and wireless networking 
we bring added customer value by providing silicon  software and reference design solutions to new products that enhance the computing experience 
basis of presentation we were formed on august  through a series of transactions  in which we and our wholly owned subsidiary  intersil communications  inc  or intersil communications  acquired the semiconductor business of harris corporation  or harris 
intersil corporation  or intersil and its wholly owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries include the operations of the predecessor 

table of contents pursuant to a form k filed on march   we elected to change our fiscal year end from the friday closest to june to the friday closest to december our stub year began on july  and ended december  on march   we sold the assets of our discrete power products group to fairchild semiconductor corporation  or fairchild for million in cash and the assumption by fairchild of certain liabilities of the product group 
the consolidated balance sheet as of december  has been reduced by the assets purchased and liabilities assumed by fairchild 
additionally  the operating results of our discrete power products group are shown under the caption operating results of certain operations disposed of during in the consolidated statements of operations 
on may   we consummated the merger with elantec 
the merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the results of operations of elantec have been included in the accompanying financial schedules since the merger date 
quarterly results the following table sets forth the unaudited historical quarterly revenue of our product groups without our discrete power products group fiscal year fiscal year q q q q q q q q in millions revenue power management elantec standard analalog wireless networking automotive total revenue our power management products are designed into desktop and notebook computers  file servers  workstations and a variety of portable computing devices 
elantec focuses on optical storage cd and dvd recordable  lcd flat panel display and dsl markets 
the standard analog portfolio includes switches  muxes and interface devices for computing  communications  test and instrumentation  medical  industrial and other applications 
wireless networking products are used for wireless lan wlan including a variety of standards 
lastly  we sold analog products for the automotive industry 
with the sale of our findlay facility in september  we have discontinued the production of automotive products and do not expect the revenue from this product line to be material in fiscal year during the first three quarters of  the semiconductor industry experienced a downturn in demand 
since that time  the industry has stabilized  but has yet to see a meaningful recovery 
despite a weak industry  we continue to gain market share in desktop and notebook power regulators 
in addition  the wireless networking market grew significantly from the third quarter of to the third quarter of however  in the fourth quarter of  wireless networking experienced customer requested delayed shipments  which caused their revenue to decline sequentially 
due to the addition of elantec  the second quarter of fiscal year includes some changes which inhibit the comparability to previous quarters 
the change in our revenue recognition policy for sales to north american distributors reduced the revenues of power management  standard analog and wireless networking in the second quarter of by million  million and million  respectively 
effective march   
table of contents we began to recognize revenue to north american distributors on a sell through basis 
as such  we now recognize sales to north american distributors upon shipment to the end customer 
formerly  we recognized revenue from north american distributor sales upon shipment to the distributors 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the following table sets forth statement of operations data in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated year ended year ended january  december  january  december  in thousands revenue power management elantec standard analog wireless networking automotive total costs and expenses cost of product sales research and development selling  general and administrative amortization in process research and development impairment of long lived assets restructuring operating income loss interest  net loss on investments gain loss before sales of certain operations  income taxes and extraordinary item operating results of certain operations disposed of during net sales costs and expenses gain on sale of certain operations income before income taxes and extraordinary item income taxes income before extraordinary item extraordinary item loss on extinguishment of debt  net of tax effect net income loss note percentages may not add due to rounding 

table of contents revenue revenue from continuing operations for the weeks ended january  increased to million from million during the weeks ended december  the increase resulted primarily from the continued growth in demand for our wireless networking prism wlan solutions as well as market share gains by our power management products during also  the addition of elantec contributed million in revenue for the weeks ended january  geographically   and of product sales were derived in asia pacific  north america and europe  respectively  during the weeks ended january  compared to  and during the weeks ended december  as discussed above  we changed our revenue recognition for sales to north american distributors and as a result  the percentage of sales attributable to north american customers decreased in the second quarter of we continue to see a shift in demand to the asia pacific region 
gross profit cost of product sales consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with product manufacturing  plus licensing  warranty and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to products sold 
in the weeks ended january  gross profit on product sales increased to million from million in the weeks ended december  as a percentage of sales  gross margin was during the weeks ended january  compared to during the weeks ended december  this improvement in gross margins resulted from the closure of our findlay facility  cost reductions for raw materials and an increase in sales of our higher margin products 
in the quarter ended march   we recorded an inventory charge of million due to the exit of product lines and obsolescence related to changing market conditions 
the semiconductor industry has historically experienced declining selling prices over the past years  and we expect that trend to continue in the future 
however  we expect to realize a shift to higher margin products  productivity gains and material cost reductions that will substantially offset the decline in average selling prices and therefore do not anticipate a significant adverse effect on our financial condition 
research and development r d r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and costs of employees engaged in product process research  design and development activities  as well as related subcontracting activities  prototype development  cost of design tools and technology license agreement expenses 
r d expenses increased to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the weeks ended december  the acquisition of elantec and increased spending in power management were the two primary drivers for the increase 
we also continue to invest in wireless networking technologies 
as a percentage of sales  r d expenses decreased to for the weeks ended january  from for the weeks ended december  due to increased revenue in fiscal year in  we expect to continue to increase our spending in our primary growth engines 
selling  general and administrative sg a sg a costs  which include marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the weeks ended december  this increase is primarily due to the addition of elantec 
however  as a percentage of sales  sg a costs decreased to for the weeks ended january  from for the weeks ended december  we are progressing on the integration of the elantec acquisition and expect to see additional savings from synergies in 
table of contents amortization amortization of intangible assets and unearned compensation decreased to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the weeks ended december  the decrease was the result of the adoption of fas  which disallows the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived assets 
this decrease was partially offset by the additional amortization of unearned compensation resulting from the elantec merger 
definite lived assets are being amortized over their useful lives ranging from to years 
we expect amortization to be million during fiscal year of which will be from intangible assets 
currently  fas requires testing goodwill for impairment at least annually while checking for impairment indicators quarterly 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the value of each of our reporting units exceeded its book value 
therefore  no impairments were taken 
depending on the future market demand for our products  among other factors  we could experience an impairment on this balance 
restructuring and other charges as part of the merger with elantec  we accrued for restructuring activities relating to the consolidation of the combined entity s business operations 
the restructuring plans included the costs associated with the reduction in workforce and the exit of duplicate processes and locations 
as a result of the restructuring we recorded a charge of million million after tax during the quarter ended june  the plans included the exit of various sales offices and the termination of redundant distribution channels worldwide 
in march  the board of directors approved and we announced several major restructuring activities to improve ongoing operations and product gross margins 
the restructuring plans included the phased closure of our findlay  ohio manufacturing operation  the exit of the modem board assembly manufacturing process in scottsdale  arizona and the exit of the value added reseller s channel in europe for wireless access end products 
as a result of the restructuring  we recorded expenses of approximately million million after tax during the quarter ended march  benefits from these restructurings are being realized as each of the specific actions are completed in the form of reduced employee expenses  lower depreciation expense and lower operating costs

elantec designed  manufactured and marketed high performance analog solutions to manufacturers in the markets for video  optical 
table of contents storage  communications and power management products 
we entered into this merger to expand into additional high growth analog markets 
intersil and elantec also shared a significant number of customers and had complementary product portfolios 
the merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the results of operations of elantec have been included in our results since the merger date 
consideration for the merger with elantec consisted of cash  common stock and options to purchase common stock 
pursuant to the merger  each outstanding share of elantec common stock was converted into shares of our class a common stock and cash  without interest 
the source of funds for the cash portion of the purchase price was working capital 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we issued  shares of our class a common stock for of elantec s outstanding common stock 
this issuance had an impact of million shares on our basic and diluted outstanding share amounts  which are used for earnings per share purposes 
as a result of the merger  we incurred transaction related fees of million 
we also incurred costs of million relating to efforts undertaken to exit certain activities deployed by elantec 
finally  million of the purchase price was allocated to future periods in the form of unearned compensation  which resulted from the intrinsic value of the aforementioned options 
the unearned compensation costs will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of the options as expense in arriving at operating income 
the table below summarizes the components of the purchase price in millions common stock issued value of options issued cash paid transaction costs incurred exit costs incurred unearned compensation total purchase price the purchase price allocation  which is subject to change based on actual costs incurred  is as follows in millions tangible current assets tangible long term assets tangible liabilities developed technology acquired in process research and development goodwill deferred tax liability tax benefit from exercise of vested options total purchase price included in the purchase price of the elantec merger are million in accrued costs arising out of our plan to exit certain activities deployed by elantec 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination or eitf  these costs were considered in the purchase price allocation of the elantec merger 
the restructuring plan includes termination benefits and other costs incurred in our exit of elantec s fabrication facility in milpitas  california and the elimination of certain elantec sales and marketing activities 
the restructuring plan was formalized in may  and is currently funded from working capital as intended by the plan 
as a result of the merger  elantec employees were notified that their employment would be terminated and of the specifics of their severance 
table of contents benefits 
as of january  approximately of the affected employees had been terminated 
the remaining employees will be terminated over the next six months 
benefits from these restructurings will be realized as each of the specific actions are completed in the form of reduced employee expenses  lower depreciation expense and lower operating costs 
during fiscal year  we estimate the cost savings of the restructuring plan to be approximately to million 
a summary of the restructuring costs and the remaining accrual follows additions utilization balance january  in millions employee termination costs milpitas plant closure costs sales office closure costs total restructuring costs employee termination costs as a result of the acquisition of elantec  intersil employees were notified that their employment would be terminated and of the specifics of their severance benefits 
these positions included primarily selling employees of whom were located in the united states  in europe and in asia 
as of january   approximately of the affected employees had been terminated 
the remaining employees will be terminated over the next three months 
in connection with the march announced restructurings  approximately employees were notified that their employment would be terminated and of the specifics of their severance benefits 
those positions included manufacturing  selling and general and administrative employees with of the employees being located in the united states and in europe 
the sale of the findlay  ohio manufacturing operation was completed late in september as of january   all of the affected employees had been terminated 
other exit costs other exit costs include costs to decommission removal of semiconductor specific equipment and leasehold improvements the findlay site to a marketable condition 
in the quarter ended march   we wrote off million of intangible assets as well as other miscellaneous assets attributable to the exit of the modem board assembly manufacturing process 
we terminated some existing contracts in connection with the planned exit of the modem board assembly manufacturing process and recognized the associated termination costs as part of this restructuring 
the integration of elantec resulted in the termination of several lease commitments as well as obligations with external sales representatives 
impairment of long lived assets in connection with the closure of the findlay  ohio manufacturing operation  we recorded an impairment of million million after tax in property  plant and equipment during the quarter ended march  the impairment was determined by comparing the carrying value of the assets to an appraised value on the land  equipment and buildings and the expected future undiscounted net cash flows from the equipment to be disposed 
during the quarter ended june   we recorded an additional impairment of million million after tax on these assets as determined by the contractual sales price 
the sale of the operation was completed during the quarter ended october  
table of contents gain loss on investments during the quarter ended june   we recorded an impairment charge of million million after tax related to an investment contained within the other long term asset section of the balance sheets 
as we hold less than equity ownership with no indicators of influence in the investee and the shares are not readily traded on a major stock exchange  this investment was held at cost 
the impairment reflects the excess of the investment s carrying value over the estimated undiscounted cash flows resulting from the eventual disposal of the securities 
also  during the quarter ended june   we recorded a gain of million million after tax from the sale of our investment in powersmart  inc the gain was calculated as the excess of the proceeds from disposition of the investment over the carrying value 
marketable securities consist of shares of chippac  inc chippac common stock that have been classified as investments on the balance sheet 
they are recorded at fair value  which is determined based on quoted market prices 
during the quarter ended march   we recorded an impairment charge of million million after tax related to our investment in chippac common stock which reflected an other than temporary decline in value based on two consecutive quarters where the quoted market price was less than the carrying value 
as of january  we carried an unrealized loss on the investment of million  before taxes 
this loss is currently deemed temporary given the recent trading prices of the stock as well as other qualitative characteristics considered by our management 
we will continue to monitor the stock price and should the market value remain significantly below our carrying value  we may take an additional impairment 
gain on sale of certain operations on march   we sold the assets of our discrete power products group to fairchild semiconductor corporation fairchild for million in cash and the assumption by fairchild of certain liabilities of the product group 
as a result of the sale  we recognized a gain of million million after tax  which was net of the assets purchased and liabilities assumed by fairchild  transaction fees and other exit costs associated with the sale 
the exit costs include employee termination benefits incurred within one year from the sale date 
at the date of the sale  fairchild made offers of employment to a portion of our employees who supported the discrete power products group 
approximately employees who were not offered jobs with fairchild or who did not accept an employment offer were notified that their employment would be terminated and of the specifics of their severance benefits 
those positions included manufacturing  selling and general and administrative employees with of the employees being located in the united states  in europe and in asia 
all of the affected employees have been terminated 
other exit costs included information technology costs required to cover transferred software license fees and system modifications necessary to support the business transition activity 
we wrote off million of intangible assets as well as other miscellaneous assets attributable to the discrete power products group 
we also closed three foreign sales offices as a result of the sale 
in process research and development in connection with the merger with elantec in may  we allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the in process research and development had no alternative future uses and did not otherwise qualify for capitalization 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as a one time charge to earnings in the quarter ended june  
table of contents in making the purchase price allocation  we relied on present value calculations of income  an analysis of project accomplishments and completion costs and an assessment of overall contribution and project risk 
the present value was determined by discounting to years of after tax cash flow projections depending on the individual project 
we used a discount rate of based on an approximation of the cost of capital 
the percentage of completion for the projects ranges from to  and the total cost to complete all projects is approximately million 
we estimate that all projects will be complete by the third quarter of fiscal year the various project groupings  the cost to complete the projects and the average percentage complete within each grouping are reported below project group number of projects cost to complete average percent complete value assigned to project optical storage communications dc dc converters amplifiers and comparators other video tft buffers total these estimates  which were developed by an independent third party  are subject to change given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
we expect to continue these development efforts and believe we have a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and development programs 
however  there is risk associated with the completion of the projects and there is no assurance that any will meet either technological or commercial success 
interest income expense interest income decreased to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the weeks ended december  the decrease was due to a decrease in short term interest rates during fiscal years and interest expense also decreased to million for the weeks ended january  from million for the weeks ended december  this decrease was due to the elimination of our long term debt during the first quarter of fiscal year tax expense the tax provision for the weeks ended january  differs from the tax provision for the weeks ended december  due to the gain generated from the sale of our discrete power products group and the other restructuring activities that were recorded during the first quarter of fiscal year as well as the write off of in process r d in fiscal year we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately to for fiscal year extraordinary item during the quarter ended march   we tendered all million of our outstanding senior subordinated notes in the open market

table of contents critical accounting policies in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have selected our more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimates  in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimates  and the possible effects on the company s financial condition 
the four accounting estimation processes discussed below are the allowance for collection losses on trade receivables  reserves for excess or obsolete inventory  distributor reserves and tax valuation allowance 
these estimation processes affect current assets and liabilities and are therefore critical in assessing the financial and operating status of the company 
these estimates involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create an adverse impact on the company s operations and financial position 
the allowance for collection losses on trade receivables was million on gross trade receivables of million at january  this allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables as of january  as the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding as of january  can not be known with exact certainty as of this document s effective date  we rely primarily on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have been typically infrequent with write offs of trade receivables being less than of sales 
we maintain a general allowance of approximately of a gross trade receivable balance in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not indicate the inability to pay but will have such an inability 
we also maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible due to various reasons such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify those accounts that are more likely to have collection problems 
we then reserve a portion or all of the customer s balance 
the reserve for excess or obsolete inventory was million at january  the reserve for excess or obsolete inventory is used to state our inventories at the lower of standard cost or market as described in the footnotes to the financial statements 
as the amount of inventoriable costs that we will truly recoup through sales on our inventory levels as of january  can not be known with exact certainty as of this document s effective date  we rely on past sales experience and future sales forecasts 
in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify inventory as either excess or obsolete 
we classify inventory as obsolete if we have withdrawn it from the marketplace or if we have had no sales of the product for the past months and no sales forecasted for the next months 
we reserve of the standard cost of obsolete inventory 
we classify inventory as excess if we have quantities of product greater than the amounts we have sold in the past months or have forecasted to sell in the next months 
we reserve approximately of the standard cost of the excess inventory 
we believe that represents the value of excess inventory we would not be able to recover due to our new product next generation introductions and other technological advancements 
distributor reserves were million at january  revenue is recognized from sales to all other customers  excluding north american distributors  when a product is shipped 
sales to international distributors are made under agreements  which provide the distributors certain price protection on and rights to periodically exchange a percentage of unsold inventory they hold 
accordingly  distributor reserves are amounts within the liability section of the balance sheet that estimate the amount of inventory adjustments that will be encountered in the future on the inventory that is held by international distributors as of the balance sheet date 
as the amount of inventory held by international distributors as of january  that will be adjusted in the future cannot be known with certainty as of the date hereof  the company relies primarily on historical international distributor transactions 
the international distributor reserves comprise two components that are reasonably estimable 
the first component of international distributor reserves is the price protection reserve  which protects the distributors gross margins in the event of falling prices 
this reserve is based on the relationship of historical credits issued to distributors in relation to historical inventory levels and price paid by the distributor as applied to current inventory levels 
the second component is a stock rotation reserve  which is based on the percentage of sales made to certain distributors in europe whereby the distributors can periodically exchange a percentage of 
table of contents older inventories with newer products 
actual price protection and stock rotation changes have historically been within management s expectations 
international distributor reserves are combined with other product return reserves within the sales reserves line item on the balance sheet 
these other product return reserves arise from the return of shipments in which the parts had not been returned by year end 
these other product return reserves amounted to million at january  effective march   we began to recognize revenue to north american distributors on a sell through basis 
as such  we now recognize sales to north american distributors upon shipment to the end customer 
formerly  we recognized revenue from north american distributor sales upon shipment to the distributors 
the combination of the changes resulting from the integration with elantec  changes in the distributor mix and changes in market pricing affect the estimability of customer acceptance 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
at january   our net deferred tax asset amounted to million 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the provisions of sfas require companies to record an asset and related liability for the costs associated with the retirement of a long lived tangible asset if a legal liability to retire the asset exists 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe this statement will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas will generally require gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under sfas extraordinary treatment will be required for certain extinguishments as provided in apb opinion no 
the statement also amended sfas for certain sales leaseback transactions and sublease accounting 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas effective january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when a liability is incurred rather than when an exit or disposal plan is approved 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas for any exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the effect of adoption of sfas will be a change on a prospective basis of the timing of when restructuring charges are recorded from a commitment date approach to when a liability is recorded 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 

table of contents the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for interim and annual periods after december  the initial recognition and initial measurement requirements of this interpretation are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after december  the interpretation s expanded disclosures will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we are assessing  but at this point do not believe the adoption of the recognition and initial measurement requirements of this interpretation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no

in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after december   and are included in note s to the consolidated financial statements 
the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we have not completed the assessment as to whether the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fas issued fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
under current practice  two enterprises generally have been included in consolidated financial statements because one enterprise controls the other through voting interests 
this interpretation defines the concept of variable interests and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse the risks among the parties involved 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  if it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity when this interpretation becomes effective  the enterprise shall disclose information about those entities in all financial statements issued after january  the interpretation may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
based on the recent release of this interpretation  we have not completed our assessment as to whether or not the adoption of this interpretation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
subsequent events on january   we announced a restructuring plan designed to further streamline the workforce and reduce costs 
this restructuring initiative was accounted for under the provisions of sfas the total cost of the plan will be approximately million  which represents severance payments and outplacement related services 
in accordance with sfas  the severance related liability was recognized at the time the plan was communicated to employees as no service was required to obtain the benefits  while the liability related to the outplacement services is to be recognized upon receipt of the services 
the plan affects employees  of which are located in the united states with the remainder in europe 
additionally  in the first quarter of  we expect to release approximately million of exit cost reserves which are located in the short term liability section of the balance sheet at january  these reserves were established in relation to the sale of the discrete power product group 
on march   we announced the settlement of the litigation arising from the alleged infringement with proxim 
the terms of the confidential settlement require us to make a one time cash payment and provide a

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we  in the normal course of doing business  are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments  entered into for purposes other than trading purposes  to manage our exposure to these risks 
at january   we had open foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of million  which was to hedge forecasted foreign cash flow commitments up to six months 
as hedges on forecasted foreign cash flow commitments do not qualify for deferral  gains and losses on changes in the fair market value of the foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income 
total net losses on foreign exchange contracts for the weeks ended january  were million 
during the weeks ended january   we purchased and sold million of foreign exchange forward contracts 
the derivatives were also recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value  which was nominal  at january  the table below summarizes our foreign exchange contract activity over the past two years in millions weeks ended december  weeks ended january  gain loss on foreign exchange contracts purchases and sales of foreign exchange contracts notional amount of open contracts at year end fair value of open contracts at year end the merger with elantec and our increased sales volume in asia are the primary factors for the increase in the purchases and sales of foreign exchange contracts 
our hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs include accuracy of sales estimates  volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments 
a adverse change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives held at january  would have an impact of approximately million on the fair values of these instruments 
this qualification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair values of foreign denominated assets  liabilities and firm commitments
