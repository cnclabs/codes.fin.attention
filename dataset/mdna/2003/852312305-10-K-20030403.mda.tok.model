item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained in this annual report  the matters discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements  the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from the discussion of such matters in the forward looking statements 
see factors that may affect future results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in the company s income statement for the period indicated and the percentage increase or decrease in such items over the prior period 
percentage of total revenues percentage change january  december  december  vs 
vs 
total revenues cost of sales gross profit costs and expenses general and administrative marketing and selling research and development other charges total costs and expenses operating loss other expense  net loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit minority interest net loss fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues for the year ended january  decreased over the year ended december  by or  the decrease in revenues was due primarily to a decrease in iol sales primarily in the united states 
approximately of the decrease in iol sales was the result of a decline in unit volume and of the decrease was the result of a decline in average selling price asp 
the decrease in iol sales were partially offset by an increase in sales in international markets of distributed products and a increase in icl sales 
unit volume of icls increased  partially offset by a decline in asp 
sales of staarvisc increased on increased volume and aquaflow sales increased on increased volume and asp 
the company expects sales of iols in the us to increase in as a result of tighter management of the company s independent sales force and the introduction of improved lens delivery systems 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended january  was of revenues compared to the year ended december  when it was of revenues including other charges of million related to inventory write offs primarily as the result of voluntary product recalls 
excluding the other charges  gross profit for the year ended december  was 
the lower gross profit for the current year compared to the previous year excluding other charges is due to the high unit costs of iol inventory manufactured last year during a period of low production volumes 
gross profit for the year was also impacted by a shift in product mix from iols with a higher gross profit margin to equipment and other distributed product with a lower gross profit margin 
gross profit margin has improved sequentially each quarter since the second quarter of the company expects gross profit to continue to improve as the high cost inventory is depleted and the company s strategy to improve efficiency yields additional cost savings 
marketing and selling expenses 
marketing and selling expenses for the year ended january  were of revenues compared to of revenues for the year ended december  in terms of dollars  marketing and selling expenses for decreased million or over due to cost containment measures which have reduced overall spending in the us and the approximate million in cost savings the company has realized as a result of subsidiary closures in the previous year 
other charges 
other charges for the year ended january  were approximately million compared to the year ended december  when other charges were million 
the million in charges taken during related to the recognition of deferred losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency statements into us dollars of subsidiaries that were closed and employee separation 
other expense  net 
other expense  net for the year ended january  increased  over the year ended december  this increase was due to decreased income from the company s joint venture with canon staar  decreased interest income  and increased foreign exchange losses 
income taxes 
during the year ended january   the company recorded a valuation allowance of million against its deferred tax assets 
this non cash charge reduced the deferred tax assets on the balance sheet to zero 
the assets were created as a result of income tax benefits that were recorded on us operating losses incurred during the restructuring and reorganization accomplished in and no deferred tax benefits were recorded on operating losses in current accounting standards place significant weight on a history of recent cumulative losses in determining whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary 
forecasts of future taxable income are not considered sufficient positive evidence to outweigh a history of losses 
accordingly  the assets were reserved in full 
the company s federal net operating loss carryforwards are not impacted and can continue to be utilized for up to years 
legislation enacted on march  hr enabled the company to carryback a portion of the federal net operating loss to  and since this legislation was not enacted as of the end of fiscal year  the benefit of  from this carryback was recorded in fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing a decrease over the million in revenues for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues resulted primarily due to decreased sales of the company s elastic tm and elastimide tm silicone intraocular lenses due to the impact of a voluntary product recall in the second quarter of the decrease in silicone iol sales was partially offset by increased sales of the company s collamer  toric  and acrylic iols 
the company experienced a continued shift in product mix in fiscal revenues also decreased in for sales in of subsidiaries that were closed in the same year and sales of the company s sonicwave phacoemulsification system also decreased 
this decrease was due to the elimination of a dedicated sales force as a result of cost containment measures taken during fiscal and a general decline in the economy resulting in a decline in capital equipment spending 
in addition to increased sales of collamer  toric and acrylic iols  sales of the company s aquaflow device  which was approved for sale in the united states in the third quarter of fiscal and staarvisc ii also increased 
the company is expanding its market focus beyond the cataract market to also include the refractive and glaucoma markets 
the company anticipates that its growth in the refractive and glaucoma product markets will increase significantly as the company s refractive lenses icl and toric iol and its aquaflow device continue to gain market acceptance and regulatory approvals 
the company believes its sales of products used for the treatment of cataracts will grow with the introduction or reintroduction of various products including the collamer three piece iol  staarvisc ii  ultravac v tubing and the sonicwave phacoemulsification system 
cost of sales 
cost of sales were million or of revenue for the year ended december  compared to million or of revenue for the year ended december  the increase in cost of sales resulted from a increase in inventory write offs over the prior year  primarily relating to voluntary product recalls 
excluding the impact of inventory write offs  cost of sales as a percent of revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased unit costs of silicone iols and a change in product mix 
silicone iol unit costs increased significantly due to lower production levels necessitated by reduced sales demand and improved inventory management 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  or of revenue  as compared to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase as a percent of revenue was due to decreased revenues 
the slight increase in dollars is primarily attributable to relocation costs of executive management  increased administrative salaries  and increased professional fees offset by decreased expenses from a subsidiary that was closed in the prior year 
marketing and selling 
marketing and selling expense for the year ended december  was million or of revenue  as compared to million or of revenue for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase as a percent of revenue was due to decreased revenues 
actual expense decreased by million due to decreased commissions  decreased costs from a subsidiary that was closed in fiscal and cost containment measures taken during fiscal research and development 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was million  or of revenue as compared to million or of revenue for the year ended december  research and development expense decreased over the prior year due primarily to decreased staffing during the first six months of other charges 
in june management completed an extensive operational review of the company 
based upon that review  in august the company implemented a plan that management believes will allow it to become profitable 
as a result of implementing the plan  the company significantly changed its manufacturing processes and locations  including consolidating lathing activity into the swiss manufacturing site from the current dual site operations and reducing molded lens capacity at the california site 
the company also reduced its workforce and closed certain overseas operations 
in conjunction with the implementation of the plan  the company recorded pretax charges of approximately million in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
planned charges included approximately million in fixed asset write offs  million in severance and employee relocation costs  and million for subsidiary closures 
additionally  the company reserved million of notes receivable from former officers and directors of the company and paid million for the early termination of a consulting contract with the president of one of the company s european subsidiaries 
the company also wrote off million of inventory related to voluntary product recalls and excess and obsolete inventory in the second and fourth quarters of the amount is included in cost of sales at december  other expense  net 
other expense  net for the year ended december  was approximately million or of revenues as compared to approximately million or of revenues for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from decreased interest expense and amounts written off in fiscal related to the company s joint venture with canon staar co  inc income tax benefit 
the income tax benefit was million for the year ended december  as compared to a benefit of million for the year ended december  the primary reason for this decrease relates to decreased us losses over the prior fiscal year resulting in a lower overall tax benefit 
the tax benefit for fiscal was further reduced by approximately million in valuation allowances that were recorded against the company s deferred tax assets 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an decrease over the million in revenues for the year ended december  the primary reasons for the decrease in revenues were the reduced us dollar amounts recorded by international subsidiaries due to the strength of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  most specifically the german mark  decreased sales to the company s joint venture  canon staar company  inc  the continuing decline in sales of the company s silicone iols in europe and lower average selling prices on international sales of the company s icls due to the change from direct selling to selling through international distributors 
these decreases were offset by increased sales of the sonicwave phacoemulsification system  which was introduced in the third quarter  increased revenue from the sales of the collamer single piece iol  approved for sale in april  increased revenues from sales of the toric iol and increased revenues from a full year of sales of custom surgical packs to our us customers  which began in mid year other revenue in increased over by  cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to of revenue for the year ended december  from of revenue for the year ended december  the primary reasons for this increase relates to an inventory write off of million  recorded during the second quarter of  of various items that no longer fit the company s future direction 
additionally  despite higher average selling prices for iols  higher average unit cost caused the cost of sales as a percentage of revenue exclusive of the above mentioned write off to increase slightly to 
the increase in average selling price was due to the change in product mix to the company s premium priced iols toric and collamer 
the higher average cost of iols was due principally to the changes in product mix to the collamer iol and  to a lesser extent  increased unit cost due to lower manufacturing activity levels which resulted in the units produced carrying a higher per unit cost from absorption of fixed expenses 
additionally  the full year of sales of custom surgical packs in the us have a higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales when compared to the other products the company offers 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  or of revenue  as compared to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  this increase in dollars was primarily attributable to increases in expenditures for professional service fees  expenses recorded in the second quarter at the time of the company s restructuring plan  and increased expenses year over year from subsidiaries acquired or created in late the increase as a percent of revenues was due to the expenses increasing at a rate greater than the current growth rate of revenues 
marketing and selling 
marketing and selling expense for the year ended december  was million or of revenue  as compared to million or of revenue for the year ended december  the primary reasons for this increase was the compensation and travel costs of direct sales management hired in late and to sell iols and the company s sonicwave phacoemulsification systems  increased commissions generated by the graduated commission schedule which has higher percentage rates as iol sales prices increase  and average selling price increases over due to the change in iol mix to the company s proprietary iols 
additionally  the company has continued to increase the expenses for product management to prepare for broader entry into the refractive and glaucoma markets 
these increases were offset  in part  as a result of the reduced us dollar amounts recorded by international subsidiaries due to the strength of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  most specifically  the german mark 
research and development 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was million  or of revenue as compared to million or of revenue for the year ended december  research and development expense decreased slightly over the prior year due to a reduction in research and development staffing offset by increased spending related to the monitoring of clinical trials for the icl for the correction of myopia  the icl for the correction of hyperopia  and the aquaflow device 
additionally  expenses relating to the development and improvement of the company s sonicwave phacoemulsification system increased 
other charges

other expense  net 
other expense  net for the year ended december  was approximately million or of revenues as compared to approximately million or of revenues for the prior year 
the primary reason for this increase was a million charge the company recorded relating to the write off of its japanese joint venture 
income tax provision 
income tax benefit was million for the year ended december  as compared to a provision of million for the year ended december  the reasons for the change relate to the dramatic reduction in income before income taxes  which was due primarily to the charges taken in the second quarter totaling million before income taxes 
during  the company recorded a deferred tax asset that resulted from the losses recorded for the year 
the company would have been profitable in the fiscal year with the exclusion of charges relating to the restructuring plan and the reserve for notes receivable 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its activities over the past several years principally from cash flow generated from operations  credit facilities provided by institutional domestic and foreign lenders  the private placement of common stock and the exercise of stock options and warrants 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively

day s inventory on hand decreased from days in  to days in  to days in decreases in inventory in and totaling million and million  respectively  were the result of write offs of excess and obsolete inventory and inventory related to voluntary product recalls 
the decrease in inventory in was partially offset by higher cost inventory that was produced during the year as a result of decreased production volume 
this high cost inventory was sold during and replaced with lower cost inventory resulting in an overall decrease in inventory of million over the company expects that for  the value of its inventory will remain approximately million and that the trend of decreasing inventory will not continue 
accounts payable in   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the decreases in and were the result of companywide cost savings measures implemented during those years 
the benefits of those cost savings measures continued into however  the decrease at january  is principally due to plant shutdowns during the christmas holidays which resulted in a change in the timing of payments 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately   and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the principal investments of the company are in property and equipment 
investments in property and equipment were  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the investments are generally made to upgrade and improve existing production equipment and processes 
in fiscal  additional expenditures were made to set up or expand production facilities in the us and in switzerland for new products 
the company expects to spend approximately million on property and equipment in net cash used in provided by financing activities were approximately  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the company had a million line of credit with a domestic lender which matured on march   and was amended and restated from time to time during the year ended january  the line of credit  as modified  extends the maturity date to march   included the release of restricted cash in the amount of million in order to pay down the note and provides for monthly decreases in availability through february totaling million 
the company s obligation to the lender is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the company s assets and bears interest at a rate equal to the prime rate at january  plus an applicable interest margin from to which is based on the company s ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda at each fiscal quarter on a trailing month basis 
in addition  the company is required to pay a commitment fee 
to of the unused amount of the line of credit also based on a ratio of funded debt to ebitda 
since the company reported losses throughout  it was charged the maximum total interest rate allowed under the agreement of prime plus a margin and the maximum commitment fee of at january  the agreement also requires the company to satisfy certain financial tests  which include positive and negative covenants such as the maintenance of certain levels of liquidity  operating cash flows  tangible net worth  and operating income

the decision of any one of the company s lenders not to renew its line of credit could have a material adverse affect on the company and the costs associated with obtaining alternate financing could be significant 
critical accounting policies the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies 

revenue recognition 
in general  the company supplies foldable iols on a consignment basis to customers  primarily ophthalmologists  surgical centers  hospitals and other eye care providers and recognizes sales when the iols are implanted 
sales of all other products  including sales to foreign distributors  are generally recognized upon shipment 
revenue from license and technology agreements is recorded as income  when earned  according to the terms of the respective agreements 

impairment of long lived assets 
intangible and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance  plant closures  product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in reviewing for impairment  the company compares the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than their carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the assets fair value and their carrying value 
goodwill  which has an indefinite life and was previously amortized on a straight line basis over the periods benefited  is no longer amortized to earnings  but instead is subject to periodic testing for impairment 
intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their remaining useful lives 
goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment on an annual basis or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
as provided under sfas  the initial testing of goodwill for possible impairment was completed within the first six months of and no impairment has been identified 
as of january   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
the company also has other intangible assets consisting of patents and licenses  with a gross book value of million and accumulated amortization of million as of january  the company capitalizes the costs of acquiring patents and licenses as well as the legal costs of successfully defending its rights to these patents 
amortization is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are based on legal and contractual provisions  and range from to years 

deferred taxes 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities along with net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset may not be realized 
the impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and laws  if any  are applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled and reflected in the financial statements in the period of enactment 
in  due to the company s recent history of losses  an increase to the valuation allowance was recorded as a non cash charge to tax expense in the amount of million 
as a result  the valuation allowance fully offsets the value of deferred tax assets on the company s balance sheet as of january  if in the future  the company determines it will be able to utilize all or part of the deferred tax assets which have a valuation allowance of million at january   we would reverse the valuation allowance  which would result in an income tax benefit 
factors that may affect future results of operations our short and long term success is subject to many factors that are beyond our control 
stockholders and prospective stockholders in the company should consider carefully the following risk factors  in addition to other information contained in this report 
this annual report on form l k contains forward looking statements  which are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth below 
the company may not be able to fund its future growth or react to competitive pressures if it lacks sufficient funds 
the company depends on external sources banks and capital markets for the funding it needs to operate the business 
unexpected conditions have arisen and can continue to arise that could cause the company to be in violation of its lender s financial covenants 
the company believes it has sufficient cash available through its bank credit facilities and cash from operations to fund existing operations and that it could obtain alternate financing  if necessary  although this is not certain 
the decision of any one of the company s lenders not to renew its line of credit could have a material adverse affect on the company and the costs associated with obtaining alternate financing could be significant 
we have a history of losses 
we have reported losses in each of the last three fiscal years and have an accumulated deficit of million as of january  if losses from operations continue  they could adversely affect the market price for our common stock  and our ability to maintain existing financing and obtain new financing 
despite our restructuring efforts  there can be no assurance that we will receive the intended benefits from these changes or that we will be successful in restoring the profitability of the company 
we risk losses through litigation 
we are party to various claims and legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of our business 
these claims and legal proceedings relate to contractual rights and obligations  employment matters  stockholder suits  and claims of product liability 
while there can be no assurance that an adverse determination of any such matters could not have a material adverse impact in any future period  we do not believe  based upon information known to us  that the final resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position or results of operations and cash flows 
we have been in default of the terms of our domestic loans and have been required to reduce our principal balances  limiting our access to credit 
during recent periods  we have failed to comply with some of the covenants in our principal domestic loan  including covenants that we maintain minimum levels of operating income  cash flow and tangible net worth 
accordingly  we have had to seek waivers from our lender or modifications of our lending agreement 
among other things  we have agreed to monthly reductions of the balance of our principal domestic loan which reduces it from million to million when it is due on march  as of january   the principal balance of the loan was approximately million 
if we fail to meet the covenants in our loans in the future  we may not be able to secure further waivers or amendments from our lenders  who may instead seek payment on their loans and  if we fail to pay  to foreclose on the collateral for their loans 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets as security for our existing loans 
our collateral pledge may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on advantageous terms  if at all 
if we fail to keep pace with advances in our industry or fail to persuade physicians to adopt the new products we introduce  customers may not buy our products and our revenue may decline 
constant development of new technologies and techniques  frequent new product introductions and strong price competition characterize the ophthalmic industry 
the first company to introduce a product to market usually gains a significant competitive advantage 
our future growth depends  in part  on our ability to develop products to treat diseases and disorders of the eye that are more effective  safer  or incorporate emerging technologies better than our competitors products 
in addition  we must manufacture these products economically and market them successfully by persuading a sufficient number of eye care professionals to use them 
for example  glaucoma requires ongoing treatment over a long period of time  thus  many doctors are reluctant to switch a patient to a new treatment if the patient s current treatment for glaucoma remains effective 
sales of our existing products may decline rapidly if one of our competitors introduces a substantially superior product  or if we announce a new product of our own 
similarly  if we fail to make sufficient investments in research and development or if we focus on technologies that do not lead to better products  our current and planned products could be surpassed by more effective or advanced products 
resources devoted to research and development may not yield new products that achieve commercial success 
we devote substantial resources to research and development 
the research and development process is expensive  prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty 
development of new implantable technology  from discovery through testing and registration to initial product launch  typically takes between three and seven years 
this period varies considerably from product to product and country to country 
because of the complexities and uncertainties associated with ophthalmic research and development  products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required for us to market such products successfully 
these may take longer and cost more to develop and may be less successful than we currently anticipate 
it is possible that few or none of the products in our development pipeline will become commercially successful 
failure of users of our products to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors could limit market acceptance of our products  which could impact our sales and profits 
many of our products  in particular iols and products related to the treatment of glaucoma  are used in procedures that are typically covered by health insurance  hmo plans  medicare or medicaid 
these third party payors have recently been trying to contain costs by restricting the types of procedures they reimburse to those viewed as most cost effective and capping or reducing reimbursement rates 
these polices could adversely affect sales and prices of our products 
physicians  hospitals and other health care providers may be reluctant to purchase our products if third party payors do not adequately reimburse them for the cost of our products and the use of our surgical equipment 
for example 
major third party payors for hospital services  including government insurance plans  medicare  medicaid and private health care insurers  have substantially revised their payment methodologies during the last few years  resulting in stricter standards for reimbursement of hospital and outpatient charges for some medical procedures  including cataract procedures and iols  
numerous legislative proposals have been considered that  if enacted  would result in major reforms in the united states health care system  which could have an adverse effect on our business  
our competitors may reduce the prices of their products  which could result in third party payors favoring our competitors  
there are proposed and existing laws and regulations governing product prices and the profitability of companies in the health care industry  and 
there have been recent initiatives by third party payors to challenge the prices charged for medical products  which could affect our profitability 
reductions in the prices for our products in response to these trends could reduce our profits 
moreover  our products may not be covered in the future by third party payors 
the failure of our products to be so covered could cause our profits to decline 
economic conditions and price competition may cause sales of our products used in elective surgical procedures to decline and reduce our profitability 
some of our products are used in purely elective procedures 
for example  many patients with refractive errors that could be successfully treated with icls can also obtain satisfactory vision with eyeglasses or conventional contact lenses 
except in cases where icls offer the only acceptable outcome  it is likely that insurers  hmos and government payors generally will not pay for icl implantation and that the patient will bear the full cost of the procedure 
individuals may be less willing to incur the costs of these procedures in weak or uncertain economic conditions  which could lead to a decline in the number of these procedures 
product recalls have been costly and may be so in the future 
implantable medical devices must be manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances  and often incorporate newly developed technology 
despite all efforts at quality control and advance testing  from time to time defects or technical flaws in our products may not come to light until after the products are sold or consigned 
in such circumstances  the company has previously made voluntary recalls of its products 
such voluntary recalls may take place again in the future 
mandatory recalls can also take place if regulators or courts require them  even if the company believes its products are safe and effective 
recalls result in lost sales of the recalled products themselves  and can result in further lost sales while replacement products are manufactured  especially if the replacements must be redesigned 
if recalled products have already been implanted  we may bear some or all of the cost of corrective surgery 
recalls also damage our reputation 
the inconvenience caused by recalls and related interruptions in supply  and the damage to our reputation  could cause some providers to discontinue using our products 
the costs of recalls have severely impacted our revenues in recent periods 
we are subject to extensive government regulation  which increases our costs and could prevent us from selling our products 
the research  development  testing  manufacturing and marketing of our products are subject to extensive governmental regulation 
government regulation includes inspection of and controls over testing  manufacturing  safety and environmental controls  efficacy  labeling  advertising  promotion  record keeping  the sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products and samples and electronic records and electronic signatures 
we are also subject to government regulation with respect to the prices we charge and the rebates we offer to customers 
government regulation substantially increases the cost of developing  manufacturing and selling our products 
in the united states  we must obtain approval from the fda for each product that we market 
the fda approval process is typically lengthy and expensive  and approval is never certain 
products distributed outside of the united states are also subject to government regulation  which may be equally or more demanding 
our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval 
if a regulatory authority delays approval of a potentially significant product  our market value and operating results may decline 
even if the fda or another regulatory agency approves a product  the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product  may otherwise limit our ability to promote  sell and distribute a product or may require post marketing studies 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of our products  we will not be able to market these products  which would result in a decrease in our sales 
currently  we are actively pursuing approval for a number of our products from regulatory authorities in a number of countries  including  among others  the united states  egypt  taiwan  china  and the united arab emirates 
continued growth in our sales and profits will depend  in part  on the timely and successful introduction and marketing of some or all of these products 
the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approvals are complex and expensive and their outcomes are uncertain 
we incur substantial expense for  and devote significant time to  clinical trials  yet cannot be certain that the trials will ever result in the commercial sale of a product 
positive results from pre clinical studies and early clinical trials do not ensure positive results in later clinical trials that form the basis of an application for regulatory approval 
we may suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials  even after earlier clinical trials show promising results 
any of our products may produce undesirable side effects that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials of a pharmaceutical or medical device candidate 
we  the fda or another regulatory authority may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time if they or we believe the trial participants face unacceptable health risks 
noncompliance with applicable united states regulatory requirements can lead to fines  injunctions  penalties  mandatory recalls or seizures  suspensions of production  denial or withdrawal of pre marketing approvals  recommendations by the fda against governmental contracts and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device we manufacture or distribute 
regulatory authorities outside of the united states may impose similar sanctions for noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
we face strong competition 
our competitors  including bausch lomb  amo  alcon  pharmacia upjohn  inc and ciba vision  have much greater financial resources than we do and some of them have large international markets for a full suite of ophthalmic products 
their greater resources for research  development and marketing  and their greater capacity to offer comprehensive products and equipment to providers  make it difficult for us to compete 
in recent periods  the company has lost significant market share to some of its competitors 
the global nature of our business may result in fluctuations and declines in our sales and profits 
our products are sold in more than countries 
revenues from international operations make up a significant portion of our total revenue  reaching for the year ended january  the results of operations and the financial position of our offshore operations are generally reported in the relevant local currencies and then translated into united states dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements  exposing us to translation risk 
in  our most significant currency exposures were to the euro  the swiss franc  and the australian dollar 
the exchange rates between these and other local currencies and the united states dollar may fluctuate substantially 
in addition  we are exposed to transaction risk because some of our expenses are incurred in a different currency from the currency in which our revenues are received 
fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar against other currencies have had in the past  and may have in the future  a material adverse effect on our operating margins and profitability 
economic  social and political conditions  laws  practices and local customs vary widely among the countries in which we sell our products 
our operations outside of the united states are subject to a number of risks and potential costs  including lower product margins  less stringent protection of intellectual property and economic  political and social uncertainty in some countries  especially in emerging markets 
our continued success as a global company depends  in part  on our ability to develop and implement policies and strategies that are effective in anticipating and managing these and other risks in the countries where we do business 
these and other risks may have a material adverse effect on our operations in any particular country and on our business as a whole 
we price all of our products in us dollars  and as a result changes in exchange rates can make our products more expensive in some offshore markets and reduce our revenues 
inflation in emerging markets also makes our products more expensive there and increases the credit risks to which we are exposed 
we have experienced currency fluctuations  inflation and volatile economic conditions  which have impacted our profitability in the past in several markets  including germany  austria  south africa  france  sweden  norway  canada and australia  and we may experience such impacts in the future 
we depend on proprietary technologies  but may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately 
we have numerous patents and pending patent applications 
we rely on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures and patent  trademark  copyright and trade secrecy laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
these legal measures afford limited protection and may not prevent our competitors from gaining access to our intellectual property and proprietary information 
any of our patents may be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that any pending patent application held by us will result in an issued patent or that if patents are issued to us  the patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or competitive technologies 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights 
any litigation could result in substantial expense  may reduce our profits and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
in addition  we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims covered by patents in our industry may involve complex legal issues that are not fully resolved 
any litigation or claims against us  whether or not successful  could result in substantial costs and harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following to cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which would adversely affect our revenue  to obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  or to redesign our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of a third party  which may be costly and time consuming or impossible to accomplish 
we obtain some of the components of our products from a single source  and an interruption in the supply of those components could reduce our revenue 
we obtain some of the components for our products from a single source 
the loss or interruption of any of these suppliers could cause our revenue and profitability to decline and harm our customer relations 
most of our products have single site manufacturing approvals  exposing us to risks of business interruption 
the validation of a second manufacturing site is expensive both in terms of time and money and  therefore  has not been done 
if there were to be a natural disaster  fire  or other serious business interruption at one of our manufacturing facilities  it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product 
we could lose customers to competitors  thereby reducing sales and profitability 
we may not successfully develop and launch replacements for our products that lose patent protection 
most of our products are covered by patents that give us a degree of market exclusivity during the term of the patent 
we also earn revenue by licensing some of our patented technology to other ophthalmic companies 
the legal life of a patent is years from application 
patents covering our products will expire within the next to years 
upon patent expiration  our competitors may introduce products using the same technology 
as a result of this possible increase in competition  we may need to charge a lower price in order to maintain sales of our products  which could make these products less profitable 
if we fail to develop and successfully launch new products prior to the expiration of patents for our existing products  our sales and profits with respect to those products could decline significantly 
we may not be able to develop and successfully launch more advanced replacement products before these and other patents expire 
the company depends on key employees 
the company depends on the continued service of its senior management and other key employees 
the loss of a key employee could hurt the business 
the company could be particularly hurt if key employees went to work for competitors 
the company s future success depends on its ability to identify  attract  train and motivate other highly skilled personnel 
failure to do so may adversely affect future results 
the company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay or prevent an acquisition or sale of the company 
the company s certificate of incorporation empowers the board of directors to establish and issue a class of preferred stock  and to determine the rights  preferences and privileges of the preferred stock 
this gives the board of directors the ability to deter  discourage or make more difficult a change in control of the company  even if such a change in control would be in the interest of a significant number of our stockholders or if such a change in control would provide our stockholders with a substantial premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price for the common stock 
the company s bylaws contain other provisions that could have an anti takeover effect  including the following 
only one of the three classes of directors is elected each year  
stockholders have limited ability to remove directors  
stockholders cannot call a special meeting of stockholders  and 
stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors 
anti takeover provisions of delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of the company 
the company is subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction 
they could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for the company s common stock or preventing changes in its management 
our activities involve hazardous materials and emissions and may subject us to environmental liability 
our manufacturing  research and development practices involve the controlled use of hazardous materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we have operations governing the use  manufacturing  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products 
although we believe that our safety and environmental procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
remedial environmental actions could require us to incur substantial unexpected costs  which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
if we were involved in a major environmental accident or found to be in substantial non compliance with applicable environmental laws  we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 
our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as quarterly variations in operating results  operating results which vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  changes in financial estimates  changes in market valuations of competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of a material nature  additions or departures of key personnel  future sales of common stock and stock volume fluctuations 
also  general political and economic conditions such as recession or interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our stock 
foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its suppliers or customers in the last three fiscal years has adversely affected the company s ability to purchase or sell products at agreed upon prices 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future  which would affect the company s operating results 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations during the past three years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manages its risks based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs 
management does not believe that market risks are material to the results of operations or cash flows of the company  and  accordingly  does not generally enter into interest rate or foreign exchange rate hedge instruments 
interest rate risk 
our million of debt is split between domestic borrowings of million and borrowings of our international subsidiaries of million 
our domestic borrowings are linked to the prime interest rate and  thus  our interest rate expense will fluctuate with rate changes in the us the majority of our international borrowings bear an interest rate that is linked to euro market conditions and  thus  our interest rate expense will fluctuate with changes in those conditions 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by for the year  our annual interest rate expense would increase or decrease by approximately  foreign currency risk 
our international subsidiaries operate in and are net recipients of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  we benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide euro and australian dollar 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and particularly the strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated sales and gross profit as expressed in us dollars 
additionally  approximately of our debt is denominated in swiss francs and as such  we are subject to fluctuations of the swiss franc as compared to the us dollar in converting the value of the debt in us dollars 
the us dollar value of the debt is increased by a weaker dollar and decreased by a stronger dollar relative to the swiss franc
