item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the financial section of this annual report consists of the following management s discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  and the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and the related notes 
the management s discussion section is designed to provide you with a narrative about our financial results 
our consolidated financial statements include an overview of our income and cash flow performance and financial position 
explanatory notes follow the consolidated financial statements 
among other things  the notes to our financial statements contain our accounting policies  detailed information on balances within the financial statements and certain contingencies and commitments 
we follow united states generally accepted accounting principles 
we have one reporting segment after the separation of our dsp core licensing business 
due to various applicable reporting and disclosure rules  a reader may be somewhat overwhelmed by the length and detail required for a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations 
therefore  the following overview is designed to provide you with some perspective regarding the information contained in this financial section  as well as a better understanding of the key drivers and concerns of our business 
our business model is relatively straightforward 
we are a fabless semiconductor company 
we develop  design  market and sell chip sets that incorporate technologies such as dsp processors  communications technologies  highly advanced rf devices and in house developed voip hardware and software technologies  to residential telephone equipment manufacturers 
as discussed earlier in the introduction to the business section of this annual report  in november  we transferred our dsp cores licensing business to ceva which thereafter combined with parthus and the combined company was renamed parthusceva 
the assets contributed to ceva included million in cash and prepaid transaction expenses related to the separation and combination that exceeded million  as well as fixed assets and other tangible assets related to the dsp cores licensing business 
this transfer of cash and assets is reflected in our financial statements as dividend in kind and was charged to our retained earnings in the amount of in anticipation of the consummation of the separation  as of june   we began to report the operating results of our dsp cores licensing business as discontinued operations 
the results of operations  including revenue  operating expenses  financial income and taxes on income of the dsp cores licensing business for the years ended december     and  have been reclassified in the accompanying statements of operations as discontinued operations 
our balance sheets at december      reflect the assets and the liabilities of the dsp cores licensing business as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations within current assets and liabilities 
thus  the financial information presented herein includes only the continued operations 
prior to the separation  we also generated revenues from software licensing  royalties and maintenance and support fees 
after the separation  we are a more focused fabless semiconductor business concentrating on product sales 
during the last five years  from to  our fabless semiconductor business model has produced million of revenues and million of net income from continuing operations  excluding revenues from the dsp cores licensing business 
we also achieved an increase of million in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities after the distribution of million in cash to ceva and other related payments in connection with the separation 
during recent years  we have become a worldwide leader in developing and marketing total telephony solutions for a wide range of applications for wireless residential markets 
the key factor that enabled us to grow our business over the previous years is our ability to combine and integrate our expertise in dsp core 
table of contents technology with proprietary advanced rf devices and communications technologies and speech processing algorithms 
the integration and expansion of various capabilities  features and technologies allow us to better penetrate the residential wireless telephony markets and to take advantage of the three trends in the market the move from wired to wireless products  the transformation from analog based to digital based technologies incorporated within the telephony products  and the market acceptance of and change of bandwidth for the telephony products from mhz to ghz technologies 
our focus on the convergence of these three trends has allowed us to offer products with more features  and better range  security and voice quality  as well as  the ability in the future to integrate voice and data in the same device 
in  the increase in our revenues was primarily a result of strong demand from our oem customers  especially in japan  for our ghz single and multi hand set chip sets 
our ability to offer a more integrated product  together with the growth of wireless residential markets  contributed to our significant growth 
products which we are developing in are the dect ghz chip set for the european market  and a bluetooth chip set and a ghz chip set for the us market 
during  we were able to offset the continued decline in average selling prices of our integrated circuits for the cordless telephony products by decreasing our manufacturing costs  partially due to technological improvements 
due to an increase in revenues and close monitoring of our expenses  we significantly increased our operating income as a percentage of total revenues from in to in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in however  our ability to continue the growth we experienced during the previous years depends significantly on market acceptance of our new products  as well as our ability to deliver state of the art technologies in a cost effective and timely manner 
we are also very dependent on the ability of our oem customers to penetrate the consumer markets with their end products that integrate our technologies 
further  we are dependent on our ability to continue to monitor and control costs and improve operating yields in order to offset future declines in average selling prices 
we cannot assure you that our business will grow at the previous pace  if at all 
you should not rely upon our past operating results as an indication of future performance 
critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  impairment of goodwill other than a temporary decline in the value of marketable securities  and contingencies to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
use of estimates 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these policies include revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  right of return and price protection provision  which impact revenue  the valuation of exposures associated with the contract manufacturing operations  which impacts the cost of goods sold and gross margins  the valuation of goodwill  which may result in impairment  which impacts operating expenses  and the valuation of deferred taxes 

table of contents we have other equally important accounting policies and practices which may not require us to make significant estimates or assumption 
despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize product revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b  and statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and is based on management s judgments regarding the right of return  price protection and collectibility 
the determination of right of return and price protection provisions is based on management s analysis of objective evidence from comparable historical sales to our customers 
should there be changes to management s judgments  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate our trade receivables based upon a combination of factors 
when we become aware of a customer s inability to pay  such as in the case of bankruptcy or a decline in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to an amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
for all other customers  we recognize general reserves for bad debts 
if circumstances change  including higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
issues relating to collectibility have historically been insignificant 
inventory valuation 
our policy for valuation of inventory and commitments to purchase inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date which includes a review of  among other factors  an estimate of future demand for products within specific time horizons  valuation of existing inventory  as well as product lifecycle and product development plans 
the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for the revenue forecast  which is also consistent with our short term manufacturing plan 
inventory reserves are also provided to cover risks arising from slow moving items 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we may be required to record additional inventory write down if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management 
deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets which will result in additional income tax expense  recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
other than temporary declines in the market value of marketable securities 
we record an investment impairment charge when management determines an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
to make this determination  management reviews the carrying value of our marketable securities at the end of each reporting period to determine if any investments are impaired 
other than temporary impairments are recognized in operations if the market value of the investment is below its current carrying value for an extended period  which staff accounting bulletin no 
accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities sab generally defines as six months 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying 
table of contents investments could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
acquired goodwill 
commencing january   we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
circumstances that could trigger an interval impairment test include  but are not limited to significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  or changes in the ratio of our market capitalization to net book value 
such impairment loss is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of an asset with its carrying value 
the determination of the value of goodwill requires management to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective asset 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we could be required to record impairment charges 
any material change in our valuation of assets in the future and any consequent adjustment for impairment could have a material adverse impact on our future reported financial results 
contingencies 
we are from time to time involved in legal proceedings and other claims 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters  resulting in higher net loss 
our future operating results will be dependent upon a variety of factors 
in evaluating our business  you should carefully consider the information set forth in the section captioned risk factors and other sections of this annual report on form k 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  taxes on income  financing operations  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
results of operations despite facing the challenging  volatile and uncertain global business environment and contraction in the semiconductor industry  during  we significantly increased our revenues and net income from our fabless semiconductor business excluding the discontinued operations of our dsp cores licensing business 
in  we demonstrated year over year growth of in revenues 
our gross profit and operating income increased by and  respectively  compared to 
table of contents total revenues 
our total revenues from continuing operations were million in  million in and million in this represents an increase in revenues of in as compared to revenues in  and an increase of in revenues in as compared to those in our revenues for the year increased primarily as a result of strong demand for our new ghz single hand set and ghz multi hand set products 
the increase in revenues in as compared to was primarily the result of strong demand for our mhz narrow band chip set 
as we are a fabless semiconductor company selling our products to oem customers that operate in the consumer market  our revenues are affected by seasonality sales to these customers 
the fourth quarter is usually the strongest quarter for sales by our oem customers in the consumer markets  and thus  our third quarter is usually the strongest quarter for revenues  as we supply components to our oem customers for integration into their end products 
this trend can be observed from reviewing our quarterly information and results of operations 
we also generate revenues from the licensing of our truespeech algorithms 
however  license fees and per unit royalties from truespeech licensees have not been significant to date  and we do not expect them to increase significantly in the future 
export sales consisting of integrated digital telephony idt speech processors shipped to manufacturers in europe and asia  including japan  represented of our total revenues in both and  and in the increase in export sales in and as compared to was primarily due to higher sales to the japanese market 
all export sales are denominated in us dollars 
significant customers 
revenues from one distributor  tomen electronics  accounted for of our total revenues in as compared to in and in the increase in as compared to was primarily due to a greater volume of sales in japan 
the japanese market and the oems that operate in that market are among the largest suppliers with significant market share in the us market for residential wireless products 
the loss of tomen electronics or one or more of our other major distributors or customers  or the loss by tomen electronics of one of its major customers  could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of product sales was in each of and  and in in  we managed to offset the continued decline in average selling prices of our products with a reduction in manufacturing costs  due to technological improvements and continuing improvements in our yield percentages  especially in our rf products 
maintaining our gross margins in as compared to was also attributed to the introduction of our new ghz product lines which have higher pricing and higher margins  as well as the integration of more semiconductor content in a single system 
however  we cannot guarantee that our ongoing efforts in cost reduction will be successful or that they will keep pace with the anticipated continued decline in average selling prices of our processors 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in  and were million in the decrease was primarily attributed to the decrease in expenses related to voip projects  as well as the devaluation of the new israeli shekel nis compared to the us dollar 
a significant portion of our research and development team is located and employed in our israeli development center 
as a result  we experienced a decrease in engineers payroll expenses denominated in nis of our research and development employees employed by our israeli subsidiary  partially offset by greater use of subcontractors and semiconductor mask work expenses incurred in connection with the introduction of new products 
the increase in research and development expenses in as compared to was primarily due to the hiring of additional engineers associated with our voip and rf ghz cmos design projects 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and in the decrease in percentage in as compared to resulted mainly from higher level of revenues in the increase in as compared to was primarily due to hiring additional engineers associated with our voip and rf projects 
research and development expenses consist mainly of payroll to employees involved in research and development activities  tape out and mask work  subcontracting and 
table of contents engineering  depreciation and maintenance fees relating to equipment and software tools involved with the development work and associated facilities expenses 
sales and marketing expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase in as compared to was primarily attributed to payment of higher sales commissions due to higher revenues 
the higher sales commissions were partially offset by lower payroll expenses denominated in nis for our sales and marketing employees employed by our israeli subsidiary due to a decrease in the value of nis in comparison to the united states dollar 
the slight decrease in expenses in as compared to was primarily attributed to lower sales commissions due to different commission rates applied to the change in product mix sold in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and in sales and marketing expenses consist mainly of sales commissions to our representatives and distributors  payroll expenses to direct sales and marketing employees  trade show expenses and associated facilities expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased slightly to million in from million in and million in the increase in general and administrative expenses in was mainly due to higher level of bonus payments to our employees which was partially offset by lower expenses 
these lower expenses were due to the cessation of amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of voicepump  in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which was adopted in january  general and administrative expenses increased in from mainly due to additional personnel expenses as well as amortization of goodwill related to the acquisition of voicepump 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and in general and administrative expenses consist mainly of payroll for management and administrative employees  investor relations expenses  accounting and legal costs  as well as associated facilities expenses 
unusual items 
in the first quarter of  we recorded two non recurring expense items amounting to approximately  in the aggregate 
an expense of approximately  was recorded with respect to the aborted initial public offering of our dsp cores licensing business 
these expenses were comprised mainly of legal and accounting services rendered in additionally  an expense of approximately  was recorded to reflect the write off of all of our investment in messagebay  inc  a private company that develops both turnkey and customized software 
in the first quarter of  we recorded two non recurring expense items amounting to approximately million in the aggregate 
a write off of million was recorded in respect of the acquired in process research and development recorded in connection with the acquisition of approximately of the outstanding shares of voicepump 
an expense of million was recorded in order to reflect the accelerated amortization of acquired assets and intangibles related to the acquisition of mhz rf and baseband technology from applied micro devices  inc we did not record any unusual items in interest and other income expense 
interest and other income  net  decreased to income of million in from income of in and million in the decrease in interest and other income net of interest expense in as compared to and in as compared to  was a result of overall lower market interest rates in and  partially offset by higher levels of cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and short term bank deposits in and equity in earnings of affiliate 
since april   we no longer maintained significant influence over the operating and financial policies of audiocodes  ltd 
and thus stopped accounting for this investment under the equity method of accounting 
our equity in the net income of audiocodes was  in all of which was recorded in the first quarter of and  in minority interest in losses of subsidiary 
we included in our consolidated statements of income for  an amount of  for our minority interest in voicepump s losses all of which was recorded in the first quarter of 
in  our minority interest in voicepump s losses was  
table of contents impairment of available for sale marketable securities 
during the second quarter of  our management s evaluation indicated that the decline in value of audiocodes ordinary shares was other than temporary 
therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 we realized a loss on our investment in audiocodes in the amount of million  which was recorded as impairment of available for sale marketable securities in our unaudited consolidated statements of income for the six months ended june  and included as such in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  impairment of available for sale marketable securities also included the decline in value of our investment in the equity securities of tower semiconductors ltd 
and tomen corporation  which were assessed to be other than temporary  amounting to  and  respectively both recorded in the fourth quarter of 
provision for income taxes 
our tax provision for and was million and million  respectively 
in addition  we recorded a tax benefit which decreased our tax liability related to our investment in audiocodes in the second quarter of in the amount of million due to the impairment of such investment 
thus  the provision for income taxes presented in the financial statements amounted to  in in and  we benefited for federal tax purposes from foreign tax holiday and tax exempt income in israel 
dsp group ltd  our israeli subsidiary  was granted approved enterprise status by the israeli government with respect to five separate investment plans 
approved enterprise status allows for a tax holiday for a period of two to four years and a reduced corporate tax rate of for an additional six or eight years  on each investment plan s proportionate share of taxable income 
the tax benefits under these investment plans are scheduled to expire starting through to in  in connection with the separation  dsp group ltd  our wholly owned israeli subsidiary  obtained a tax ruling from the israeli tax authorities for the tax exempt split plan pursuant to section a a of the israeli income tax ordinance section 
under section and pursuant to the ruling  the majority of the assets that remain in dsp group ltd 
after the separation cannot be sold for a two year period and is subject to other requirements as determined by law 
as part of the separation  certain benefits of the approved plans were assigned from dsp group ltd 
to parthusceva ltd  a wholly owned israeli subsidiary of parthusceva  inc  as determined by the israeli tax authorities  based on the volume of revenues of dsp group ltd 
and its dsp cores licensing division in prior years 
discontinued operations 
on april   we entered into a combination agreement with ceva  inc  our then wholly owned subsidiary and parthus technologies plc pursuant to which we agreed to affect a combination of ceva with parthus 
on november   we contributed our dsp cores licensing business and the operations and related assets and liabilities of such business to ceva and distributed all of the ceva common stock we held to our stockholders 
immediately afterwards  parthus was acquired by ceva in exchange for the issuance of additional shares of ceva common stock 
the new combined company was renamed parthusceva  inc in anticipation of the consummation of these transactions  as of june   we began to report the statements of income of our dsp cores licensing business as discontinued operations 
our financial statements for the years ended december   and are presented to reflect the operations of ceva as discontinued operations 
our financial statements for previous years included the dsp cores licensing business that was transferred to parthusceva 
the assets  liabilities  results of operations and cash flows of the dsp cores licensing business were carved out from our financial statements and are presented as discontinued operations 
the consolidated financial statements have been carved out using the historical basis of the assets and liabilities and historical results of operations related to the dsp cores licensing business 

table of contents additionally  the discontinued operations for previous years include allocations of certain of our corporate headquarters assets  liabilities and expenses relating to the dsp cores licensing business 
the net income from discontinued operations include the costs directly attributable to the dsp cores licensing business  including charges for shared facilities  functions and services used by the dsp cores licensing business 
such costs include research and development costs  sales  and general and administrative expenses 
such allocations and charges are based on either a direct cost pass through or a percentage of total costs for the services provided based on factors such as headcount or the specific level of activity directly related to such costs 
our statements of income for include the results of operations of ceva from the beginning of the year until the date of the separation november  net income derived from our dsp cores licensing business was million for the months ended october   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to and was primarily due to a decrease in total revenues for the dsp cores licensing business 
our total revenues for the dsp cores licensing business were million for the months period of  as compared to million and million for the years and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to i lower licensing revenues for the dsp cores licensing business  ii lower per unit royalties from some of the license agreements for the dsp cores licensing business primarily due to volume pricing  and iii lower technical support and other revenues primarily attributed to the provision of fewer technical support and related services for the dsp cores licensing business primarily as a result of the slowdown in the global wireless and cellular markets 
in the first ten months of  the dsp core licensing business witnessed a challenging environment in the telecommunications and semiconductors industries  resulting in longer sales cycles and delays in purchases by potential customers of products incorporating our dsp cores technologies 
our results of operations for the year ended december  include an amount of  related to the disposal of assets and liabilities  net  of our licensing business after the separation 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
during  we generated million of cash and cash equivalents from our operating activities  as compared to million during and million in the increase in cash provided by our operations during as compared to was primarily due to higher volume of revenues and increase in gross margins which resulted in a significant increase in our gross profit which was slightly offset by an increase in our operating expenses 
the combination of these factors resulted in an increase in operating income in in addition  the increase in cash from operating activities resulted from an increase in income taxes payable as well as from an increase in accrued expenses and other accounts payable 
this increase in was partially offset by an increase in inventory as well as a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits in in comparison to the significant increase in cash from operating activities from to was mainly due to the non cash effects of the capital gains attributed to the sale of audiocodes stock  an increase in deferred income tax  net  and a decrease in our trade receivables 
the significant increase in of cash and cash equivalents from operations was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of in process research and development costs related to the voicepump acquisition  as well as a decrease in trade payables  income tax payable  accrued expenses and other accounts payable 
our inventory increased to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in inventory was primarily attributed to our higher levels of sales and production during  as well as from changing our manufacturing procedures from a turn key solution to work in progress utilizing subcontractors to test  assemble and pack the integrated circuits 

table of contents investing activities 
we invest excess cash in marketable securities of varying maturity  depending on our projected cash needs for operations  capital expenditures and other business purposes 
in  we purchased million of investments classified as held to maturity marketable securities  as compared to million in and million in in addition  million of our investments in marketable securities matured in as compared to million in and million in our capital equipment purchases amounted to million in  million in and million in and were mainly for computer hardware and software used in engineering development  engineering test and lab equipment  leasehold improvements  vehicles  and furniture and fixtures 
in addition  in january  we invested million in  ordinary shares of an independent wafer manufacturer company  tower semiconductor ltd  and in june  we sold  of tower semiconductor s ordinary shares for approximately million 
the investment was recorded as available for sale marketable securities in accordance with sfas no 
and was recorded in our consolidated balance sheets under other assets 
our cash contributed to ceva  presented as discontinued operations  for was million  as compared to million for the increase in cash contributed to discontinued operations for was mainly due to an increase in prepaid accounting and legal expenses incurred in relation to consummating the transfer of our dsp cores licensing business to ceva and its subsequent combination with parthus 
financing activities 
during  we received million upon the exercise of employee stock options and through purchases pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  as compared to million during and million during as part of the separation  we transferred to ceva million in cash and paid  in cash to the israeli tax authorities  these amounts were recorded as a dividend in our statements of cash flows as part of our financing activities 
stock repurchase program 
our board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to a maximum of  shares of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
during the year  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share  for an aggregated purchase price of million 
in  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock 
in february  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  at december   our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents totaling million and held to maturity marketable securities totaling million 
our working capital at december  was million 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least the next months 
a decrease in our sales would likely affect our working capital balance 
as part of our business strategy  we occasionally evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies 
accordingly  a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses 
such potential transactions may require substantial capital resources  which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that we will consummate any such transactions 
see risk factors we may engage in future acquisitions that could dilute our stockholders equity and harm our business  results of operations and financial condition

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
interest rate risk 
it is our policy not to enter into interest rate derivative financial instruments  except for hedging of foreign currency exposures discussed below 
we do not currently have any significant interest rate exposure since we do not have any financial obligation and our financial assets are measured on a held to maturity basis 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
as a significant part of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars  we have experienced only insignificant foreign exchange gains and losses to date  and do not expect to incur significant gains and losses in however  due to the volatility in the exchange rate of the nis versus the us dollar  we decided to hedge part of the risk of a devaluation of the nis  which could have an adverse effect on the expenses that we incur in the state of israel 
for example  to protect against the increase in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from salary payments denominated in nis during the year  we instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program 
these option contracts are designated as cash flow hedges  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and are all effective as hedges of these expenses 
for more information about our hedging activity  see note to the attached notes to consolidated financial statement for the year ended december
