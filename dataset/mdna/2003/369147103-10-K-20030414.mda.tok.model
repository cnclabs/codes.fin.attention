critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require the company to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company considers the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements 
actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions  and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
the company did not initially adopt any accounting policies with a material impact during other than the required adoption of sfas no 
long lived assets including tangible and definite lived intangible assets 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long lived assets including property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset group may not be fully recoverable 
these events or changes in circumstances include business plans and forecasts  economic or competitive positions within an industry  as well as current operating performance and anticipated future performance based on a business competitive position 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in earnings 
the company continually applies its best judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairment  and the fair value of an impaired long lived asset group 
the dynamic economic environment in which our businesses operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of all impaired tests

in order to manage the volatility relating to interest rates  the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
in order to manage the volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates the company denominates substantially all purchase and sale transactions in us dollars 
the company does not anticipate any material changes in its primary market risk exposures in the near future 
the company does not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company s primary market risks are fluctuations in interest rates and variability in interest rate spread relationships ie  prime to libor spreads on its bank debt and interest rate swap see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company had million outstanding subject to an interest rate swap 
this swap is used to convert floating rate debt relating to the company s revolving credit agreement to fixed rate debt to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations

the company purchases approximately  of product monthly from its chinese joint ventures  which use proceeds thereof  to satisfy locally incurred liabilities in renminbi rmb 
had there been an adverse fluctuation between the exchange rate of the us dollar and the rmb  it would have resulted in a potential loss of earnings of approximately million at december  however  based upon minimal historical volatility between the rmb and the us dollar  the company believes the likelihood of a significant potential loss in future earnings from changes in the foreign currency exchange rate to be minimal
