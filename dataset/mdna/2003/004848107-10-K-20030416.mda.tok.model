overview and trend information the following discussion includes statements that are forward looking in nature 
whether such statements ultimately prove to be accurate  depends upon a variety of factors that may affect our business and operations 
certain of these factors are discussed at item description of business factors that may influence future results 
during  we operated in three reportable segments software consulting and development  energy intelligence solutions and computer hardware sales and we are continuing our business activity in all three segments during software consulting and development revenues increased by approximately million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from a million increase in revenues due to the acquisition of endan in december and a decrease of million in revenues due to a slowing economy in general and in the hi tech sector in particular 
the segment loss increased by approximately million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the continuing downward pressure on revenues resulted in an impairment of goodwill  acquired software and a cost investment of million  million included in cost of sales and million  respectively  for the year ended december  million net of minority interests 
excluding the above impairment charges net of minority interests  the net loss decreased by approximately million 
the improvement in stemmed primarily from the cost cutting measures taken during  which resulted in a profitable fourth quarter in should the market s negative trend continue  we may not be able to sustain significant profits in this segment  although we believe the improved cost structure will cause this segment to be at least break even in the future 
energy intelligence solutions in  new management reorganized comverge s business to address the evolving needs of the energy intelligence solutions market 
this resulted in increased revenues and improved productivity  including the first profitable quarter for the segment 
comverge s recent private equity financing and new credit facility should give comverge the capital it needs to finance and expand its business 
computer hardware the improved results in this segment are due to the record sales in the fourth quarter of although we do not expect sales in the coming quarters to be at a similar level  we expect sales for the year to exceed the level 
sales in were also characterized by a greater dependence on a few large customers  with coming from the three largest customers in  as compared to in critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following discussion of critical accounting policies represents our attempt to bring to the attention of readers of this report those accounting policies which we believe are critical to our consolidated financial statements and other financial disclosure 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies  which are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition  foreign currency transactions  inventory  income taxes  and goodwill and other long lived assets 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are significant as our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
revenue from time and materials service contracts  maintenance agreements and other services are recognized as services are provided 
revenue on the sale of products and software are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  delivery has occurred and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
such revenues generally do not involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
we derived million of revenues from fixed price contracts million from our software and consulting development segment and million from our energy intelligence segment  representing approximately of consolidated sales in million and and million and in and  respectively  which require the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized using the percentage of completion method as costs primarily direct labor are incurred  with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then future revenue and consulting margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting changes in revenues and reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations 
foreign currency transactions we have several foreign subsidiaries which together account for approximately of our net revenues for the year ended december   and of our assets and of our total liabilities as of december  under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of foreign currency transactions is dependent upon our management s determination regarding the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
if any subsidiary s functional currency would be deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements would be included in cumulative translation adjustments on our consolidated balance sheets and as part of comprehensive income on our consolidated statements of operations 
if a subsidiary is disposed  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized into our consolidated statement of operations 
however  because the functional currency of our subsidiaries is deemed to be the us dollar  then any gain or loss associated with transactions in the local currency is included within our consolidated statement of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories to establish a new cost basis 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
we evaluate the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
income taxes we have a history of unprofitable operations from losses incurred in a number of our operations 
these losses generated sizeable state  federal and foreign tax net operating loss nol carryforwards  of approximately  and million as of december   respectively 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset associated with these nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize them to offset future income taxes 
due to our history of unprofitable operations  we only recognize net deferred tax assets in those subsidiaries that we believe are more likely than not able to utilize them to offset future income taxes in the future 
we currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes on current income 
it is possible  however  that we could be profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
upon reaching such a conclusion  we would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax assets at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates or foreign rates 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax assets could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
goodwill and other long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets held for use whenever circumstances indicate there may be an impairment 
for all assets excluding goodwill  the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset 
if this occurs  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
effective july  and january  we adopted sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under these new accounting standards  we no longer amortize our goodwill and are required to complete an annual impairment test 
for the purpose of implementing sfas no 
we have designated the fourth quarter as the period of the annual test and determined that we have three reporting units  which are the same as our three reportable segments 
in the third quarter of this  we came to the conclusion that due to the slow down in the hi tech markets  we would probably record an impairment in the fourth quarter 
as such  in the third quarter of we recognized expenses for the impairment of goodwill and acquired software of million million net of minority interests 
in the fourth quarter of  no additional adjustment was recorded  when performing the annual evaluation 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million of goodwill  million of which relates to our software consulting and development segment and million of which relates to our energy intelligence solutions segment 
additionally  at december   we had million net book value of other identifiable intangible assets

see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for reconciliation to our consolidated financial information 
compared to sales 
sales in were million  increasing by million  or  from million in  due to sales increases in all segments 
energy intelligence solution sales increased by million  or  from million in  to million in the increase in this segment s sales was primarily attributable to fulfillment of a large contract to sell our maingate c i and powercamp systems to a major utility and to a generally higher level of business 
sales in the computer hardware segment continued to improve  increasing by million  or  from million in  to million in although sales in this segment were improving through the year  the increase was primarily attributable to the million in sales in the fourth quarter of the increase in the fourth quarter of was primarily attributable to sales of million to a single customer 
software consulting and development sales increased by million  or  from million in  to million in this improvement in sales was entirely attributable to the expanded revenue base achieved as a result of the endan acquisition by dsit in december  which more than offset the general weakness in the global hi tech markets and in the software consulting and development market in particular 
gross profit 
gross profit in was million increasing by million  or  compared to  with gross profit margins improving  from in  to in the increase in gross profits was attributable to improvements in all segments  particularly in the energy intelligence solutions segment 
gross profit in the energy intelligence solution segment increased by million  or  from million  or of sales  in to million  or of sales  in the increase in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to a million settlement with its former contract manufacturer and approximately million to increases in sales of products of higher margin products 
in the computer hardware segment gross profit increased by million  or  primarily due to the increase in sales 
gross profit in the software consulting and development segment also increased by million  or  from million  or of sales  in  to million  or of sales  in the increase in gross profits was primarily attributable to the increase in sales  as well as improved cost structure 
research and development expenses r d 
r d expenses decreased from million in  to million in this decrease was due to a decrease in r d expenditures in the energy intelligence solution segment  as it shifted its emphasis from r d in to marketing and sales in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
despite the significant increase in sales  sg a remained relatively stable increasing by million  from million in  to million in impairment of goodwill and investment 
the entire expense recorded was due to our software consulting and development segment 
with the acquisition of endan by our dsit subsidiary in december  we recognized goodwill and acquired software valued at a total of million 
this value was supported by third party valuations prepared at the time of the acquisition  based on sales and business projections made at that time 
since then  the hi tech market in general and that of software consulting in particular have continued to deteriorate 
as a result  in the third quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
we have made concerted efforts to offset this negative trend with cost cutting measures already implemented 
as we look forward to the  the impairment charge recorded reflects our reassessment of the values then recorded with respect to the entire software consulting and development segment to reflect our current sales projections  based on the same valuation models employed at the time of the endan acquisition 
we are confident that the expected revenue levels and the cost cutting measures already implemented will provide for breakeven and even positive performance in the coming periods  justifying the remaining goodwill and value attached to this segment 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a write down of  with respect to an investment in a start up company 
interest income expense 
to finance our operations we utilized our investments and capital raised through issuing convertible debentures and obtaining lines of credit 
the utilization of our investments caused the decrease in interest income and we expect interest income to further decrease in coming periods 
we incurred finance expenses in connection with the capital raised including interest and amortization of costs associated with the convertible debt and warrants issued 
although the interest associated with the utilization of lines of credit is expected to continue at the current level  the amortization expenses are expected to decrease over the coming quarters 
of the million of interest expense during the year ended december   million was related to the accretion of discounts and the amortization of related costs in connection with convertible debt and warrants 
minority interests 
minority interests reflects primarily the minority interests in losses generated by our dsit subsidiary  primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and acquired software in this segment as described above 
compared to sales 
sales decreased by to million in from million in  due to a decrease in sales in all segments 
sales in the software consulting and development segment decreased by million  or  as a result of the continued downturn in the hi tech economy generally and in the demand for software consulting and development services in particular  as well as a decrease in computer embedded software sales 
sales also decreased in the energy intelligence solutions segment by million  or 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the inclusion in of non recurring sales of component inventory and order backlog purchased as part of the scientific atlanta control systems division million  and sales of a specialized load control product developed for a single customer million 
in our computer hardware segment  sales decreased by million  or  resulting from the slowdown in the economy  especially since september th  and particularly in the greater new york city metropolitan area  which is the primary market for the segment 
our sales in the computer hardware segment decreased by in the second half of to million  from million in the second half of gross profit 
gross profit decreased by to million  or of sales  in  from million  or of sales  in this decrease was due to a million  or  decrease in gross profit of our software consulting and development segment and a million  or  decrease in gross profit of our energy intelligence solutions segment  partially offset by a million  or  increase in gross profit in our computer hardware sales segment 
the decrease in the software consulting and development segment was due to the decrease in sales  particularly the inclusion in of certain highly profitable computer embedded software sales which contributed to the deterioration in gross profit margins from in to in in our energy intelligence solutions segment  the decrease in gross profit was due to a combination of the decrease in sales and a decrease in gross profit margins from in to in in our computer hardware sales segment  the increase in gross profit was entirely due to the improvement in gross margin from of sales in to in as result of a change in our customer mix 
r d 
r d expenses more than doubled to million in as compared to million in this increase was due to a concentrated effort in the energy intelligence solutions segment to complete the development of and make available to customers a broader set of solutions  while refocusing our existing products 
among the technologies developed are mhz communication capabilities to enhance our dcu load control product  latest generation cdpd technology upgrade for our cdc product and upgrade and enhancement of the control system software for our maingate system currently being installed at gulf power 
sg a 
sg a increased by to million in  from million in the increase was attributable to a million  or increase in our energy intelligence solutions segment 
the increase in sg a in comverge was attributable to the increased level of marketing and administrative costs  including costs associated with hiring a new ceo  cfo  executive vice president and other senior staff for comverge 
salaries and related costs in comverge increased by million in as compared to  due in large part to these hirings 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in corporate expenses primarily due to a non recurring bonus of million paid to the ceo in the first quarter of interest income 
interest income decreased to million in  from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in the amounts invested  as they were being utilized to finance our operations  as well as the decrease in interest rates over the year 
income taxes 
we recorded a small tax benefit in as compared to a tax expense of million in we establish valuation allowances against virtually all deferred tax assets  as we believe that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
for a detailed analysis of the income tax provision  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had working capital of  including million in non restricted cash and cash equivalents 
net cash used in operating activities in the fourth quarter of was million in addition to the million net cash used in the first three quarters of this year 
the primary uses of our net cash in were our loss  including the losses in comverge and all corporate expenses  and million investment in inventory over 
these expenditures were financed by the proceeds from sale and maturity of marketable and debt securities and the proceeds from issuance of a convertible note 
in december comverge acquired a million line of credit  secured by its inventory  accounts receivables  databit s accounts receivables and a corporate guarantee 
as of december  comverge had utilized million of this line of credit 
as described above under the caption recent developments on april  comverge completed of its previously announced private equity financing in the amount of million  million of which was invested by us and million of which was invested by a group of leading energy venture capital investors 
at the same time  comverge obtained a new credit arrangement of million 
in connection with this new credit facility  comverge paid off in full its million as at march  loan with bank leumi usa and the outstanding balance its million line of credit with laurus  which line was also terminated 
the new credit facility includes a million term loan secured by our pledge of million  which is being held in as a restricted long term deposit at comverge s new lender  and a million revolving line of credit secured by the assets of comverge 
as part of the new credit arrangements  million of the long term deposit held at bank leumi as security for comverge s loan became unrestricted and is now freely available to us as working capital 
comverge has agreed to prepay the term loan and permit release of our long term deposit over the next months  subject to certain conditions 
we believe that the proceeds of the financing and new credit arrangements should provide sufficient financing for comverge to independently fund its activities 
due to the significant interest in comverge held by others and other restrictions  working capital and cash flows of comverge will not be available to finance other us activities 
of the total working capital at december   million was in our majority owned dsit subsidiary 
due to israeli tax and company law constraints as well as the significant minority interest in dsit  such working capital and cash flows from dsit s operations  which amounted to million for the year ended december   are not available to finance us activities 
dsit is utilizing million of its million lines of credit 
dsit s lines of credit are denominated in nis and bearing an average interest rate of the israeli prime rate plus per annum 
the israeli prime rate fluctuates and as of december  was 
we believe that dsit will have sufficient liquidity to finance its activities from cash flow from its own operations over the next months 
this is based on continued utilization of its line of credit and improved operating results stemming from continued cost reductions 
we believe that we have more than sufficient liquidity to finance our us based operating activities excluding comverge and our corporate activities for at least the months following the date of this report 
we expect comverge to fund its activities from the proceeds of its recent fund raising and its credit lines 
we intend to finance our other us activities from cash on hand as of april  of million  including million released as part of comverge s bank arrangements and million from the sale of shares of our common stock to laurus on april   and from operating cash flow from expected profitable operations of the computer hardware segment 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations and commitments at december   excluding certain severance arrangements described below  principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness  future minimum operating lease obligations and contractual obligations to our ceo for payments for his post retirement consulting services to us are as set forth in the table below 
cash payments due during year ending december  in thousands contractual obligations total after long term debt related to us operations    long term debt related to israeli operations guarantees operating leases      consulting agreement with ceo  total contractual cash obligations      we expect to finance these contractual commitments from cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
we also have obligations under various agreements and other arrangements with officers and other employees with respect to severance arrangements and multiyear employment agreements 
previously  the company accrued a loss for contingent performance of bank guarantees 
the company s remaining commitment under these guarantees is  at december the company has collateralized a portion of these guarantees by means of a deposit  as of december  the obligation is presented as being due in  though we are uncertain as to when actual payment may be made 
under israeli law and labor agreements  dsit and comverge s subsidiary in israel are required to make severance payments to dismissed employees and to employees leaving employment in certain other circumstances 
the obligation for severance pay benefits  as determined by the israeli severance pay law  is based upon length of service and last salary 
these obligations are substantially covered by regular deposits with recognized severance pay and pension funds and by the purchase of insurance policies 
as of december   we had a total of million in potential severance obligations  of which approximately million was funded with cash to insurance companies and approximately million was unfunded 
the entire million was accrued for as of december  under the terms of his employment agreement with us  we have an obligation to pay our chief executive officer consulting fees over a seven year period upon his retirement on december  although we contemplate that those payments will begin on january   our ceo has the option to terminate his employment agreement and begin his consulting period on or prior to december  during the first four years of the consulting period  we would have to pay our ceo of his salary in effect at the time of termination and of that salary during the last three years of the consulting period  plus contributions to a non qualified defined contribution retirement plan equal to of the consulting fee 
at the start of the consulting period  we are also required to fund amounts payable for the term of the consulting period  by the purchase of an annuity or similar investment product 
the ceo s salary for is  we also have severance arrangements under an employment agreement with our chief financial officer to pay severance under certain circumstances 
if our cfo employment agreement is terminated by us or by him for reasons other than for cause  we must pay him i an amount equal to of his last month s salary multiplied by the number of years including partial years that the cfo worked for us  plus ii an amount equal to five times his last month s salary or two times such salary if the cfo terminates the employment agreement other than after a change in control or a breach by us of his employment agreement 
our severance obligation would be reduced by the amount contributed by us to certain israeli pension and severance funds pursuant to the cfo s employment agreement 
as of december   the unfunded portion of such severance obligation was our energy intelligence solutions subsidiary may in certain circumstances be liable to make severance payments to its ceo and its executive vice president 
under the employment agreement with the ceo of the subsidiary if his employment is terminated without cause  the subsidiary would have to pay the subsidiary ceo one year of base salary  or if there has been an ipo for the subsidiary  three years of base salary plus up to of any excess parachute payment 
the subsidiary ceo s salary for is  per annum 
under our employment agreement with the executive vice president of our energy intelligence solutions segment  if such officer s employment agreement were terminated without cause  the subsidiary would have to pay to such officer three months of base salary  during for each year or partial year of service to the subsidiary up to a maximum of one year of salary 
the executive vice president s employment commenced in march our energy intelligence solutions subsidiary is not obligated to make any severance payments under these agreements if the ceo or the executive vice president voluntary terminates his employment agreement 
we also have severance arrangements under an employment agreement with the chief executive officer of dsit to pay severance under certain circumstances 
if his employment agreement is terminated by us or by him for reasons other than for cause  we must pay him i an amount equal to last month s salary multiplied by the number of years including partial years that he worked for endan and dsit 
our severance obligation would be reduced by the amount contributed by us to certain israeli pension and severance funds pursuant to his employment agreement 
as of december   the unfunded portion of such severance obligation was  impact of inflation and currency fluctuations a majority of our sales are denominated in dollars 
the remaining portion is primarily denominated in nis  linked to the dollar 
such sales transactions are negotiated in dollars  however  for the convenience of the customer they are settled in nis 
these transaction amounts are linked to the dollar between the date the transactions are entered into until the date they are effected and billed 
from the time these transactions are effected and billed  through the date of settlement  amounts are primarily unlinked 
the majority of our expenses in israel are in nis  while a portion is in dollars or dollar linked nis 
the dollar cost of our operations in israel may be adversely affected in the future by a revaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar  should it be significantly different from the rate of inflation 
in the devaluation of the nis against the dollar was  whereas in the devaluation of the nis against the dollar was 
inflation in israel was and during these same periods  respectively 
during the first two months of  the nis was further devalued against the dollar by and inflation during this period was as of december   virtually all of our monetary assets and liabilities that were not denominated in dollars or dollar linked nis were denominated in nis  and the net amount of such monetary assets and liabilities was not material 
in the event that in the future we have material net monetary assets or liabilities that are not denominated in dollar linked nis  such net assets or liabilities would be subject to the risk of currency fluctuations 
payments to related parties we paid an individual as a director and vice president  who is the son of our chief executive officer  approximately   and  for the years ending december   and  respectively 
we also have engaged certain of our directors and former directors to render professional services to us

we do not employ specific strategies  such as the use of derivative instruments or hedging  to manage our interest rate or exchange rate exposures 
fair value of financial instruments fair values of financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are estimated to approximate their book values due to the short maturity of such investments 
fair value for long term debt and long term deposits are estimated based on the current rates offered to us for debt and deposits with similar terms and remaining maturities 
the fair value of our long term debt and long term deposits are not materially different from their carrying amounts 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  short and long term bank deposits  and trade receivables 
the counterparty to a majority of our cash equivalent deposits as well as our short and long term bank deposits is a major financial institution of high credit standing 
we do not believe there is significant risk of non performance by these counterparties 
approximately of the trade accounts receivable at december  was due from a us customer that pays its trade receivables over usual credit periods 
credit risk with respect to the balance of trade receivables is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the our customer base
