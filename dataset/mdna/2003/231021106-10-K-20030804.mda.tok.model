item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
restatement of previously issued financial statements the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations set forth in this item has been revised to reflect the restatement of the company s consolidated financial statements for the years and and certain events occurring subsequent to the original due date for filing this annual report on form k 
in addition  we have updated our disclosure with respect to recently issued accounting standards 
on april   we announced that we had determined that our previously issued financial statements for the years ended december  and would require restatement and reaudit 
the restatement was necessary to correct prior period accounting errors related primarily to unreconciled accounts payable accounts at two of our manufacturing locations  the majority of which were associated with the integration of a new enterprise resource planning system into our accounting processes 
we were required to have these restated financial statements audited by our current auditors  since arthur andersen llp  our predecessor auditor for the years subject to restatement  had ceased operations 
the restatement and reaudit of our financial statements included a comprehensive review of the accounting records underlying our financial statements for the related periods 
the accompanying financial statements reflect adjustments made to our previously reported information as a result of this comprehensive review and the work performed during the restatement and reaudit process in order to correct accounting errors primarily associated with the period of accounting recognition 
we have segregated these adjustments into the following categories adjustments stemming from the unreconciled accounts at our manufacturing locations referred to above 
these errors resulted from deficiencies in our control processes to identify and resolve the reconciliation issues in a timely manner 
adjustments related to the correction of accounting errors previously recorded in the period management identified the error 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap and sab permit these types of adjustments to be recorded in the period errors are identified to the extent they are not deemed material for purposes of restating prior period financial statements 
the most significant items in this category are related to the reconciliation of certain intercompany accounts and other clearing or suspense accounts associated with receivables  accounts payable and accrued payroll 
as a result of the restatement  management has now reflected these items in the periods to which they relate 
other adjustments to correct errors were identified during the restatement process and have been categorized and summarized as follows a 
revisions to various accounts primarily reserve and accrual accounts that relate to significant estimates  uncertainties and judgments where the original amount was either calculated incorrectly or documentation directly supporting the original amount could not be located 
the most significant items in this category include adjustments to obligations associated with marketing programs  inventory overhead cost capitalization and product liability reserves 
b 
adjustments to certain accounts to achieve proper and consistent application of gaap throughout our organization 
for example  this category includes adjustments for liabilities or reserves not recorded by certain of our locations that are required by us gaap 
the most significant item in this category relates to the omission of an accrual for long term variable incentive compensation in this category also includes adjustments related to the calculation of expense for certain non us subsidiary defined benefit pension plans in accordance with us gaap 
c 
corrections to previously reported restructuring charges 
these adjustments primarily relate to the timing of when certain charges were accrued or when excess reserves were reversed into earnings as a result of changes in estimates for restructuring actions 
approximately half of the adjustments to our charges related to timing of recognition of certain employee related costs in one restructuring action 
us gaap requires that these costs be accrued only after a specific announcement to employees 
at one plant location  we accrued certain costs after management made the decision to terminate employees but prior to an announcement meeting the specificity required by us gaap 
with regard to the excess reserve adjustments  we previously reversed excess restructuring reserves at the time the associated restructuring plan was substantially complete 
the adjustment was made to reverse the reserve in the period in which it was determined to be in excess  as required under us gaap

change in statement of financial position in millions as reported as restated current assets   non current assets   current liabilities  non current liabilities   shareholders investment  as a result of the restatement and reaudit  we delayed the filing of this annual report on form k for the year ended december   and our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march   with the securities and exchange commission sec 
as previously disclosed  the delay in filing resulted in a breach of a requirement for timely satisfaction of sec filing obligations under several of our credit agreements  the most significant of which are discussed below 
a majority of our long term debt is governed by three indenture agreements summarized as follows a november  indenture between the company and bny midwest trust company as trustee for million in senior notes  a june  indenture between the company and bny midwest trust company as trustee for million in convertible preferred securities  and  a march  indenture between the company and jpmorgan chase bank formerly the chase manhattan bank for four series of securities with an aggregate value of million 
under each of the indentures  we are required to deliver to the respective trustees a copy of our annual report on form k within specified periods of time after such filings are due march  
the breach caused by the delay in filing our annual report on form k gave certain rights to the trustees and debt holders under the indentures to accelerate maturity of our indebtedness if they give us notice and we do not cure the breach within days 
however  neither the trustees nor the respective debt holders have given us such notice 
as a result  we continue to classify our debt as long term in the consolidated statements of financial position 
in connection with the indenture  we agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement with the sec and complete that offer no later than may  as a result of the delay in filing our annual report on form k with the sec  we were unable to complete the exchange offer and became contractually obligated to pay an additional per annum interest on the notes issued under that indenture 
for each day delay in the completion of the exchange offer  the interest rate on the notes will increase by an additional per annum up to a maximum increase until such time as the exchange offer is completed 
in connection with the indenture governing the issue of our convertible preferred securities  we exercised our right to suspend the use of the resale prospectus  which is part of a shelf registration statement that we had filed and had declared effective to permit the resale of these securities  pending the filing of our annual report on form k with the sec 
effective march   this suspension resulted in an increase of per annum in the dividend rate borne by these securities  which we will continue to pay until we permit the resale prospectus to be used after the filing of our annual report on form k 
in november  we entered into a new credit facility agreement that provides for aggregate borrowings of up to million and is available on a revolving basis for a period of three years 
the agreement requires that we annually deliver audited financial statements to the lenders within a specified period of time 
as a result of the restatement and reaudit process  we received a waiver from our lenders through november  of any breach due to a delay in the delivery of our audited financial statements 
there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at december  by filing this annual report on form k and our quarterly report on form q for the first quarter ended march   with the sec and by delivering a copy of these filings to the trustees of the indentures and to our lender under the credit facility agreement  we will cure the noncompliance under the abovementioned indentures and comply with the terms of the credit facility agreement 
we expect to satisfy our registration obligations relating to the and indentures in the near term  following which the incremental interest and dividend payments will be discontinued

net sales the table below sets forth net sales for each of our key business segments during the last three years millions engine    power generation    filtration and other international distributor elimination of intersegment sales sales increased in all of our business segments during compared to with the exception of our power generation business 
sales of our engine business increased million  or percent  primarily reflecting strong demand in the heavy duty truck sector in advance of the october  epa emissions deadline and higher sales for the dodge ram truck 
power generation sales were  million  down million  or percent compared to the prior year  as a result of lower demand from slow economic activity 
sales in the filtration and other business were million  up million or percent year over year  reflecting demand improvement and increased market penetration 
in our international distributor business  sales increased million  or percent  compared to  primarily due to increased business at our distributors in australia and asia 
net sales for were billion  million lower than the decrease was primarily due to lower engine sales  down million  or percent as a result of reduced shipments to north american oems which were affected by the sharp downturn in the north american automotive industry and construction markets 
gross margin our gross margin was billion in  billion in and billion in with related gross margin percent of net sales of percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
compared to the prior year  gross margin in was relatively flat on a net sales increase of million  reflecting changes in sales mix as we transitioned from mature engines to new engines where margins are typically lower at introduction 
in addition  our margins were also affected by lower fixed cost absorption in our power generation business due to a significant sales decline as a result of weak power generation demand 
product coverage costs were flat year over year at percent in and the most significant factors affecting the decline in gross margin and gross margin percentage from to was lower absorption of fixed manufacturing costs in our engine business as a result of declining sales volume 
in addition  gross margin was also impacted by changes in sales mix partially offset by our cost reduction efforts and lower product coverage costs  percent in compared to percent in selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million  or percent  compared to spending levels a year ago 
the increase in selling and administrative expenses year over year is primarily a result of volume variable expenditures  funding of focused growth initiatives and higher variable compensation expense due to improved earnings  partially offset by cost reduction actions 
selling and administrative expenses in were million  down million or percent compared to expenses 
a majority of the decrease resulted from our cost reduction efforts  including benefits of restructuring actions and lower spending across all of our business segments 
research and engineering expenses research and engineering expenses in were million  a decrease of million or percent  compared to expenses 
overall  research and engineering expenses were lower due to cancellation of a major engine development program in the second quarter of and other cost reduction actions  partially offset by higher engineering costs related to the development of our emissions products 
research and engineering expenses in were million  down million  or percent  compared to the decline is primarily a result of on going cost reduction efforts and the discontinuance of a new engine development program 
income from joint ventures and alliances our income from joint ventures and alliances was million in  compared to million of income in the increase is primarily attributable to improved earnings across most of our joint ventures  particularly our joint ventures with china national heavy duty truck corporation in chongqing  which manufactures heavy duty and high horsepower diesel engines and dongfeng motors  which manufactures our b and c series midrange engines 
earnings at our partially owned distributor locations in north america and our new marine joint venture  cummins mercruiser  also contributed to the increase in earnings from joint ventures and alliances were million in compared to million in the increase in income is attributable to improved earnings from our joint ventures in china offset by lower earnings from our joint venture with komatsu

in comparison  earnings before interest and taxes in and  excluding the effects of restructuring actions  were million  or percent of sales  and million  or percent of sales  respectively 
a majority of the increase in earnings before interest and taxes in compared to is attributable to higher sales volume and improved overhead absorption at our manufacturing plants  earnings improvement in our filtration and other business  improved earnings at our joint ventures and alliances and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization  offset by lower earnings in our power generation business 
the most significant factor effecting the decrease in earnings before interest and taxes in compared to were lower gross margins in our engine business resulting from underabsorption of manufacturing costs due to declining sales volume and changes in sales mix partially offset by cost reduction efforts and lower product coverage costs 
in addition  earnings in our filtration and other business were lower reflecting reduced sales for oem truck and construction products 
business segment results engine business the revenues and operating income for the engine business segment for the three years ended december  were as follows millions net sales    earnings loss before interest  income taxes and restructuring and other charges credits restructuring and other charges credits earnings loss before interest and income taxes total net sales for our engine business were billion in compared to billion in  an increase of million  or percent  primarily due to strong sales of our dodge ram truck engine and an upturn in heavy duty oem engine shipments prior to the october new emissions standards 
net sales in were down million  or percent  when compared to net sales in  due primarily to the downturn experienced in the north american trucking industry characterized by high inventory levels of new and used trucks 
a summary of net sales for the engine business by market follows millions heavy duty truck   medium duty truck and bus light duty automotive industrial high horsepower industrial the engine business shipped  units in  an increase of  units  or percent  compared to  units shipped in engine unit shipments were down  units in  or percent lower than unit shipments in a summary unit shipments for the engine business by engine category follows unit shipments mid range    heavy duty    high horsepower    heavy duty truck sales to the heavy duty truck market were billion in  up million  or percent  compared to sales in the increase primarily reflects an upturn in north american oem engine shipments in response to accelerated purchases prior to the october  effective date of the new epa emissions standards

sales to the heavy duty international truck market were relatively flat compared to shipments of our heavy duty isx truck engine more than doubled compared to the prior year 
sales of heavy duty truck engines in were percent lower than reflecting the downturn in the north american trucking industry 
medium duty truck and bus medium duty truck and bus revenues increased million  or percent  above sales levels a year ago reflecting a slight increase in demand as a result of the october  emissions standards 
unit shipments to the north american medium duty truck market were down percent compared to a year ago 
medium duty shipments to international markets increased percent  primarily in asia 
bus engine sales declined percent globally while total unit shipments were down percent  primarily to international customers as shipments to north american oems declined percent compared to sales to the medium duty truck and bus market in were million lower  or percent below sales  primarily reflecting lower demand due to deteriorating market conditions in the north american truck industry 
light duty automotive revenues from our light duty automotive market increased million  or percent  compared to revenues 
total unit shipments were up percent compared to the prior year  with the increase evenly distributed between shipments to daimlerchrysler and shipments to oems in the north american rv market 
shipments of our isb engine to daimlerchrysler for the dodge ram truck were  units in  an increase of  units  or percent higher than a year ago  primarily driven by the introduction of the new dodge ram truck model 
unit shipments to the recreational vehicle market were up percent year over year from previously weak demand levels  reflecting some recovery in consumer markets and growth in the diesel powered segment of this market 
sales to the light duty automotive market in decreased million  or percent  compared to sales 
shipments to daimlerchrysler were off percent and were impacted by production constraints preceding the model year changeover 
engine sales to the recreational vehicle market were down percent compared to reflecting lower demand 
industrial total industrial sales to the construction  marine and agricultural markets were down million  or relatively flat compared to sales to the construction segment of this market were down slightly year over year with unit shipments to north america and international oem s down percent and percent  respectively 
engine sales to the agricultural equipment market were up percent compared to  primarily due to international oem s in latin america 
sales to the north american market increased percent 
in the marine market  sales were down percent compared to the prior year  partially as a result of our new joint venture with brunswick corporation  cummins mercruiser 
sales of engines for recreational marine applications are now recorded by the joint venture 
industrial engine sales in were down percent compared to  with a majority of the decline in the construction market where sales were down percent as oem s adjusted to lower market conditions 
high horsepower industrial sales of our v  k and q series high horsepower industrial engines in were down million or percent compared to the prior year 
unit shipments to the north american mining market declined percent while shipments to international oems in the mining markets declined percent compared to shipments of high horsepower engines to the rail sector  which is primarily international business  were down percent from the prior year 
shipments of our high horsepower engines to government markets  primarily v series military applications  were up percent with the majority of the increase in north america 
high horsepower industrial engine sales in were up percent compared to  primarily driven by market share gains in the mining segment and increased sales to the rail car market as a result of large orders in europe and asia 
earnings from operations earnings before interest  taxes and restructuring actions increased from a loss of million in to earnings of million in  an improvement of million 
the improvement is primarily a result of higher engine volumes and the accompanying benefit of fixed cost absorption at our manufacturing plants and our continued focus on cost reduction 
the million loss before interest  taxes and restructuring actions in was million worse on a comparable basis than results  primarily from lower volumes due to the downturn in the north american truck industry 
over the last two years  the engine business has lowered its break even results through restructuring actions and cost reduction efforts to better align its production costs with expected industry demand levels 
consolidation of heavy duty assembly as part of our continuing effort to reduce our production costs  we announced plans in the fourth quarter of to consolidate our heavy duty engine assembly and test operations at our jamestown  new york plant 
approximately employees in the heavy duty engine business were eliminated as a result of consolidating assembly and test operations at our columbus  indiana engine plant into existing assembly operations at our jamestown plant 
the consolidation was completed during the first quarter of none of the costs associated with the consolidation were recorded as restructuring charges 
power generation business the revenue and operating income for the power generation business segment for the three years ended december  were as follows millions net sales    earnings loss before interest  income taxes and restructuring and other charges credits restructuring and other charges earnings loss before interest and income taxes sales in our power generation business were billion  down million or percent  compared to a majority of the sales decline is a result of lower generator set sales  down percent and lower generator drive sales  down percent  offset by increased sales to the mobile and recreational vehicle markets  up percent compared to total engine shipments for the power generation market were  units  down  units  or percent lower than a year ago  reflecting weak demand and slow economic growth in this market 
power generation revenues in were percent higher than  primarily driven by higher sales to latin america and brazil and offset by lower sales in north america 
sales of small generator sets to the recreational vehicle industry were down percent in compared to a summary of engine unit shipments for the power generation business by engine category follows unit shipments midrange    heavy duty    high horsepower    total unit sales of midrange engines to the power generation market were up units  or percent compared to generator drive units powered by midrange engines increased percent over the same period while unit sales to the midrange generator set market were off percent 
total unit sales of heavy duty engines to the power generation market decreased  units  or percent  compared to heavy duty generator drive units were off percent from a year ago while generator sets powered by heavy duty engines were down percent year over year 
high horsepower unit sales in the power generation business decreased  units  or percent compared to high horsepower generator drive units declined percent year over year while high horsepower generator set units decreased percent from the prior period 
the decline in unit shipments is attributable to weakening demand in the heavy duty and high horsepower power generation equipment markets 
most of the decline in generator drive units for stationary power occurred in north america  latin america and europe and was offset by slight increases in shipments to india and southeast asia markets 
a majority of the decline in generator set units is attributable to weak demand in north america  latin america and europe 
sales of alternators increased percent in compared to while sales of small generator sets for recreational vehicles and other consumer applications increased percent in reflecting strong demand in this segment 
earnings from operations in  power generation incurred an operating loss before interest and taxes of million  compared to earnings before interest and taxes of million in the overall decline in margin and earnings before interest and taxes in the power generation business is attributable to several factors 
first is the decrease in volume due to weak demand 
second is a shift in sales mix  with a decline in unit shipments of higher margin heavy duty and high horsepower products 
third  the overall decline in sales volume resulted in underabsorption of fixed overhead costs at our manufacturing facilities 
fourth  excess inventory in the marketplace continues to create pricing pressures resulting in heavier discounting to retain market share

cash flows from operating activities was reduced by a net million from changes in accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and other operating assets and liabilities 
accounts receivable increased million  partially due to repayment of our securitization program but the increase was offset by inventory reduction and an increase in accounts payable 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million a year ago  an increase of million but down considerably from the million cash used in investing activities in cash flows from investing activities in benefited from million in proceeds from sale leaseback transactions 
excluding the cash flows from these transactions  net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in  or a decrease of million year over year 
most of the decline was a result of lower capital spending in  down million compared to reduced capital spending remains a priority in as we estimate our capital expenditures will be million  up million compared to  but down considerably from the million spending levels of and capital expenditures during the first half of included significant disbursements for a subsequently cancelled engine program 
investments in and advances to our joint ventures and alliances represented a cash outflow of million in compared to million a year ago

net proceeds of million from this issuance were used to repay borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization program and were also used to retire our notes that matured in march significant financing activities in included million in proceeds from the issuance of our preferred securities in the second quarter of of which million was used to repay borrowings under our short term credit agreements during that quarter

a majority of the increase in cash and cash equivalents occurred in the fourth quarter when we received proceeds of million from the issuance of our senior notes 
management assessment of liquidity since fiscal  we have made a strategic effort to improve our cost structure and improve efficiencies from continuing operations through monetization of assets and restructuring actions 
as a result  we have undertaken various initiatives to improve cash flow  reduce debt obligations and improve our financial flexibility 
our operations have historically generated sufficient cash to fund our businesses  capital expenditures  research and development and dividend payments 
cash provided by continuing operations is a major source of our working capital funding 
at certain times  cash provided by operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations  and as a result  periodic borrowings are used to fund working capital requirements 
we have available various short and long term credit arrangements which are discussed below and disclosed in note borrowing arrangements of our consolidated financial statements 
these credit arrangements and our accounts receivable securitization program provide the financial flexibility required to satisfy future short term funding requirements for our debt service obligations  projected working capital requirements and capital spending 
with the exception of payments required under our operating lease agreements  there are no major fixed cash payment obligations occurring until march when our notes with principal amount of million mature 
based on projected cash flows from operations and existing credit facilities  management believes the company has sufficient liquidity available to meet anticipated capital  debt and dividend requirements in the foreseeable future 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a receivable securitization program  which provides a cost effective method to fund our trade accounts receivable 
this program diversifies our funding base by providing a flexible source of funding that is not reported on our balance sheet 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under this program 
a more complete description of the securitization program  which discloses certain cash flows related to the program  is found in the following section off balance sheet financing accounts receivable securitization program 
in the second quarter of  we issued million shares of cumulative convertible preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption through cummins capital trust i  a wholly owned subsidiary 
the net proceeds of million from this issuance were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit agreement 
dividends on the preferred securities are payable at an annual rate of of the liquidation preference on march  june  september and december of each year or approximately million in each quarter 
a complete description of the preferred securities is disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
see also recently issued accounting pronouncements below regarding a new accounting standard applicable to these securities 
during the second and third quarters of  we entered into two sale leaseback transactions whereby we sold certain manufacturing equipment and aircraft and received million in proceeds from the transactions 
the leases were accounted for as operating leases 
we used the proceeds from these transactions to reduce our indebtedness and to fund our working capital requirements 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains a description of the sale leaseback transactions 
during  and  the company recorded significant charges to restructure its operations  largely focused in the engine business 
these actions and the resulting charges were primarily taken in response to the downturn in the north american trucking industry and related conditions and included workforce reductions  asset impairment losses  termination of a new engine development program and other charges 
total cash outflows associated with these actions approximated million  the majority of which has already been disbursed  including million in the associated annual savings of these restructuring actions are estimated at million upon completion 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes in detail the restructuring actions we have taken during the last three years 
in november  we entered into a new revolving credit facility that replaced our prior revolving credit facility 
the new credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to million and is available on a revolving basis for a period of three years 
borrowings are primarily available in us dollars  although up to million of the new credit facility is available for multicurrency borrowing and letters of credit  up to million is available for letters of credit and up to million is available for swing line loans 
we and a number of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow and obtain letters of credit under the new revolving credit facility  although the aggregate amount of borrowings by  and letters of credit issued for the benefit of  our subsidiaries under the new facility may not exceed million 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility and million was utilized for letters of credit 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains a more complete description of our new revolving credit facility 
in november  we issued million of unsecured senior notes that mature in proceeds from the issue were approximately million  net of debt issue costs 
proceeds from the notes were used to repay amounts outstanding under our receivable securitization program and million of the proceeds were used to retire our notes that matured in march interest on the notes is payable on june and december each year 
we can redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time after december   at a premium equal to of par  declining to par in  plus accrued interest

available credit capacity the following table provides the components of the company s available credit capacity as of december  millions revolving credit facility international credit facilities accounts receivable securitization contractual obligations and commercial commitments a summary of payments due by period of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  are shown in the tables below 
a more complete description of these obligations and commitments is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements as referenced below 
contractual cash obligations after total millions revolving credit facility loans payable long term debt  capital leases operating leases preferred securities of subsidiary trust other commercial commitments after total millions standby letters of credit guarantees financial covenants and credit rating a number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements  such as our accounts receivable securitization program  our financing arrangements for independent distributors  our new revolving credit facility and our equipment sale leaseback agreement  have restrictive covenants and or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating 
in april  moody s investors services  one of two major credit rating agencies  lowered our long term and short term debt ratings primarily as a result of the continued weakness in the north american heavy duty truck market 
moody s lowered our senior unsecured long term debt rating to ba from baa with a stable outlook 
the short term rating  which applies to our short term borrowings  was lowered to not prime from prime standard poors  the other major credit rating agency  reaffirmed its rating of cummins debt at bbb and expected the company s liquidity and credit protection measures to remain satisfactory for the current rating 
in october  moody s confirmed the long term rating of our senior debt at ba but changed the outlook to negative from stable 
also in october  standard poors lowered our corporate credit rating to bb from bbb with a negative outlook  primarily as a result of declining power generation sales and weak heavy and medium duty truck demand 
in november  moody s lowered our long term senior unsecured debt rating from ba to ba as a result of our securing borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides the circumstances warrant that change  and there can be no assurance that our debt ratings will not be lowered further or withdrawn by a rating agency 
any future lowering of our debt ratings could further increase the cost of our financing agreements and arrangements  and also have a negative impact on our ability to access the capital markets or borrow funds at current rates 
however  we do not believe further downgrade of our credit rating will have a material impact on our financial results or our financial condition 
the following is a discussion regarding the impact of the credit ratings on our financing arrangements 
off balance sheet financing accounts receivable securitization program we entered into our accounts receivable securitization program in december as of december   there were no proceeds outstanding under the securitization program and as of december   million was outstanding under the program 
the original agreement for this program required us to maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating in our long term senior unsecured debt 
as a result of the moody s downgrade in april  we renegotiated the terms of the securitization agreement and renewed the requirement to maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating 
the terms of the new agreement provide for an increase in the interest rate and fees under this program of approximately million annually at current funding levels 
as a result of amending the requirement  neither the october standard poor s downgrade  or the november moody s downgrade affected our funding under this program 
further downgrade of our debt rating from moody s will require us to renegotiate the terms of our securitization agreement in order to continue funding under this program 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a more complete discussion of our accounts receivable securitization program 
financing arrangements for related parties in accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements  we may purchase products and components from the joint ventures  sell products and components to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties 
joint venture transfer prices to us may differ from normal selling prices 
certain joint ventures agreements transfer product to us at cost  some transfer product to us on a cost plus basis  and others transfer product to us at market value 
we purchase significant quantities of mid range diesel and natural gas engines  components and service parts from consolidated diesel company cdc  an unconsolidated general partnership 
the partnership was formed in with j 
i 
case case to jointly fund engine development and manufacturing capacity 
cummins and case now cnh global nv are general partners and each partner shares percent ownership in cdc 
under the terms of the agreement  cdc is obligated to make its entire production of diesel engines and related products available solely to the partners 
each partner is entitled to purchase up to one half of cdc s actual production  a partner may purchase in excess of one half of actual production to the extent productive capacity is available beyond the other partner s purchase requirement 
the partners are each obligated  unconditionally and severally  to purchase annually at least one engine or engine kit produced by cdc  provided a minimum of one engine or kit is produced 
the transfer price of cdc s engines to the partners must be sufficient to cover its manufacturing cost in such annual accounting period  including interest and financing expenses  depreciation expense and payment of principal on any of cdc s indebtedness 
in addition  each partner is obligated to contribute one half of the capital investment required to maintain plant capacity and each partner has the right to invest unilaterally in plant capacity  which additional capacity can be utilized by the other partner for a fee 
to date  neither partner has made a unilateral investment in plant capacity at cdc 
we are not a guarantor of any of cdc s obligations or commitments  however  we are required to provide up to percent of cdc s base working capital as defined by the agreement 
the amount of base working capital is calculated each quarter and if supplemental funding greater than the base working capital amount is required  the amount is funded through third party financing arranged by cdc  or we may elect to fund the requirement although we are under no obligation to do so 
to date  when supplemental funding is required above the base working capital amount  we have elected to provide that funding to cdc 
if the amount of supplemental funding required is less than the base working capital amount  it is funded equally by the partners 
excess cash generated by cdc is remitted to cummins until cdc s working capital amount is reduced to the base working capital amount 
any further cash remittances from cdc to the partners are shared equally by the partners 
financing arrangements and guarantees for distributors us distributors we guarantee the revolving loans  term loans and leases in excess of a specified borrowing base for certain independently owned and operated north american distributors as well as distributors in which we own an equity interest 
the agreement requires us to maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating for our long term senior unsecured debt 
as a result of the moody s downgrade in april  our guarantee under the operating agreement for our guarantee program increased to the full amount of distributor borrowings outstanding under the program 
in the interim  the program lender agreed to waive the additional guarantees of distributor indebtedness that were required upon our ratings downgrade and continued to fund the distributors under this program 
we then amended the operating agreement with the lender under the program to lower the ratings trigger one level 
subsequently  as a result of the moody s downgrade in november  our guarantee under the operating agreement for the guarantee program again increased to the full amount of distributor borrowings under this program 
we again amended the operating agreement with the lender under the program  lowering the rating trigger for a period of approximately two years  at which time the rating trigger will resume to its prior level 
under the amended agreement  if our long term senior unsecured debt rating falls below bb with standard poor s or below ba with moody s  the lender under the program could elect to curtail distributor borrowings and the amount of our guarantee would increase to the total distributor borrowings outstanding under the program 
this rating level trigger remains in effect until august   at which time the ratings trigger reverts to a rating of below bbb for standard poor s or below baa for moody s 
in addition  in the event the rating on our long term senior unsecured debt falls below the thresholds described above  we will also be required to pay the lender a monthly fee equal to percent on the daily average outstanding balance of each financing arrangement under the operating agreement 
further  in the event that any distributor defaults under a particular financing arrangement  we will be required to purchase the assets of that distributor that secure its borrowings under the financing arrangement the operating agreement will continue in effect until february   and may be renewed by the parties for additional one year terms 
as of december   we had guaranteed million of financing arrangements under the operating agreement relating to us distributor borrowings of million 
canadian distributors we have entered into a number of guarantee agreements with a canadian lender pursuant to which we have agreed to guarantee borrowings of certain independent distributors of our products in canada 
under the terms of these agreements  our guarantee with respect to any one financing arrangement between a distributor and lender is limited to percent of the aggregate principal amount of the financing 
as of december   we had million of guarantees outstanding under these guarantee agreements relating to distributor borrowings of million 
new revolving credit facility in november  we entered into a new revolving credit facility that replaced our prior revolving credit facility 
the new revolving credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to million and is available on a revolving basis for a period of three years 
borrowings are primarily available in us dollars  although up to million of the new credit facility is available for multicurrency borrowing and letters of credit  up to million is available for letters of credit and up to million is available for swing line loans 
we and a number of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow and obtain letters of credit under the new revolving credit facility  although the aggregate amount of borrowings by  and letters of credit issued for the benefit of  our subsidiaries under the new facility may not exceed million 
we guarantee all borrowings of our subsidiaries under the new revolving credit facility 
in addition  our principal domestic subsidiaries guarantee all borrowings under the new revolving credit facility  although certain of those guarantees are limited by the terms of our existing public indenture which governs a number of our existing notes and debentures that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness  and are limited by similar terms in the indenture governing our million senior notes 
borrowings under the new revolving credit facility other than swing line loans bear interest at a rate equal to  at our option the london inter bank offered rate libor plus a spread ranging from percent to percent based on our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility  or the alternate base rate rate or abr which is the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus percent plus a spread ranging from percent to percent based on our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility 
following the november downgrade from moody s  the effective rate of interest on our borrowings under the new revolving credit facility increased from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points 
swing line loans bear interest at the abr rate plus a spread based on our credit rating and utilization of the new revolving credit facility  or such other rate as is agreed to by us and the swing line lender 
we are required to pay quarterly facility fees on unused commitments under the new revolving credit facility  which fees are based upon our credit rating 
we also are required to pay an annual administration fee to the administrative agent for the facility 
our obligations and the obligations of our subsidiaries under the new revolving credit facility are collateralized by security interests in substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee obligations under the facility other than shares of stock or indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are restricted subsidiaries under the terms of our existing public indenture and other than assets that are considered principal properties of ours or of our restricted subsidiaries under the terms of our existing public indenture 
the terms of the new revolving credit facility contain covenants that restrict our ability  and the ability of our subsidiaries  to among other things  incur liens  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  enter into merger  consolidation or asset sale transactions  dispose of capital stock of subsidiaries  incur subsidiary indebtedness and enter into swap transactions 
the new revolving credit facility also restricts our ability to  under the terms of our existing public indenture  redesignate unrestricted subsidiaries as restricted subsidiaries or designate future subsidiaries as restricted subsidiaries 
the new revolving credit facility also contains the following financial covenants we may not permit our net worth to fall below an amount equal to the sum of billion and percent of the sum of our consolidated net earnings for each of the fiscal quarters commencing after september  to and including the most recent fiscal quarter prior to the date on which the net worth calculation is made and percent of the amount by which our net worth has increased as a result of our issuance of capital stock after september   we may not permit the ratio of the sum of our consolidated indebtedness and our securitization financings to the sum of our consolidated indebtedness  securitization financings and net worth to be equal to or greater than to  and we may not permit the ratio of our consolidated ebitda minus capital expenditures to our consolidated interest expense for any period of four consecutive quarters  to be less than to for purposes of the financial covenants described above  net worth  consolidated net income  consolidated indebtedness  consolidated ebitda  consolidated interest expense and other financial measurements are calculated in the manner provided by the terms of the new revolving credit facility agreement 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this revolving credit facility and we were in compliance with all of the covenants of this agreement 
equipment sale leaseback agreement in  we entered into a sale leaseback agreement whereby we sold certain manufacturing equipment and leased it back under an operating lease 
as a result of the moody s downgrade in april  and the standard poor s downgrade in october  we were required under the lease agreement to obtain irrevocable  unconditional standby letters of credit in an amount of million 
the letters of credit were posted to the benefit of the equipment lessor and lenders and will remain in effect until we achieve and maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating for twelve consecutive months 
if we had been unable to obtain these letters of credit  we would have satisfied our obligation under the lease agreement by borrowing under our prior revolving credit facility and posting the proceeds as collateral 
the november  moody s downgrade had no effect on this agreement 
the equipment sale leaseback transaction is disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note of our consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
we believe the application of our accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide financial statement users with useful  reliable and timely information about our earnings results  financial condition and cash flows 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that oftentimes require management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in our financial statements 
our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience  changes in business conditions and other relevant factors that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in any given reporting period  our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that may have a material impact on our financial statements and also require management to exercise significant judgment due to a high degree of uncertainty at the time estimates are made 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe our critical accounting policies include those addressing the recoverability and useful lives of assets including goodwill  estimation of liabilities for product coverage programs and accounting for income taxes  pensions and postretirement benefits 
recoverability of long lived assets our investment in engine manufacturing equipment is depreciated using a modified units of production method 
the cost of all other equipment is depreciated using the straight line method 
under the modified units of production method  the service life of our assets is measured in terms of units of product produced rather than the passage of time 
depreciation expense under this method is likewise measured in terms of units of product produced subject to a minimum level or floor 
the assumptions and estimates regarding asset service life  residual value and units of production are based on a number of factors  including but not limited to  wear and tear  deterioration  and obsolescence 
actual results could differ from our estimates due to changes in retirement or maintenance practices  the introduction of new technology and new products or other changes that may affect the expected service lives of the assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets by performing impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate possible impairment 
in addition  we perform an annual impairment test for the goodwill that is recorded in our statement of financial position 
product coverage costs we estimate and record a liability for product coverage programs  other than product recalls  at the time our products are sold 
our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management s best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ 
as a result of uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs  the liability for such programs is recorded when the recall action is announced 
our warranty liability is affected by component failure rates  repair costs  and the time of failure  partially offset by recovery from certain of our vendors 
future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability 
note of the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our product coverage liability account  including adjustments to pre existing warranties during the period 
realization of deferred tax assets we determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets 
at december   the company has recorded net deferred tax assets of million 
these assets include million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards that generally have a limited life and begin expiring in the ultimate realization of our net deferred tax assets will require a higher level of profitability than the company has achieved in recent years 
having assessed the future profit plans and tax planning strategies together with the years of expiration of carryforward benefits  a valuation allowance of million has been recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
should the company s operating performance not improve  future assessments could conclude a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect our ability to achieve a higher level of profitability include  but are not limited to  a decline in sales or gross margin  loss of market share  increased competition  and existing and future regulatory standards 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
however  we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit 
a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor a number of pension and other retirement plans in various countries 
in the us and the us we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded 
we account for our pension and other postretirement benefit programs in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
these standards require that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis 
as a result  our pension and other postretirement benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans 
these assumptions include a discount rate  an expected return on plan assets rate  a future compensation increase rate  and a health care cost trend rate 
in addition  there are also subjective actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age  mortality rates and participant withdrawals 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions  participant life span  withdrawal rates and changes in actual costs of health care 
these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of pension and other post retirement benefit expenses that are recorded 
the most significant assumptions used in determining our pension income expense in accordance with sfas no 
are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate for pension expense calculation purposes 
in and  we assumed the expected long term return on our plan assets would be percent for us plans and percent for us plans 
over the past two years  global capital market developments have resulted in negative returns on our plan assets and a decline in the discount rate used to estimate the related pension liability 
as a result  at november   the present value of our pension obligation the accumulated benefit obligation or abo exceeded the fair value of its assets  which required us to record a fourth quarter minimum pension liability adjustment of million in accordance with sfas no 
the effect of this non cash adjustment was to increase pension liabilities by million  increase intangible assets by million and increase other comprehensive loss  a contra shareholders account  by million million after tax 
if the fair value of the pension plan assets exceeds the abo in future years  the charge to shareholders equity would be reversed 
alternatively  if the fair market value of the pension plan assets experiences further declines or the discount rate is reduced  additional charges to accumulated other comprehensive income loss may be required in future periods 
the financial ratios and net worth covenants contained in our credit arrangements and debt securities agreements were not affected by the minimum pension liability adjustment 
as a result of lower investment returns experienced in the past two years  we have changed our pension plan asset return assumptions which will impact pension expense in future periods 
our expected long term rate of return on assets has been lowered to percent in the us and percent in the uk with consultation from and the concurrence of our actuaries 
the effect of lowering our long term rate of return assumption will increase our pension expense  as measured in accordance with sfas no 
 by approximately million compared to the amount recorded in in addition  the discount rate for our us plans has declined from percent at september   to percent at november   and from percent at september   to percent at november   for our uk plans 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed the date for measuring our return on pension plan assets and our minimum liability for pension obligations from september to november we believe this change in measurement dates aligns more closely with the date of our financial statements and provides a more current measurement of plan assets and obligations than previously presented 
the impact of this change is reported in our consolidated statements of earnings as a change in accounting principle  and had a favorable cumulative after tax effect of million  or per share  recorded as of january  the effect on net earnings of this accounting change was not material 
during and  we made cash contributions to our pension plans of million and million  respectively  and we expect to make cash contributions of approximately million during note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity  the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  business combinations concurrent with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted the new accounting standards on january  sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas also provides new criteria in the determination of intangible assets  including goodwill acquired in a business combination  and expands financial disclosures concerning business combinations 
the adoption of sfas did not affect previously reported amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets included in our statements of financial position 
sfas requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead are allocated to applicable reporting units for purposes of performing annual impairment tests using a two step process 
to the extent that impairment exists  we are required to perform a second test to measure the amount of the impairment 
during the first quarter  we completed the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test which required us to compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of the net assets of our reporting units as of january  for each of our reporting units  the estimated fair value was determined utilizing the expected present value of the future cash flows of the units 
based on this analysis  we concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying  or book value  including goodwill  and therefore we did not recognize any impairment of goodwill 
we elected to perform the annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill as required by sfas as of september   the end of our fiscal third quarter 
the results of this annual impairment test indicated that the fair value of each of our reporting units as of september   exceeded their carrying  or book value  including goodwill  and therefore our recorded goodwill was not subject to impairment 
as required by sfas  our consolidated statements of earnings for periods prior to its adoption have not been restated 
however  the effect on our net earnings and earnings per share of excluding goodwill amortization is shown in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including price swaps  forward contracts and interest rate swaps 
as clearly stated in our policies and procedures  financial instruments are used expressly for hedging purposes  and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes 
our hedging transactions are entered into with banking institutions that have strong credit ratings  and thus the credit risk associated with these transactions is not considered significant 
the results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains further information regarding financial instruments and risk management 
the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analyses performed on december  the sensitivity test assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
foreign exchange rates we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of our international business presence 
we transact extensively in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  our earnings experience some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to benefit from global diversification and naturally offsetting currency positions  we enter into forward contracts to hedge our existing exposures recognized asset and liability and forecasted transactions 
the objective of our hedging program is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures 
as of december   the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts  would be approximately 
million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates we are also exposed to interest rate risk as result of our indebtedness 
our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interests rates is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall cost of borrowing 
to achieve this objective  we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowing arrangements 
in november  we terminated an interest rate swap relating to our notes that mature in the swap converted million notional amount from fixed rate debt into floating rate debt and would have matured in the termination of this swap resulted in a million gain 
the gain is being amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt 
the amount of gain recognized in was million 
the remaining balance of the deferred gain is classified as long term debt in our consolidated statements of financial position 
in march  we terminated three fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements related to our notes with principal amount of million due in and notes with principal amount of million due in the termination of these swaps resulted in a million gain 
the gain is being amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt 
the amount of gain recognized in and was million and million  respectively 
as of december   we do not own any interest rate swap agreements 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
commodity prices we are also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers 
to reduce the effect of raw material price changes for select commodities  we enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of our anticipated raw material purchases 
as of december   the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities  would be approximately 
million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the swaps  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items 
see note of the consolidated financial statements
