significant accounting policies utilized by alabama national are discussed in more detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth beginning on page f herein 
some of the more complex technical accounting policies require management to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the valuation of reported assets and liabilities  including associated revenues  expenses  and disclosure 
the following briefly describes the more complex policies involving a significant amount of judgments about valuation and the application of complex accounting standards and interpretations 
allowance for loan and lease losses alabama national records estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan and lease portfolios as an allowance for loan and lease losses 
the methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan and lease losses involve significant judgments to be made by management 
some of the more critical judgments supporting the amount of alabama national s allowance for loan and lease losses include judgments about credit worthiness of borrowers  estimated value of underlying collateral  assumptions about cash flow  determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses  and the impact of current events  conditions  and other factors impacting the level of probable inherent losses 
under different conditions or using different assumptions  the actual amount of credit losses ultimately confirmed by alabama national may be different than management s estimates provided in the consolidated financial statements 
for a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan and lease losses  see note to alabama national s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and provision and allowance for loan and lease losses 
mergers and acquisitions alabama national s growth in business and profitability over the past several years has been enhanced significantly by mergers and acquisitions 
prior to july  alabama national s acquisitions were accounted for using the pooling of interests and purchase business combination methods of accounting 
effective july   alabama national adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  which allows only the use of the purchase method of accounting 
for purchase acquisitions  alabama national is required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques 
the determination of the useful lives of intangible assets is subjective as is the appropriate amortization period for such intangible assets 
these estimates also include the establishment of various accruals and allowances based on planned facilities dispositions and employee severance considerations  among other acquisition related items 
in addition  purchase acquisitions typically result in goodwill  which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair value of net assets acquired compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
income taxes the calculation of alabama national s income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination 
as part of alabama national s overall business strategy  management must consider tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances under consideration 
this analysis includes evaluating the amount and timing of the realization of income tax liabilities or benefits 
management closely monitors tax developments in order to evaluate the effect they may have on alabama national s overall tax position 
pension and other postretirement benefits alabama national offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to employees 
the calculation of obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions 
actuarial valuations and the determination of future market values of plan assets are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used 
please refer to note to alabama national s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for disclosures related to alabama national s benefit plans 
stock based compensation alabama national uses a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation costs 
compensation costs for stock based compensation arrangements are measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the related service period 
accounting for stock based compensation requires the use of an option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the grant date  the exercise price  the expected life of the option  the volatility of the underlying stock and the expected dividends on it  and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option 
please refer to note to alabama national s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for disclosures related to alabama national s stock based compensation awards 
other there are other complex accounting standards that require alabama national to employ significant judgment in interpreting and applying certain of the principles proscribed by those standards 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  determination of whether a financial instrument or other contract meets the definition of a derivative in accordance with sfas no 
 the accounting for a transfer of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 and the determination of asset impairment  including when such impairment is other than temporary

results of operations year ended december   compared with year ended december  alabama national s net income increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  return on average assets during was  compared with during  and return on average equity was during  compared with during net interest income increased million  or  to million in  from million in  as interest income decreased by million and interest expense decreased million 
the increase in net interest income is attributable to a decrease in the interest rate paid on deposits and a million increase in average loans to billion during  from billion in the increase in average loans is a result of continued management emphasis on loan growth and continued strength in some of the economies in the markets served by alabama national 
in general  loans are alabama national s highest yielding earning asset 
alabama national also experienced growth in its securities portfolio that contributed to the increase in net interest income in average securities totaled million in  compared to in average interest bearing liabilities increased million  to billion in despite the increase in average interest bearing liabilities  interest expense decreased million during all categories of average interest bearing liabilities increased during average time deposits increased million  to billion in  compared to million in the interest rate paid on time deposits decreased basis points to in also  average interest bearing transaction accounts and savings and money market deposits increased a combined million while the rate paid on these types of accounts decreased basis points 
alabama national s net interest spread and net interest margin were and  respectively  in  compared to and  respectively  in the increased net interest margin during is due to alabama national s ability to reprice most of its time deposits at lower rates during the federal reserve bank reduced rates repeatedly during  causing the rates paid on time deposits originated in higher interest rate environments to be significantly above current rates 
as those time deposits matured  the funds either moved into transaction type deposit accounts or into other time deposit accounts at the lower current rates 
the result is that the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points while the rate earned on earning assets decreased by only basis points

alabama national  through two of its subsidiary banks  sponsors two defined benefit pension plans 
each of these plans has been frozen with regard to future benefit accruals and participation by new employees 
during  due to the current interest rate environment and poor performance of the equity markets  the discount rate and expected return on plan assets were lowered by management 
the discount rate and expected return on plan assets were and  respectively  for  compared to and  respectively for due to these changes  the pension plans obligations exceeded the fair value of the plan assets and alabama national chose to fully fund the obligations and contributed million to the plans 
as of december   the fair value of plan assets exceeds the projected and accumulated benefit obligation for each pension plan

income before the provision for income taxes increased million  or  to million in  from million in net income totaled million in  an increase of million  or  compared to million during year ended december   compared with year ended december  alabama national s net income increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  return on average assets during was  compared with during  and return on average equity was during  compared with during net interest income increased million  or  to million in  from million in  as interest income increased by million and interest expense decreased million 
the increase in net interest income is attributable to a million increase in average loans to billion during  from billion in  as a result of continued management emphasis on loan growth 
in general  loans are alabama national s highest yielding earning asset 
alabama national also experienced a growth in its securities portfolio that also contributed to the increase in net interest income in average securities totaled million in  compared to in despite an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million  to billion in  interest expense decreased slightly during this is a result of the interest rate cuts during by the federal reserve bank and the effect these cuts had on rates paid on alabama national s deposits and other funding sources 
except for other short term borrowings  all categories of average interest bearing liabilities increased during average time deposits increased million  to million in  compared to million in the interest rate paid on time deposits decreased basis points to in also  average long term and short term debt increased a combined million  to million during  from million in the increases in the above liability categories are due to alabama national s need to fund loan and asset growth 
these funding sources generally bear higher interest rates than interest bearing transaction accounts  resulting in higher interest expense 
alabama national s net interest spread and net interest margin were and  respectively  in  compared to and  respectively  in these decreases resulted because the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities did not reprice as rapidly as the yield earned on average loans 
during  as the federal reserve cut interest rates  alabama national s loans repriced more rapidly than the deposits and other funding sources used to fund loans and other earning assets 
alabama national recorded a provision for loan and lease losses of million during  compared to million in management believes that both loan and lease loss experience and asset quality indicate that the allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at an adequate level  although there can be no assurance that economic or regulatory factors will not require further increases in the allowance

income before the provision for income taxes increased million  or  to million in  from million in net income totaled million in  an increase of million  or  compared to million during net interest income the largest component of alabama national s net income is its net interest income the difference between the income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds used to support its assets 
net interest income is determined by the yield earned on alabama national s earning assets and rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities  the relative amounts of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income divided by average earning assets represents alabama national s net interest margin 
average balances  income  expenses and rates the following table depicts  on a taxable equivalent basis for the periods indicated  certain information related to alabama national s average balance sheet and its average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities

during  alabama national experienced an increase in net interest income of million  or  to million  compared with million in net interest income increased due to an increase in the net interest spread of basis points to in  from in  and an increase in the net interest margin of basis points to in  compared with in the net interest margin for was negatively impacted by the federal reserve s interest rate deductions 
during alabama national s time deposits repriced at the current interest rates and this repricing improved the net interest margin 
the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was  as compared to recorded in the third quarter of the fourth quarter of was negatively impacted by the federal reserve s basis point rate reduction during the quarter and by the accelerated repayment on securities owned by alabama national 
as the securities being repaid were at higher interest rates than the rates earned on federal funds sold and new securities purchased  the net interest margin declined 
alabama national did not fully invest the cash flow received from the accelerated repayment on securities owned immediately upon its receipt in an attempt to reinvest appropriately given the changing rate environment 
much of the reinvestment of this cash flow did not take place until the end of december 
this is reflected in higher ending securities balances than average securities balances in the fourth quarter 
as management wishes to be more conservative on the maturity and average life extension risk of new securities purchases in the current environment due to the low absolute level of interest rates  alabama national is willing to accept lower yields on new securities purchases in return for reduced extension risk 
management anticipates the net interest margin to remain at reduced levels absent any additional rate reductions by the federal reserve or significant changes in the general interest rate environment 
during  net average earning assets increased by million  or  to billion  from billion in the major components of this increase included average loans and leases  which increased million  or  to billion in  from billion in  and securities  which increased million  or  to million in  from million in analysis of changes in net interest income the following table sets forth  on a taxable equivalent basis  the effect which varying levels of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the applicable rates had on changes in net interest income for and for purposes of this table  changes that are not solely attributable to volume or rate are allocated to volume and rate on a pro rata basis

the principal monitoring technique employed by alabama national is simulation analysis  which technique is augmented by gap analysis 
in simulation analysis  alabama national reviews each individual asset and liability category and their projected behavior in various different interest rate environments 
these projected behaviors are based upon management s past experiences and upon current competitive environments  including the various environments in the different markets in which alabama national competes 
using this projected behavior and differing rate scenarios as inputs  the simulation analysis generates as output projections of net interest income 
alabama national also periodically verifies the validity of this approach by comparing actual results with those that were projected in previous models 
see market risk 
another technique used by alabama national in interest rate management is the measurement of the interest sensitivity gap  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets and liabilities  selling securities available for sale or trading securities  replacing an asset or liability at maturity or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
alabama national evaluates interest sensitivity risk and then formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and repricing  and sources and prices of off balance sheet commitments in order to decrease interest sensitivity risk 
alabama national uses computer simulations to measure the net income effect of various interest rate scenarios 
the modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net income over specified periods of time 
the following table illustrates alabama national s interest rate sensitivity at december   assuming the relevant assets and liabilities are collected and paid  respectively  based upon historical experience rather than their stated maturities 
interest sensitivity analysis amounts in thousands  except ratios december  within one month after one through three months after three through twelve months within one year one through three years greater than three years total assets earning assets loans and leases securities trading securities interest bearing deposits in other banks funds sold total interest earning assets liabilities interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits demand deposits savings and money market deposits time deposits funds purchased short term borrowings long term debt total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap ratio of cumulative gap to total interest earning assets excludes nonaccrual loans of  excludes investment in equity securities with a fair market value of excludes matured certificates which have not been redeemed by the customer and on which no interest is accruing includes treasury  tax and loan accounts of  alabama national generally benefits from increasing market rates of interest when it has an asset sensitive gap a positive number and generally benefits from decreasing market interest rates when it is liability sensitive a negative number 
as shown in the table above  alabama national is asset sensitive from the one month through three year periods 
it is only beyond the three year period that alabama national is liability sensitive 
alabama national has traditionally been liability sensitive through the one year time frame 
it is now asset sensitive due to a reduction in the average life of the securities and loan portfolios 
also  the loan portfolio contains an increased proportion of variable rate loans and these loans generally reprice more quickly than fixed rate loans 
the analysis presents only a static view of the timing and repricing opportunities  without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame  but those are viewed by management as significantly less interest sensitive than market based rates such as those paid on non core deposits 
for this and other reasons  management relies more upon the simulation analysis as noted above in managing interest rate risk 
net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment  including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
market risk alabama national s earnings are dependent on its net interest income which is the difference between interest income earned on all earning assets  primarily loans and securities  and interest paid on all interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
alabama national s market risk arises primarily from inherent interest rate risk in its lending  investing and deposit gathering activities 
alabama national seeks to reduce its exposure to market risk through actively monitoring and managing its interest rate risk 
management relies upon static gap analysis to determine the degree of mismatch in the maturity and repricing distribution of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which quantifies  to a large extent  the degree of market risk inherent in alabama national s balance sheet 
gap analysis is further augmented by simulation analysis to evaluate the impact of varying levels of prevailing interest rates and the sensitivity of specific earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in those prevailing rates 
simulation analysis consists of evaluating the impact on net interest income given changes from basis points below to basis points above the current prevailing rates 
management makes certain assumptions as to the effect varying levels of interest rates have on certain earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which assumptions consider both historical experience and consensus estimates of outside sources 
with respect to the primary earning assets  loans and securities  certain features of individual types of loans and specific securities introduce a level of uncertainty as to their expected performance at varying levels of interest rates 
in some cases  imbedded options exist whereby the borrower may elect to repay the obligation at any time 
these imbedded prepayment options make anticipating the performance of those instruments difficult given changes in prevailing rates 
at december   mortgage backed securities with a carrying value totaling million  or of total assets and essentially every underlying loan  net of unearned income  totaling billion  or of total assets  carry such imbedded options 
management believes that assumptions used in its simulation analysis about the performance of financial instruments with such imbedded options are appropriate 
however  the actual performance of these financial instruments may differ from management s estimates due to several factors  including the diversity and sophistication of the customer base  the general level of prevailing interest rates and the relationship to their historical and expected levels  and general economic conditions 
the difference between those assumptions and actual results  if significant  could cause the actual results to differ from those indicated by the simulation analysis 
deposits totaled billion  or of total assets  at december  since deposits are the primary funding source for earning assets  the associated market risk is considered by management in its simulation analysis 
generally  it is anticipated that deposits will be sufficient to support funding requirements 
however  the rates paid for deposits at varying levels of prevailing interest rates have a significant impact on net interest income and therefore  must be quantified by alabama national in its simulation analysis 
specifically  alabama national s spread  the difference between the rates earned on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  is generally higher when prevailing rates are higher than current levels 
alabama national s spread is also impacted by the shape of the yield curve  which is a measure of the difference between rates at different maturities 
a steep yield curve  implying higher long term rates and lower short term rates  would generally result in a higher net interest margin for alabama national 
as prevailing rates reduce  the spread tends to compress as rates paid on deposit and other liability categories approach their lower limits  with severe compression at very low prevailing interest rates 
this characteristic is called spread compression and adversely affects net interest income in the simulation analysis when anticipated prevailing rates are reduced from current rates 
management relies upon historical experience to estimate the degree of spread compression in its simulation analysis 
management believes that such estimates of possible spread compression are reasonable 
however  if the degree of spread compression varies from that expected  the actual results could differ from those indicated by the simulation analysis 
the following table illustrates the results of simulation analysis used by alabama national to determine the extent to which market risk would affect net interest margin for the next twelve months if prevailing interest rates increased or decreased the specified amounts from rates in effect during alabama national s simulation analysis indicates limited reduction in net interest margin from a basis point reduction in interest rates from current rate levels 
rate reductions beyond this point  however  would reduce the net interest margin significantly due to the current low interest rate environment 
alabama national s net interest income would decrease significantly if prevailing interest rates were to further decrease or basis points 
the current rates paid on interest bearing accounts cannot decrease below zero  yet rates earned on loans can experience a decrease in the falling rate scenarios  and the interest rate spread would therefore compress 
because of the inherent use of estimates and assumptions in the simulation model used to derive this information  the actual results of the future impact of market risk on alabama national s net interest margin  may differ from that found in the table

provision and allowance for loan and lease losses alabama national has policies and procedures for evaluating the overall credit quality of its loan and lease portfolio including timely identification of potential problem credits 
on a monthly basis  management reviews the appropriate level for the allowance for loan and lease losses 
this review and analysis is based on the results of the internal monitoring and reporting system  analysis of economic conditions in its markets and a review of historical statistical data  current trends regarding the volume and severity of past due and problem loans and leases  the existence and effect of concentrations of credit  and changes in national and local economic conditions for both alabama national and other financial institutions 
management also considers in its evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses the results of regulatory examinations conducted for each bank  including evaluation of alabama national s policies and procedures and findings from alabama national s independent loan review department 
the provision for loan and lease losses increased by million  or  to million in  from million in the increased provision expense during is primarily attributable to an increase in net charge offs 
during  net charge offs increased by million  or to million  from million in recoveries for include approximately million in recoveries from loans that farmers national bancshares had charged off prior to its acquisition by alabama national 
in spite of these recoveries  management s assessment is that the loans purchased in this acquisition continue to pose a higher overall risk than the alabama national loan and lease portfolio as a whole  consistent with management s assessment prior to the acquisition 
a significant portion of the net charge offs for related to one loan relationship which management had previously identified as a potential problem loan 
also contributing to the increased provision expense for is an increase in the level of nonperforming loans  the current economic environment  and general growth in the loan and lease portfolio 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is based on alabama national s past loan and lease loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  and an analysis of current economic conditions 
management believes the allowance for loan and lease losses  at its current level  adequately covers alabama national s exposure to loan and lease losses 
while management believes that it has established the allowance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and has taken into account the views of its regulators and the current economic environment  there can be no assurance that in the future alabama national s regulators or its economic environment will not require further increases in the allowance 
additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses  which are expensed as the provision for loan and lease losses on alabama national s income statement  are made periodically to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at an appropriate level as determined by management 
loan and lease losses and recoveries are charged or credited directly to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the following table presents the information associated with alabama national s allowance and provision for loan and lease losses for the dates indicated

accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
in addition to consideration of these factors  alabama national has a consistent and continuing policy of placing all loans on nonaccrual status if they become days or more past due  regardless of the collateral or the borrower s financial condition 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all interest which is accrued on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when a problem loan is finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual writedown or charge off of the principal balance of the loan which would necessitate additional charges to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
during the years ending december   and  approximately   and  respectively  in additional interest income would have been recognized in earnings if alabama national s nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms 
total nonperforming assets increased million  to million at december l   from million at december  the increase in nonperforming assets is attributable to weaknesses in certain credits and to the current slowdown in the national economy 
the allowance for loan and lease losses to period end nonperforming assets was at december   compared with at december  this ratio will generally fluctuate from period to period depending upon nonperforming asset levels at period end 
total nonperforming loans increased million during  to million and other real estate owned increased million  to million at december  potential problem loans a potential problem loan is one that management has concerns as to the borrower s future performance under terms of the loan contract 
these loans are current as to principal and interest  and accordingly  they are not included in the nonperforming asset categories 
management monitors these loans closely in order to ensure that alabama national s interests are protected 
at december   alabama national had certain loans considered by management to be potential problem loans totaling million as compared with million at december  the primary reason for the decrease in potential problem loans relates to management s upgrade of one loan relationship that totaled approximately million at december  alabama national believes early identification of potential problem loans is an important factor in its ability to successfully collect such loans 
as such  it encourages early identification of potential problem loans both with its loan officers and loan review staff 
the level of potential problem loans is factored into the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
noninterest income and expense noninterest income alabama national relies on five distinct product lines for the production of recurring noninterest income traditional retail and commercial banking  mortgage banking  securities brokerage and trust services  investment services  and insurance services

nbc securities expanded its retail investment platform in with the addition of several registered representatives and the opening of several new offices during the year 
nbc securities also benefited from increased customer demand for fixed rate annuity products during the decrease in interest income in both and is due to decreased margin loan activity during each year

earning assets loans and leases loans and leases are the largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets 
associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks which management attempts to control and counterbalance 
total loans and leases averaged billion in  compared to billion in  an increase of million  or 
at december   total loans and leases  net of unearned income  were billion  compared to billion at the end of  an increase of million  or 
average loans grew more than year end balances due to the purchase method acquisition of farmers national bancshares  inc in december the growth in alabama national s loan and lease portfolio is attributable to alabama national s ability to attract new customers while maintaining consistent underwriting standards 
loan growth is also impacted by general economic conditions that may result in increased loan demand from existing customers

in the context of this discussion  a real estate mortgage loan is defined as any loan  other than loans for construction purposes  secured by real estate  regardless of the purpose of the loan 
it is common practice for financial institutions in alabama national s market areas  and for alabama national in particular  to obtain a security interest or lien in real estate whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral 
this collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio component 
the principal component of alabama national s loan portfolio is real estate mortgage loans 
at year end  this category totaled billion and represented of the total loan portfolio  compared to billion  or  of the total loan portfolio  at year end residential mortgage loans increased million  or  to million at december   compared with million at december  commercial mortgage loans increased million  or  to million at december  increases in both of these categories of loans are primarily the result of alabama national s expertise in and appetite for these commercial and residential real estate loans 
in addition  the general economic conditions in alabama national s markets  which generate such lending opportunities  are partially responsible for this growth 
real estate construction loans increased million  or  to million at december   compared with million at december  alabama national s focus on the home construction market and strong construction activity in markets it serves caused this increase 
consumer loans decreased million  or  during to million  from million in lease financing receivables increased million  or  during to million  from in million as a result of a successful marketing efforts and business development efforts of individuals in this area 
alabama national engages in no foreign lending operations 
the repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for alabama national 
the following table sets forth alabama national s loans maturing within specific intervals at december  loan maturity and sensitivity to changes in interest rates amounts in thousands december  one year or less over one year through five years over five years total commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate residential real estate commercial consumer predetermined rates floating rates maturing after one year but within five years maturing after five years the information presented in the above table is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity 
renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval  as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 
consequently  management believes this treatment presents fairly the maturity and repricing structure of the loan portfolio 
securities securities  including securities classified as held to maturity or investment securities and available for sale  represent a significant portion of alabama national s earning assets 
securities averaged million during  compared with million during  an increase of million  or 
growth in the securities portfolio is generally a function of growth in funding sources net of lending opportunities 
during  as loan demand experienced a relative decrease as compared with recent years  alabama national had excess liquidity with which to purchase securities 
management attempts to maintain earning asset growth commensurate with its funding growth and with its overall growth plans 
during  alabama national experienced increasing liquidity and a reduction in its rate of loan growth and increased the size of the securities portfolio through purchases 
at december   the securities portfolio totaled million  including securities held to maturity with an amortized cost of million and securities available for sale with a market value of million

at december   mortgage backed securities consisting of collateralized mortgage obligations and pass through mortgage obligations had a carrying value totaling million 
these mortgage backed securities include million classified as investment securities and million classified as securities available for sale 
management expects the annual repayment of the underlying mortgages to vary as a result of monthly repayment of principal and or interest required under terms of the underlying promissory notes 
further  the actual rate of repayment is subject to changes depending upon the terms of the underlying mortgages  the relative level of mortgage interest rates  and the structure of the securities 
when relative interest rates decline to levels below that of the underlying mortgages  acceleration of principal repayment is expected as some borrowers on the underlying mortgages refinance to lower rates 
when the underlying rates on mortgage loans are comparable to  or in excess of  market rates  repayment more closely conforms to scheduled amortization in accordance with terms of the promissory note with additional repayment as a result of sales of homes collateralizing the mortgage loans constituting the security 
accordingly  management generally expects repayment of the collateralized mortgage obligations over a one to three year period  and repayment of the pass through mortgage obligations over a two to four year period 
these periods have shortened considerably due to the current interest rate environment 
other attributes of securities are discussed in interest sensitivity and market risk 
short term investments alabama national utilizes overnight investment of funds in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell to ensure that adequate liquidity will be maintained  while at the same time minimizing the level of uninvested cash reserves 
short term investments are also utilized by alabama national when the level of funds committed to lending and investment portfolio programs changes or the level of deposit generation changes 
during  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell averaged million  compared to million during  representing a slight decrease of million 
trading account securities an important aspect of investment department operations  but less so to alabama national overall  are trading account securities  which represent securities owned by alabama national prior to sale and delivery to alabama national s customers 
trading account securities averaged approximately million in both and this small dollar amount reflects management s policy of limiting positions in such securities to reduce its exposure to market and interest rate changes 
deposits and other interest bearing liabilities average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  to billion in  from billion in average interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to billion in  from billion in this increase is attributable to competitive rate and product offerings by alabama national and successful marketing efforts 
average federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased million  or  to million in  from million in  due in part  to additional liquidity provided by downstream correspondent banks 
average short term borrowings increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in average long term borrowings increased million or  to million in  from million in the increase in the combined short and long term average debt outstanding is due to utilizing more borrowing programs offered to alabama national s federal home loan bank member subsidiaries 
deposits average total deposits increased million  or  to billion during  from billion during at december   total deposits were billion  compared with billion at december  the following table sets forth the deposits of alabama national by category at the dates indicated 
deposits amounts in thousands  except percentages december  amount percent of total amount percent of total amount percent of total amount percent of total amount percent of total demand now savings and money market time less than  time greater than  total deposits core deposits  which exclude time deposits of  or more  provide for a relatively stable funding source that supports earning assets 
alabama national s core deposits totaled billion  or  of total deposits at december   and totaled billion  or  of total deposits at december  deposits  in particular core deposits  have historically been alabama national s primary source of funding and have enabled alabama national to meet successfully both short term and long term liquidity needs 
management anticipates that such deposits will continue to be alabama national s primary source of funding in the future  although economic factors could affect this funding source 
alabama national s loan to deposit ratio was at december   and at the end of  and the ratio averaged during and during the maturity distribution of alabama national s time deposits in excess of  at december   is shown in the following table 
maturities of certificates of deposit and other time deposits of  or more amounts in thousands december  within one month after one through three months after three through six months after six through twelve months one through three years greater than three years total certificates of deposit of  or more other time deposits of  or more total approximately of alabama national s time deposits over  had scheduled maturities within three months 
large certificate of deposit customers tend to be sensitive to interest rate levels  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits 
alabama national had million in large certificates of deposit obtained through brokers outstanding at december   compared to million at december  alabama national s use of brokered time deposits fluctuates depending upon funding needs and the pricing and maturity structure of brokered deposits versus other funding sources  including in market time deposits 
borrowed funds borrowed funds include five broad categories  i federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  ii treasury  tax and loan balances  iii federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  iv borrowings from a third party bank  and v trust preferred securities 
because of a relatively high loan to deposit ratio  the existence and stability of these funding sources are critical to alabama national s maintenance of short term and long term liquidity 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent both an input of excess funds from correspondent bank customers of alabama national as well as a cash management tool offered to corporate customers 
at december   these funds totaled million  compared with million at december  this balance will vary greatly depending on the liquidity of the downstream correspondent banks of alabama national and the excess cash of its corporate customers 
at december   treasury  tax and loan balances totaled million  compared to million at december  alabama national collects tax deposits from customers and is permitted to retain these balances until established collateral limits are exceeded or until the us treasury withdraws its balances 
alabama national s average borrowing from a third party bank under a million credit facility the credit facility was million during  compared with million during as of december   the outstanding balance under the credit facility was million  leaving a remaining availability under the credit facility of million 
in january  alabama national made a principal payment of million leaving an outstanding balance of million 
although alabama national had the proceeds for the principal reduction prior to year end the credit facility requires that principal repayments occur only on interest pay dates 
the credit facility bears interest at a rate that varies with libor and is secured by a pledge of stock in the banks 
the credit facility is typically renewed on an annual basis and has a current maturity date of may  alabama national has historically renewed the credit facility prior to its due date and anticipates doing so again in all of the banks are members of the fhlb 
at december   the banks had available fhlb lines of million  under which million was outstanding  including advances classified as short term of million and advances classified as long term of million 
this compares to borrowings of million at december   of which million was short term and million was long term 
the increase in borrowings from the fhlb is attributable to the continued increase in interest bearing assets of alabama national  as other funding sources such as deposit liabilities were not cost effective to support such growth 
on december   alabama national  through its wholly owned subsidiary  alabama national statutory trust ii  issued floating rate capital securities  commonly known as trust preferred securities  in the principal amount of million 
the trust preferred securities issued in  is in addition to million of trust preferred securities issued in december the securities pay distributions at a rate that varies with libor 
they are classified as long term debt for the financial statements but are included as capital for regulatory purposes 
the net proceeds of the trust preferred securities issued were used to reduce alabama national s balance under the credit facility and for general corporate expenses

net increase under the capital guidelines of their regulators  alabama national and the banks are currently required to maintain a minimum risk based total capital ratio of  with at least being tier i capital 
tier i capital consists of common stockholders equity  qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill 
in addition  under the guidelines  alabama national and the banks must maintain a minimum tier i leverage ratio of tier i capital to total assets of at least  but this minimum ratio is typically increased by to basis points for other than the highest rated institutions

liquidity management liquidity management involves monitoring alabama national s sources and uses of funds in order to meet its day to day cash flow requirements while maximizing profits 
liquidity represents the ability of an entity to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
without proper liquidity management  alabama national will not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
increased liquidity in typical interest rate environments often involves decreasing profits by investing in earning assets with shorter maturities 
liquidity management is made more complex because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of certain securities within the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made 
however  net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to nearly the same degree of control 
assets included in alabama national s consolidated statements of condition contribute to liquidity management 
federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell  alabama national s primary source of immediate liquidity  averaged million during and were million at december   and averaged million during and were million at december  if required in short term liquidity management  these assets could be converted to cash immediately 
cash received from the repayment of investment securities and loans provides a repetitive source of cash that contributes to liquidity management 
unpledged securities  with a carrying value of approximately million at december   provide alabama national an opportunity to generate cash by  providing additional collateral by selling securities under agreements to repurchase  providing collateral to obtain public funds or providing collateral to borrow directly from the federal reserve bank or the federal home loan bank 
see earning assets loans and earning assets securities 
liquidity can also be managed using liabilities included in alabama national s consolidated statement of condition  such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and short term borrowings 
combined federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  treasury  tax and loan  and short term borrowings averaged million during and were million at december   and averaged million during and were million at december  overnight borrowing lines with upstream correspondent banks  totaling million at december   of which million was unused  provide additional sources of liquidity to alabama national on an unsecured basis 
the federal home loan bank provides secured and unsecured credit lines to all of alabama national s banks totaling approximately million as of year end at december   advances under these lines totaled million  including million classified as short term and million classified as long term 
long term liquidity needs are met through alabama national s deposit base approximately of alabama national s deposits at december   are considered core deposits  and the repayment of loans and other investments as they mature 
alabama national is able to manage its long term liquidity needs by adjusting the rates it pays on longer term deposits  long term borrowings and the amount and mix of longer term investments in its portfolio 
one of the banks  nbc  has pledged approximately million in loans to the federal reserve bank of atlanta as collateral for a discount window credit facility  which management views as a backup liquidity facility 
at december   nbc had access to approximately million under this facility  with no outstanding borrowings 
alabama national  as a stand alone corporation  has more limited access to liquidity sources than its banks and depends on dividends from its subsidiaries as its primary source of liquidity 
alabama national s liquidity is diminished by required payments on its outstanding short term debt and trust preferred securities 
the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to general regulatory restrictions  which may  but are not expected to  have a material negative impact on the liquidity available to alabama national 
see note to the alabama national s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report beginning at page f 
if circumstances warrant  alabama national s short term liquidity needs can also be met by additional borrowings of approximately million representing the unused portion of alabama national s credit facility with an unrelated bank
