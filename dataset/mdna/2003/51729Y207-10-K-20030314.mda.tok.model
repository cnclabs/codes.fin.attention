item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to uncollectible receivables  investment values  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from product sales is generally recognized when products are shipped to our customers 
however  some of our distributors  who maintain significant inventories of our products  have a right to return products that remain unsold 
in the case where the distributor has a right to return products  we do not recognize revenue until the distributor notifies us that the products have been shipped to the end user 
service revenue earned from providing maintenance  installation  training or other miscellaneous services is recognized when those services are provided to the customer 
if we believe that collection is not probable at the time of shipment  we elect to defer the revenue until the cash is collected 
investment and accounts receivable risk we invest cash in excess of our daily needs in financial instruments issued by banks  government agencies or large corporations 
our policy is to invest these funds in financial instruments that are rated by standard and poors or other rating agency equivalents as a or better in the case of general debt instruments or a in the case of commercial paper 
our policy restricts us from investing more than million or of the total investment in any one institution or from investing in financial instruments that mature in more than year 
while we believe  in our judgment  these policies are protective of the company s funds  a default of any one institution would lead to our incurring a significant loss of cash 
our accounts receivable are largely from customers in the united states 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers  and generally require no collateral from our customers 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses based on our evaluation of the customer s financial condition  industry conditions and general economic conditions 
while our reserves have historically been within our expectations  we cannot guarantee that our evaluation of the credit risk of our customers will be correct 
in addition  since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers a significant change in the financial position of any one of these customers could have a material impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
to date  we have reserves for  in receivables associated with the bankruptcy filing of worldcom 
receivables from our two largest customers worldcom and at t represented and of net accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost or market 
write downs of inventory are generally taken  when in our estimate  future demand will not consume existing inventories over the next twelve months 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents restructuring reserves restructuring reserves are based on estimates of the salary and benefit obligations to terminated employees  amounts necessary to write off assets no longer utilized by the company and for contractual payments we expect to continue to make for property no longer in use 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
warranty we provide a three year warranty for most of our products 
we provide for the estimated cost of warranty at the time we record revenue for a product based on our historical costs  which includes material  labor and overhead 
while we believe that our reserves for estimated future warranty costs are adequate  there are inherent risks associated with these estimates  especially for those estimates related to products that have been recently introduced 
sales return allowance we provide a sales return allowance for possible customer returns  based on historical information that may be due to changes in customer circumstances or a misjudgment of either party in assessing the customer s needs 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the temporary timing differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets if  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that the potential future benefits of these assets will not be realized 
results of operations the market for telecommunications equipment is going through a period of rationalization and contraction as sps digest the network overbuild of the late s and early s 
this excess has left most sps  our primary customers  cutting capital equipment budgets  and focusing on squeezing efficiencies out of the existing network infrastructure 
while our business is generally suffering as a result  our restructuring programs have substantially reduced our operating expense levels in versus the operating expense levels during 
table of contents the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated years ended december  product revenues service revenues total revenues product cost of revenues service cost of revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring total operating expenses loss from operations other income  net loss before income taxes income tax benefit provision net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our consolidated revenues of  for the year ended december  were lower than s annual revenues of  the primary reason was the industry wide slowdown 
our multiplexer and inverse multiplexer product lines accounted for the major portion of the decrease from last year with a combined revenue reduction of  or of the total revenue reduction 
by channel of distribution  the majority of the revenue reduction for versus the comparable period of was attributable to lower direct sales to sps and domestic distributors 
shipments to international locations represented of total revenues during compared to of total revenues during on a twelve month comparative basis  international revenues were less than international revenues 
the combined revenues from worldcom  inc and at t  our two largest customers  accounted for of the total revenues for versus for the financial difficulties at worldcom  including its bankruptcy filing  had  and we expect it to continue to have  a major adverse impact on our revenues 
the following table is the percentage of total revenues for our two largest customers twelve months ended december  worldcom  inc at t gross profit 
our total gross profit dollars for were  versus  million for the reduction in gross profit dollars for the periods versus the periods was primarily due to 
table of contents sales volume declines partially offset by improvements to our gross margin percentage 
our gross profit percentage in was or percentage points lower than this year s result of percent 
the percentage point improvement from to was primarily due to an asset impairment charge in  higher excess and obsolete inventory charges as well as higher orion manufacturing costs  overall material costs and warranty costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses totaled  for  which was  or below s spending of  the reduction was primarily due to lower employee related expenses  and lower recruiting and relocation costs  all of which resulted from the restructuring and reduction in force programs enacted in and we had research and development employees at the end of the compared to at the end of selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to  during  as compared to  for the lower expenses were due primarily to reductions in employee related expenses  commission expense  outside services  travel  and communication expenses  associated with the and restructuring and reduction in force programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses include contractual charges from axel johnson for providing certain services to us related to treasury  accounting  tax  internal audit  legal and human resources 
the costs of these services have been allocated to us based on estimates by axel johnson of actual costs incurred 
we believe that such allocations are reasonable 
such charges and allocations are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if we had internally provided such services 
the allocated costs of these services amounted to  for  which was the same as restructuring 
in may and october of  we announced additional corporate restructurings as a result of the ongoing stagnation of the telecom market 
over these two restructurings  positions were eliminated from our workforce with a charge to operating results of  partially offsetting this charge was a  reduction to the prior restructuring reserves primarily for outplacement services  which were not fully utilized by some of the laid off employees and  in rent collected under the sublease agreement with silicon wireless corporation 
that compares to a  restructuring charge for when we reduced our workforce by people  closed our leased facility in durham  north carolina and wrote off assets associated with the closing

provision for income taxes 
the tax benefit of  for is comprised primarily of an income tax refund of  for taxes paid in  and  as a result of a change in the federal income tax code and  for the release of an accrual related to prior years closed audits 
the tax code change allowed corporations with certain tax losses to file for refunds for taxes paid in previous years 
last year s tax provision was  net loss 
the net loss for was  as compared to a net loss of  for the same period of the lower net loss for versus was primarily due to the booking in of an valuation allowance charge against the deferred tax assets  restructuring costs  asset impairment charges  excess and obsolete inventory write downs  and higher manufacturing costs for the larscom m multiplexer product year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our consolidated revenues of  for the year ended december  were lower than s annual revenues of  the primary reason was the industry wide slowdown  which has continued 
our multiplexer and inverse multiplexer product lines accounted for the major portion of the decrease from last year with a combined revenue reduction of  the most dramatic effect of the slowdown  however  was the failure of some of our newer products  such as the service delivery platforms  to grow as we hoped 
by channel of distribution  the bulk of the revenue reduction for versus the comparable period of was attributable to lower direct sales to sps and domestic distributors 
shipments to international locations represented of total revenues during compared to of total revenues during also  on a twelve month comparative basis  international revenues were less than international revenues

research and development 
research and development expenses totaled  for  which was  or below s spending of  the reduction was mainly due to lower staffing levels  lower software expenses  and a decline in material cost 
the june restructuring program and the october reduction in force were the primary reasons for the lower staffing levels in research and development 
we had research and development employees at the end of compared to at the end of selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to  during  as compared to  for the same period of the lower spending was due

selling  general and administrative expenses include contractual charges from axel johnson for legal  accounting  tax  treasury  human resources and administrative services of  for  as compared to  for restructuring 
on june   we announced a corporate restructuring program in response to our own reduced revenues  negative macro economic conditions and declining demand in our markets 
this initiative was designed to focus our business on improving operating performance by reducing expenses 
the restructuring program included a workforce reduction of approximately people  the closing of our facility in north carolina and a write down of fixed assets 
the effect of implementing this program was a one time charge to results in the second quarter of  consisting of  for employee termination costs   for the closing of our facility in north carolina and  for a fixed asset write down 
the facility in north carolina was sublet in see notes to financial statements  note 
on october   due to the continued decline in the telecommunications business and the difficult economic environment  we announced a reduction in force of approximately people to align our expenses with our anticipated revenue levels 
this resulted in an additional charge to operations in the fourth quarter of totaling  the following table provides details on the staff reductions for our restructuring and reduction in force programs in manufacturing research development selling  general administration total june of october of total interest and other income

provision for income taxes 
in  as our business continued to fail to achieve profitability  we recorded a non cash charge of  to provide a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
sfas requires the establishment of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized 
we will continue to review whether a valuation allowance is warranted 
net loss 
the net loss for was  as compared to a net loss of  for the same period of the higher net loss for versus was primarily due to a valuation allowance charge against the deferred tax assets  restructuring costs  asset impairment charges  excess and obsolete inventory write downs  and higher manufacturing costs for the larscom m multiplexer product 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and short term investments of  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments declined by approximately from  on december  to  on december  the  decrease in cash and short term investments in is primarily attributable to the net loss  after depreciation and amortization  for the year of  capital expenditures for were  these expenditures consisted principally of the purchase of computers  software and test equipment 
we anticipate capital expenditures to total approximately  for we have a revolving line of credit of  under a credit agreement with axel johnson inc the credit agreement 
the credit agreement expires in december we currently have a letter from axel johnson inc dated august   stating that it is axel johnson s intent to allow borrowings under the credit line  provided we do not experience any material adverse change after august  upon an event of default or upon election by axel johnson if it no longer holds at least a majority of our outstanding voting power or it has elected less than a majority of our directors  any borrowings under the line of credit shall become payable in full 
we believe our cash and short term investments  after consideration of future operations  will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements  at least through the end of nonetheless  future events  such as a further economic downturn  the potential use of cash to fund any significant losses that we might incur or acquisitions we might undertake  might require us to request borrowings under the credit agreement or seek additional capital from other sources 
in that event  it is possible we would not be able to make the representations and warranties necessary to effect a borrowing under the credit agreement or obtain adequate capital from other sources  other than  axel johnson inc operating lease commitments are related principally to our buildings in milpitas  california and durham  north carolina and have terms that expire in and  respectively 
total rent expense in  and  was   and  respectively

future annual minimum lease payments under all non cancelable operating leases and sublease rental income as of december  are as follows in thousands lease payments sublease rental income years ending december  and thereafter the effects of inflation on our revenues and operating income have not been material to date 
related party transactions as of december   axel johnson owned of class a and b common stock of larscom and controlled of the voting interest 
see note related party transactions to the consolidated financial 
table of contents statements 
related party transactions with axel johnson disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are as follows employee health and welfare programs we participate in various employee benefits programs sponsored by axel johnson 
these programs include medical  dental and life insurance and workers compensation 
in general  we reimburse axel johnson for our proportionate cost of these programs based on historical experience and relative headcount 
the costs reimbursed to axel johnson include costs for reported claims as well as changes in reserves for incurred but not reported claims 
we recorded expenses related to the reimbursement of these costs of approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
we believe the allocation by axel johnson of the proportionate cost is not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred had we maintained our own benefit plans 
administrative services axel johnson provides certain functional services to us  including certain treasury  accounting  tax  internal audit  legal and human resources 
the costs of these services have been allocated to us based on estimates by axel johnson of actual costs incurred 
we believe that such allocations are reasonable 
such charges and allocations are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if we had been a separate entity 
the allocated costs of these services amounting to   and  in  and  respectively  have been included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
credit agreement we and axel johnson entered into a credit agreement  pursuant to which axel johnson has agreed to provide a revolving credit working capital facility to us in an aggregate amount of  the credit agreement expires in december any loans under the credit agreement bear interest during each calendar quarter at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the three month london interbank offered rate libor  plus  initially on the date when the loan is made and adjusted thereafter on the first business day of each successive calendar quarter 
additionally  we are required to pay a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the credit agreement

the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not currently anticipate this statement to have any effect on our financial statements 
certain factors affecting future operating results our entire industry is in an extended downturn 
the downturn for the united states economy and the rapid and severe downturn for the domestic telecommunications industry  beginning in late  have negatively affected demand for our products 
in addition to the deteriorating domestic economic environment  the worldwide telecommunications market is experiencing reduced demand 
this decreased demand has led to fluctuating order forecasts from some of our customers 
there can be no certainty as to the degree of severity or duration of this economic downturn or the reduced demand in the telecommunications industry 
we also cannot predict the extent and timing of the impact of the economic downturn in the united states and the worldwide downturn for the telecommunications industry on economies in canada  europe and other countries and geographic regions 
for  order demand from our customers continued to decline as they experienced the impact of the downturn in the telecommunications market 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses and may not be profitable in the future 
we have experienced substantial net losses  including a net loss of  in and  in and had 
table of contents an accumulated deficit of  as of december  a continued decrease in revenues could have an adverse impact on our finances 
there can be no assurance as to when or if we will achieve profitability 
our prospects for growth depend on recently introduced products  products under development and products licensed from others 
we expect sales of our established products to decline over time 
therefore  our future operating results are highly dependent on market acceptance of our recently introduced products  products that may be introduced in the future and products that we license from others 
these include  for example  the larscom and the orion  and and the orion  all of which have only recently been introduced 
there can be no assurance that such products will achieve widespread market acceptance  and  in fact  some other products we introduced in recent years have failed to meet our sales expectations 
the industry wide downturn has caused sales of new products  such as ours  to be well below expectations 
in addition  we have licensed the intellectual property and development rights for the orion  and our dependence on others for the initial design of this product increases the risk that we may not be successful with future enhancements to the product line 
we have  in the past  experienced delays and changes in course in the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  and such delays and changes in course may occur in the future 
our inability to develop and introduce new products or product versions in a timely manner  due to resource constraints or technological or other reasons  or to achieve timely and widespread market awareness and acceptance of our new products or releases  would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we conducted four rounds of restructuring layoffs in the past nineteen months 
our june  restructuring included a workforce reduction of approximately people and the closure of our north carolina facility 
on october   we announced additional reductions in force of approximately people of the base workforce 
on may  we announced another reduction in force of approximately people of our remaining workforce 
on october   we announced an additional reduction of of our workforce people 
thirty three percent people of the total reductions in employees were from engineering personnel 
although the restructuring actions taken have lowered our expense base  we expect operating losses to continue in therefore  there can be no assurance that another material restructuring and or workforce reduction will not be required 
in addition  our workforce reductions may deprive us of the human capital we would need to take full advantage of any upturn in the business cycle in our industry 
there can be no assurance that we will not lose employees in the future as a result of the restructuring layoffs  or that we will be able to recruit suitable replacements 
rapid technological change could hurt our ability to compete 
the telecommunications equipment industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
the rapid development of new technologies increases the risk that current or new competitors could develop products that would reduce the competitiveness of our products 
our success will depend to a substantial degree upon our ability to respond to changes in technology and customer requirements 
this will require the timely development and marketing of new products and enhancements on a cost effective basis 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing  introducing or managing the transition to new or enhanced products or that any such products will be responsive to technological changes or will gain market acceptance 
in the past  some of the products we have planned and introduced have not met our sales expectations 
our business could be materially and adversely affected by shifts in the use of technology common throughout the industry today 
three shifts affecting our products and industry are the integration of csu dsu technology into routers and switches  a move from t e services to more ethernet based services and the increase in demand for more managed  customer premise based services 
the failure to accommodate these shifts in technology could impact sales of our products and have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results 
the absence of long term backlog makes us vulnerable in periods of weak demand 
none of our customers are contractually obligated to purchase any quantity of products in any particular period  and product sales to major customers have varied widely from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
our current customers might 
table of contents not continue to place orders with us  orders from existing customers might not continue at the levels of previous periods and we might not be able to obtain orders from new customers 
over the last several years  there has been a reduction of equipment demand throughout the telecommunications industry 
because of our limited backlog  this tends to have an immediate negative effect on our operations  which we cannot fully offset on a timely basis by implementing reductions in expenses 
we depend upon a small number of customers 
a small number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of our sales 
therefore  sales for a given quarter generally depend on orders received from  and product shipments to  a limited number of customers 
sales to individual large customers are often related to the customer s specific equipment deployment projects  the timing of which is subject to change on limited notice  in addition to the ebbs and flows in our customers business conditions and the effect of competitors product offerings 
we have in the past experienced both accelerations and slowdowns in orders related to such projects  causing changes in the sales level of a given quarter relative to both the preceding and subsequent quarters 
since most of our sales are in the form of large orders with short delivery times to a limited number of customers  our backlog and consequently our ability to predict revenues will continue to be limited 
in addition  announcements by us or our competitors of new products and technologies could cause customers to defer  limit or end purchases of our existing products 
in the event that we lose one or more large customers  anticipated orders from major customers fail to materialize  or delivery schedules are deferred or canceled as a result of the above  or other unanticipated factors  our business and operating results would be materially adversely affected 
our largest customer  worldcom  filed for bankruptcy in  which could lead to a substantial loss in their customer base or a major reorganization  all of which could influence their order levels to us 
in revenue from sales to worldcom decreased from sales to worldcom in our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
consequently  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
results in any period could also be affected by changes in market demand  competitive market conditions  market acceptance of new or existing products  sales channel development costs  the cost and availability of components  the mix of our customer base and sales channels  the mix of products sold  our sales promotion activities  our ability to expand or contract our sales and marketing organizations effectively  our ability to attract and retain key technical and managerial employees and general economic conditions 
we established our expense levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels and margins  but expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  when sales are below expectations in any given period  our inability to adjust spending proportionally in the short term may exacerbate the adverse impact of a revenue shortfall on our operating results 
because of all of the foregoing factors  our operating results in one or more future periods may be subject to significant fluctuations 
in the event these factors result in financial performance below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the price of our class a common stock could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents we depend heavily on component availability and key suppliers 
on time delivery of our products depends upon the availability of components and subsystems used in our products 
we depend upon our suppliers to manufacture  assemble and deliver components in a timely and satisfactory manner 
we obtain components and license certain embedded software from several single sources 
we do not believe we would be able to develop alternative sources for certain essential components used in our products without incurring significant costs 
in addition  while we believe we would be able to develop alternative sources for most of the other components and software used in our products there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so  in a timely manner without incurring substantial additional costs  if required 
any inability by our suppliers to meet our demand or any prolonged interruption in supply  or a significant increase in the price of one or more components or in the price of software  would likely have an adverse impact on our business and operating results 
we generally do not have any long term contracts with our suppliers and  in fact  we have made a recent decision to change our major supplier for contract manufacturing 
it is possible that our new major contract supplier and other suppliers will not continue to be able and willing to meet our future requirements 
the market for our products is intensely competitive  and our failure to compete effectively could reduce our revenues and margins 
competition in the market place for high speed network access products is intense 
our products compete primarily with quick eagle networks  verilink  kentrox  cisco systems  alcatel  adtran  rad  telco systems  carrier access and paradyne 
we compete to a lesser extent with other telecommunications equipment companies 
many of our competitors have more broadly developed distribution channels and have made greater advances than we have in emerging technologies 
cisco systems and atcatel are two of the largest communications equipment companies in the world 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
we are controlled by axel johnson inc holders of class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of class b common stock are entitled to four votes per share  subject to adjustment to preserve the initial voting ratio 
axel johnson inc is the sole holder of the class b common stock 
as a result  axel johnson inc has sufficient combined voting power to control the direction and policies of larscom absolutely  including mergers  the payment of dividends  consolidations  the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of larscom and the election of the board of directors of larscom  and to prevent or cause a change in control of larscom 
there can be no assurance that axel johnson will not affect our corporate actions in a manner that conflicts with the interest of our other stockholders 
during growth periods  it is difficult to hire all the qualified personnel we need 
to grow our business  we must continue to attract  train  motivate and manage new employees successfully  integrate new management and employees into our overall operations and continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems 
availability of qualified sales and technical personnel is limited  and competition for experienced sales and technical personnel in the telecommunications equipment industry is intense during times when business in the telecommunications equipment industry is strong 
in the past  we have had difficulty in filling all of our hiring requisitions 
our failure to manage the retention of key employees effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we are significantly engaged in selling in international markets  which results in operational difficulties and risks 
sales outside the us approximated of our revenues for the conduct of business outside the us is subject to certain customary risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  currency fluctuations  possible expropriation and potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  to sell our products internationally  we must meet standards established by telecommunications authorities in a variety of countries as well as recommendations of the international telecommunications union 
a delay in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  certification of our products in countries outside the us could inhibit or preclude our marketing and sales efforts in such countries  which could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results 

table of contents we have recently reorganized our sales force 
in october  we reorganized our sales force to concentrate on four account types major accounts  carrier accounts  us indirect channels distributors and resellers and enterprise customers and overseas accounts 
as part of this reorganization we have reassigned certain of our sales people to different  specific customer accounts and different types of customers 
there is a risk that the new relationships with customers resulting from the reorganization might not be as productive as the prior organization in the near term or at all 
failure of the new organization to achieve sales productivity goals could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results 
we have developed an indirect distribution channel for sales to domestic customers 
this channel consists primarily of a small group of master distributors  such as tech data  and a number of authorized resellers 
there are a number of risks associated with an indirect distribution channel 
the risks include a reduction in our ability to forecast sales  reduced average selling prices  potential reductions in customer satisfaction  loss of contact with users of our products  a potential build up of inventories at resellers and new methods of advertising and promoting products that will result in additional expenses 
all of these risk factors could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results 
we must comply with regulations and evolving industry standards 
the market for our products is characterized by the need to comply with a significant number of communications regulations and standards  some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed 
in the us  our products must comply with various regulations defined by the federal communications commission and standards established by underwriters laboratories  as well as industry standards established by various organizations 
as standards for services such as asynchronous transfer mode  frame relay  internet protocol and synchronous optical network synchronous digital hierarchy evolve  we may be required to modify our existing products or develop and support new versions of our products 
the failure of our products to comply  or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving industry standards could delay introduction of or affect the marketability of our products  which in turn could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information 
we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  contractual restrictions  copyrights  trademark laws and patents to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and technologies 
we believe that the success of our business depends primarily on our proprietary technology  information  processes and expertise  rather than patents 
much of our proprietary information and technology is not patented and may not be patentable 
we have been issued only one us patent to date 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees  and into non disclosure agreements with suppliers  distributors and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that these statutory and contractual arrangements will deter misappropriation of our technologies or discourage independent third party development of similar technologies 
in the event such arrangements are insufficient  our business and operating results could be adversely impacted 
we have not conducted a formal patent search relating to the technology used in our products 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us 
since patent applications in the us are not publicly disclosed immediately  applications which we do not know about  may have been filed by competitors of ours that could relate to our products 
the scope of protection accorded to patents covering software related inventions is evolving and is subject to uncertainty  which may increase the risk and cost to us if we discover third party 
table of contents patents related to our software products or if such patents are asserted against us in the future 
in the event of litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in favor of us  could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  we might be required to pay damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  and expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses from third parties 
there can be no assurance that licenses from third parties would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim against us and our failure to develop or license a substitute technology could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results 
we provide our customers a three year or longer warranty on most product lines 
complex products such as ours might contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
although we believe that our reserves for estimated future warranty costs are adequate  our estimates  particularly those related to products that have been recently introduced  might not be correct 
warranty claims in excess of those expected could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results 
as part of the strategy for growth and expansion of our business  we may make acquisitions that could disrupt our business or harm our financial condition 
as part of our business strategy  we may invest in or acquire other businesses  technologies or assets  or enter into strategic relationships with third parties 
for such acquisitions  we may issue additional stock  incur debt  assume liabilities  incur impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets or incur other large and immediate write offs 
with the exception of our acquisition of netedge in  we have no recent experience in integrating acquired businesses with our existing business 
our operation of any acquired business would involve numerous risks including problems integrating any acquired operations with our own  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited experience the potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organization and decrease our cash position 
our class a common stock has traded below one dollar and may be subject to de listing from the nasdaq smallcap market 
on july   we received a notice from nasdaq that our common stock had failed to maintain the required minimum closing bid price of for a period of consecutive trading days as well as the minimum requirements for market value of publicly traded shares on the nasdaq national market 
as a result  nasdaq provided us calendar days  or until october  to regain compliance with this requirement or face de listing from trading on the nasdaq national market 
prior to our de listing  we submitted an application to nasdaq for transfer to their smallcap market 
the application was approved and our stock began trading on the nasdaq smallcap market effective on october  there can be no assurance that our trading price will be at or above nasdaq s smallcap requirements for the necessary time periods mandated by nasdaq 
if we are unable to meet nasdaq s smallcap listing requirements our class a common stock could trade on the otc bulletin board or in the pink sheets maintained by the national quotation bureau  inc such alternatives are generally considered to be less efficient markets  and our stock price  as well as the liquidity of our class a common stock  could be adversely impacted as a result 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio generally has been comprised of commercial paper rated a p  bank certificates of deposit 
table of contents rated a or better and corporate medium term notes and bonds rated a or better 
these securities mature within one year and are classified as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
at december   our investment portfolio included fixed income securities  of the quality described above  with a fair market value of approximately  these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and will decline in value if interest rates rise 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate  hypothetical decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our current year financial condition or results of operations 
because the securities are so short in duration  their principal value would not be materially affected 
the new securities we replace them with when they mature would yield us less interest income  but the amount of the reduction would not be material to us 
if a reduction in interest rates on our investments occurred on january  and remained in effect throughout  our interest income and our cash flow would be reduced by approximately  in we do not hold any long term fixed instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our international sales are typically made in us dollars and are generally not subjected to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
however  certain of our sales and marketing expenses are incurred in local currencies  principally the british pound 
consequently  our international results of operations are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we do not currently hedge against foreign currency rate fluctuations 
gains and losses from such fluctuations have not been material to our consolidated results 
the effect of an immediate  hypothetical change in exchange rate for the british pound or any other foreign currency would not be material to us
