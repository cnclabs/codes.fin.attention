factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the subsection entitled risk factors in item of this form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this form k 
overview pixar was formed in when steve jobs purchased the computer division of lucasfilm and incorporated it as a separate company 
in  we entered into a feature film agreement the feature film agreement with walt disney pictures  a wholly owned subsidiary of the walt disney company together with its subsidiaries and affiliates collectively referred to herein as disney  for the development and production of up to three animated feature films to be marketed and distributed by disney 
our share of revenues and expenses from toy story was governed by the terms of the feature film agreement 
in february  we entered into the co production agreement which superseded the feature film agreement with disney pursuant to which we  on an exclusive basis  agreed to produce five original computer animated feature length theatrical motion pictures the pictures for distribution by disney 
pixar and disney agreed to co finance the production costs of the pictures  co own the pictures with disney having exclusive distribution and exploitation rights  co brand the pictures  and share equally in the profits of each picture and any related merchandise as well as other ancillary products  after recovery of all marketing 
table of contents and distribution costs which disney finances  a distribution fee paid to disney and any other fees or costs  including any participations provided to talent and the like 
the co production agreement generally provides that we will be responsible for the production of each picture  while disney will be responsible for the marketing  promotion  publicity  advertising and distribution of each picture 
our second feature film  a bug s life  was released in november and counts as the first original picture under the co production agreement 
the co production agreement also contemplates that with respect to theatrical sequels  made for home video sequels  television productions  interactive media products and other derivative works related to the pictures  we will have the opportunity to co finance and produce such products or to earn passive royalties on such products 
we will not share in any theme park revenues generated as a result of the pictures 
pursuant to the co production agreement  in addition to co financing the production costs of the pictures  disney will reimburse us for our share of certain general and administrative costs and certain research and development costs that benefit the productions 
in november  toy story  our third animated feature film was released 
as a theatrical sequel  toy story is a derivative work of the original toy story and therefore it does not count toward the five original pictures to be produced under the co production agreement 
as a derivative work  toy story is treated as a picture under the co production agreement  and all the provisions applicable to the five original pictures apply 
in november  we released monsters  inc  our fourth animated feature film  which counts as the second original picture under the co production agreement 
we are currently in various stages of production on three films  finding nemo  the incredibles and cars 
these films will be produced and distributed under the co production agreement and will count as the third  fourth  and fifth films of the pictures to be produced under the co production agreement 
finding nemo is scheduled to be released on may  the incredibles and cars are currently targeted for release no earlier than and  respectively 
all payments to us from disney for development and production of toy story under the feature film agreement  and a bug s life  toy story  monsters  inc  finding nemo  the incredibles and cars under the co production agreement have been recorded as cost reimbursements 
accordingly  no revenue has been recognized for such reimbursements  rather  we have netted the reimbursements against the related costs 
these reimbursed costs through the end of fiscal are set forth in note of notes to financial statements 
the statements regarding the targeted release dates for our future films are forward looking  and the actual release dates may differ 
factors that could cause delays in the release of our films include  but are not limited to the uncertainties related to production delays  financing requirements  personnel availability  external economic and political events  and the release dates of competitive films 
see risk factors in item of this form k 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize film revenue from the distribution of our animated feature films and related products when earned and reasonably estimable in accordance with statement of position accounting by producers or distributors of films sop 
the following are the conditions that must be met in order to recognize revenue in accordance with sop persuasive evidence of a sale or licensing arrangement with a customer exists  the film is complete and  in accordance with the terms of the arrangement  has been delivered or is available for immediate and unconditional delivery  the license period of the arrangement has begun and the customer can begin its exploitation  exhibition or sale  the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured 

table of contents under the co production agreement  we share equally with disney in the profits of monsters  inc  toy story and a bug s life after disney recovers its marketing  distribution and other predefined costs and fees 
our revenues for toy story are governed by the terms of the feature film agreement 
although our revenues are based on the information we receive from disney  we may make adjustments to that information based on our estimates and judgments 
for example  our theatrical revenues may be adjusted for our estimated reserves on potential uncollectible amounts to be received from theatrical exhibitors 
we also make adjustments to our home video revenues for estimates on return reserves that may differ from those reported by disney 
the estimates on reserves may be adjusted periodically based on actual rates of returns  inventory levels in the distribution channel  as well as other business and industry information 
in addition  we utilize margin normalization  such as with merchandising or home video  in accordance with the provisions of sop this may result in the utilization of budgeted or forecasted information rather than actual costs incurred if it is deemed to be a more accurate reflection of our participation 
similar to return reserves  these expense estimates are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically to ensure the most accurate depiction of our participation is reflected 
such adjustments were made to home video reserve and home video and merchandise expense estimates during fiscal these one time adjustments to a bug s life and toy story home video reserves and margins and merchandising revenues had a net impact of to our diluted net income per share for fiscal the amount of revenue recognized in any given quarter or quarters from all of our films depends on the timing  accuracy and sufficiency of the information we receive from disney to determine revenues and associated gross profits 
although disney provides us with the most current information available to enable us to recognize our share of revenue and determine our film gross profit  disney may also make subsequent adjustments to the information that it has provided  and these adjustments could have a material impact on our operating results in later periods 
as additional information becomes available from disney on a more timely basis  it may result in a change of estimation for revenue recognition 
additionally  we have the right to audit disney s books and records related to the pictures per the terms of the co production agreement  which could result in adjustments that may be material to the financial statements in any given quarter or quarters 
any revenue received in advance from disney is deferred and recorded as revenue when earned 
in accordance with the provisions of sop  a film is classified as a library title after three years from the film s initial release 
currently  toy story  a bug s life and toy story are classified as library titles 
the term library titles is used solely for the purpose of classification and for identifying previously released films in accordance with the provisions of sop revenue recognition for such titles is in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policy for film revenue 
film production costs we capitalize our share of direct film production costs in accordance with sop film production costs include costs to develop and produce computer animated motion pictures  which primarily consists of salaries  equipment and overhead 
film production costs in excess of reimbursable amounts from disney are capitalized 
production overhead  a component of film costs  includes allocable costs of individuals or departments with exclusive or significant responsibility for the production of our films 
capitalized production overhead does not include administrative  general and research and development expenses 
in addition to the films produced  we are also working on concept development for several new projects  the costs of which are capitalized as film costs 
in the event a film is not set for production within three years from the time of the first capitalized transaction  all such costs will be expensed 
once a film is released  capitalized film production costs will be amortized in the proportion that the revenue during the period for each film bears to the estimated revenue to be received from all sources under the individual film forecast computation method 
the amount of film costs that will be amortized each quarter will depend on how much future revenue we expect to receive from each film 
we make certain estimates and judgments of our future gross revenues to be received for each film based on information received from disney  and our knowledge of the industry 
estimates of anticipated total gross revenues are reviewed periodically and may be revised if necessary 
a change to the estimate of gross revenues for an individual film may result in an increase or decrease to the percentage of amortization of capitalized film costs 
table of contents relative to a previous period 
unamortized film production costs are compared with net realizable value each reporting period on a film by film basis 
if estimated remaining gross revenues are not sufficient to recover the unamortized film production costs  the unamortized film production costs will be written down to fair value 
results of operations our results for the year ended december  were driven primarily by the worldwide home video release and foreign box office performance of monsters  inc  related merchandise sales and other ancillary royalties for monsters  inc and to a lesser extent  continuing revenues from our library of films 
by the end of fiscal year  monsters  inc had generated approximately million in worldwide box office receipts 
we have also recognized shipments of approximately million home video units  comprised of million vhs units and million dvd units domestically and million vhs units and million dvd units internationally 
we have recognized essentially all worldwide theatrical revenues from monsters  inc and a substantial portion of the worldwide home video revenues as of december  revenue total revenue  which consists of film revenue and software revenue  amounted to million in  million in and million in film revenue was million in  million in  and million in film revenues for were derived primarily from the worldwide theatrical and home video release of toy story along with its associated merchandise revenues and related ancillary royalties  including those associated with the buzz lightyear of star command direct to video release and television series 
also contributing to the film revenue in were continuing home video and merchandise sales from toy story and a bug s life 
film revenues for consisted of revenues from our library titles toy story and a bug s life of million  million from toy story and million from monsters  inc domestic theatrical release 
revenues from our library titles resulted primarily from television licensing  continuing home video and merchandise sales  and ancillary royalties  including revenues resulting from a one time transaction associated with interactive games 
the higher revenues in as compared to were primarily due to the tremendous success of toy story in both theatrical and home video markets 
film revenues for consisted of million from monsters  inc and million in revenues from our library titles toy story  a bug s life and toy story 
revenues for monsters  inc were derived from the worldwide home video sales  foreign box office receipts  merchandise sales and ancillary royalties 
revenues from our library titles resulted primarily from international television licensing  worldwide home video sales  merchandising sales and ancillary royalties 
included within these amounts were revenues of million as a result of one time adjustments to film revenue from a bug s life and toy story home video reserves and margins and merchandising revenues  which had a net impact of to our diluted net income per share 
the higher revenues in relative to both and were primarily due to the tremendous success of monsters  inc in both foreign theatrical and worldwide home video markets 
in may  two of our library titles  toy story and a bug s life  will go on a moratorium 
software revenue includes software license revenue  principally from renderman  and royalty revenue from licensing physical effects  inc pei technology to a third party 
software revenue was million in  million in and million in pei  a company we acquired in  licensed certain of its technology to a third party  from which we now receive associated royalty revenue on a quarterly basis 
in spite of the increase in software revenue for  our primary focus is on content creation for animated feature films and related products  and as a result  we have not increased the time and resources necessary to generate significantly higher renderman license revenues 
therefore  we continue to expect ongoing variability in revenue derived from software licenses from year to year 
software maintenance contracts are recorded as unearned revenue and recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance agreement  which ranges from to months in duration 
for fiscal years  and  disney accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenue 

table of contents cost of revenue cost of film revenue was million in  million in and million in and represents primarily amortization of capitalized film costs 
cost of film revenue as a percentage of film revenue for fiscal years  and was  and  respectively 
our cost of film revenue as a percentage of film revenue may vary for any given period due to changes in the mix of film revenue as the gross profit varies by film  as well as for revisions to estimates on revenue to be received under the individual film forecast method 
a change to an individual film s estimate of revenue to be received may result in an increase or decrease to the amortization of the capitalized film costs relative to a previous period 
toy story revenue has no related cost  as film costs were fully amortized by december  for  the cost of revenue percentage was driven primarily from the amortization of capitalized film costs for toy story  which had a higher amortization percent than the other films at that time 
the decline in cost of film revenue as a percentage of total film revenue from to can be attributed to a higher proportion of revenues resulting from toy story and a bug s life  which had lower percentages of cost amortization than toy story the increase in cost of film revenue as a percentage of total film revenue from to can be attributed to a much higher proportion of revenues resulting from monsters  inc  which had a higher percentage of cost amortization than our library titles 
cost of software revenue consists of the direct cost and manufacturing overhead required to reproduce and to package our software products  as well as amortization of purchased technology 
cost of software revenue includes no amortization of internal software development expenses since no such expenses have been capitalized 
cost of software revenue as a percentage of the related revenue increased from in to in and then decreased to in cost of software revenue in all three years was due primarily to the amortization of purchased technology associated with the acquisition of pei 
approximately million of the pei purchase price was assigned to purchased technology  which pei licensed to a third party 
amortization of this purchased technology was completed in operating expenses total operating expenses increased from million in  to million in and to million in we anticipate an increase in operating expenses in future periods due to the growth experienced by the studio as we increase resources dedicated to production of our three current film projects remaining in the co production agreement and to our own productions 
under the co production agreement  disney reimburses us for half of certain general and administrative costs and certain research and development costs that benefit the productions 
the funding received from disney is treated as operating expense reimbursements 
see note of notes to financial statements 
to the extent that personnel  facilities and other expenditures are neither capitalized by us nor allocated to and paid for by disney  and precede or are not subsequently followed by an increase in revenue  our business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
for example  in february we approved project for production and because it is our first feature film to be produced outside of the existing relationship with disney  certain costs that were previously reimbursed by disney will now be expensed as incurred 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and support for personnel conducting research and development for the renderman product  for our proprietary marionette tm and ringmaster tm animation and production management software and for creative development for future films 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in research and development expenses in incorporated a one time   reimbursement from disney under the co production agreement for certain research and development expenses incurred prior to for short film projects 
after allowing for the one time reimbursement  the slight increase in research and development expenses for was primarily attributable to increases in employee related expenses associated with additional staffing for research and development  offset by a reduction in short film project and creative development costs 
research and development in increased from as a result of increases in employee related expenses associated with additional staffing for research and development and an increase in short film project costs and creative development costs 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in future periods as we increase our investments in our 
table of contents proprietary technology 
to date  all research and development costs not reimbursed by disney have been expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead  as well as public relations  advertising  technical support and trade show costs required to support our software segment 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase in expenses during was primarily due to additional expenses associated with the corporate marketing and creative resources departments related to the release of our fourth film  monsters  inc the decrease in expenses during can be attributed to greater reimbursements received from disney for marketing costs related to monsters  inc and our other upcoming feature film projects 
we believe that sales and marketing expenses will increase in future periods  particularly in the areas of public relations and corporate marketing 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of management and administrative personnel  insurance costs and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses have increased from million in to million in and to million in the increase in general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to increases in employee related costs and insurance  which were offset by reductions in public company costs 
the increase from to was primarily due to increases in employee related costs and professional fees and certain one time settlements paid in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods 
other income other income was million in  million in and million in other income consists primarily of interest income from investments 
the increase from to is primarily due to a one time  non recurring settlement of approximately million  unrelated to our core business in the decrease from to is due to the one time  non recurring settlement in also contributing to the decrease were declining interest rates during income taxes income tax expense of million  million and million reflects our effective tax rates of  and for  and  respectively 
our income tax rate was lower in due to the utilization of research and experimentation credits for federal and state tax purposes  as well as the utilization of certain other state credits and exemptions 
in  our income tax rate approximated us federal and california state statutory rates 
our effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods

the pro forma amounts assume that we had been following the fair value based method since the beginning of liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investments increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase was primarily due to cash received from disney for our share of film revenue  as well as proceeds from stock option exercises  software revenue  and interest income

table of contents as of december   our principal source of liquidity was approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
our future capital commitments primarily consist of obligations to fund production costs of films and derivative products under the co production agreement and beyond 
pursuant to the co production agreement  we will co finance the next three original animated feature films we have in production  finding nemo  the incredibles and cars 
in the future  we may co finance other derivative works such as theatrical sequels  direct to home video sequels  interactive products and television productions 
additionally  we have already approved for production our first film beyond the co production agreement and will finance those costs entirely 
we also have obligations to pay portions of any revenue derived from each feature film produced under the co production agreement to our entertainment law firm in consideration for services rendered 
film production costs 
in fiscal  we expect to spend approximately million to million  net of disney s film cost reimbursements  on direct film costs and other costs to fund our ongoing film projects under the co production agreement and beyond  which will directly impact working capital 
facility related capital expenditures 
in fiscal  we expect to spend approximately million to million related to capital expenditures for our emeryville headquarters and studio and other facility related projects 
we believe that our current available funds and forecasted cash from operations in will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures  including the production costs of finding nemo  the incredibles and cars  as well as the production and development costs associated with films not covered under the co production agreement 
there can be no assurance that current and forecasted cash from operations will be sufficient to fund operations 
to date  we have chosen to use our existing cash resources to fund both the construction on our emeryville facility and film production costs 
we may continue to use our cash resources for such expenditures  or may choose to finance such capital expenditures through issuance of additional equity or debt securities  by obtaining a credit facility or by some other financing mechanism

the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment portfolio 
we invest in a variety of investment grade  fixed income securities  including obligations of corporations and national governmental entities and their agencies 
this diversification of risk is consistent with our policy to ensure safety of our principal and maintain liquidity 
we only invest in securities 
table of contents with a maturity of months or less  with only government obligations exceeding months 
our investments are primarily fixed rate obligations and carry a certain degree of interest rate risk 
a rise in interest rates could adversely impact the fair market value of these securities 
all of our financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading and are considered available for sale according to sfas no 
the table below provides information regarding our investment portfolio at december  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average fixed interest rates presented by expected maturity date dollars in thousands less than over year year total available for sale securities weighted average interest rate impact of foreign currency rate changes 
while disney and its affiliates distribute our products in foreign markets  we are not directly exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
we recognize revenues from foreign territories based on an average foreign currency exchange rate used by disney for revenue reporting 
this rate may differ from the actual exchange rate at the time cash is remitted to disney and subsequently to us 
therefore  there may be some indirect foreign currency exchange rate exposure as managed by disney
