item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts in millions  except for per share data  unless otherwise stated management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a addresses the financial condition of the hartford financial services group  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  the hartford or the company as of december   compared with december   and its results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f certain of the statements contained herein other than statements of historical fact are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and include estimates and assumptions related to economic  competitive and legislative developments 
these forward looking statements are subject to change and uncertainty which are  in many instances  beyond the company s control and have been made based upon management s expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect upon the company 
there can be no assurance that future developments will be in accordance with management s expectations or that the effect of future developments on the hartford will be those anticipated by management 
actual results could differ materially from those expected by the company  depending on the outcome of various factors 
these factors include the difficulty in predicting the company s potential exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation  in particular  significant uncertainty with regard to the outcome of the company s current dispute with mac arthur company and its subsidiary  western macarthur company collectively or individually  macarthur  the uncertain nature of damage theories and loss amounts and the development of additional facts related to the september terrorist attack september  the uncertain impact on the company of the bush administration s budget proposals relating to the distribution of nontaxable dividends to shareholders and the creation of new tax favored individual savings accounts  the response of reinsurance companies under reinsurance contracts  the impact of increasing reinsurance rates  and the availability and adequacy of reinsurance to protect the company against losses  the possibility of more unfavorable loss experience than anticipated  the possibility of general economic and business conditions that are less favorable than anticipated  the incidence and severity of catastrophes  both natural and man made  the effect of changes in interest rates  the stock markets or other financial markets  stronger than anticipated competitive activity  unfavorable legislative  regulatory or judicial developments  the company s ability to distribute its products through distribution channels  both current and future  the uncertain effects of emerging claim and coverage issues  the effect of assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds and second injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements  a downgrade in the company s claims paying  financial strength or credit ratings  the ability of the company s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the company  and other factors described in such forward looking statements

actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company has identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability reserves  valuation of investments and derivative instruments  deferred policy acquisition costs  pension and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies 
in developing these estimates management makes subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop 
although variability is inherent in these estimates  management believes the amounts provided are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements 
reserves life life insurance subsidiaries of the hartford establish and carry as liabilities actuarially determined reserves  which are calculated to meet the hartford s future obligations 
reserves for life insurance and disability contracts are based on actuarially recognized methods using prescribed morbidity and mortality tables in general use in the united states  which are modified to reflect the hartford s actual experience when appropriate 
these reserves are computed at amounts that  with additions from estimated premiums to be received and with interest on such reserves compounded annually at certain assumed rates  are expected to be sufficient to meet the hartford s policy obligations at their maturities or in the event of an insured s death 
changes in or deviations from the assumptions used for mortality  morbidity  expected future premiums and interest can significantly affect the life reserve levels and related future operations 
reserves also include unearned premiums  premium deposits  claims incurred but not reported ibnr and claims reported but not yet paid 
reserves for assumed reinsurance are computed in a manner that is comparable to direct insurance reserves 
the liability for policy benefits for universal life type contracts and interest sensitive whole life policies is equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of policyholders  including credited interest  amounts that have been assessed to compensate the company for services to be performed over future periods and any amounts previously assessed against policyholders that are refundable on termination of the contract 
for investment contracts  policyholder liabilities are equal to the accumulated policy account values  which consist of an accumulation of deposit payments plus credited interest  less withdrawals and amounts assessed through the end of the period 
certain investment contracts include provisions whereby a guaranteed minimum death benefit is provided in the event that the contractholder s account value at death is below the guaranteed value 
although the company reinsures the majority of the death benefit guarantees associated with its in force block of business  declines in the equity market may increase the company s net exposure to death benefits under these contracts 
in addition  these contracts contain various provisions for determining the amount of the death benefit guaranteed following the withdrawal of a portion of the account value by the policyholder 
partial withdrawals under certain of these contracts may not result in a reduction in the guaranteed minimum death benefit in proportion to the portion surrendered 
the company records the death benefit costs  net of reinsurance  when deaths occur 
for the company s group disability policies  the level of reserves is based on a variety of factors including particular diagnoses  termination rates and benefit levels 
property casualty the hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims made under policies written by the company 
these reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported  and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims and claim adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process 
this estimation process is based largely on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience  trends and other relevant factors 
reserve estimates can change over time because of unexpected changes in the external environment 
potential external factors include changes in the inflation rate for goods and services related to covered damages such as medical care  hospital care  auto parts  wages and home repair  changes in the general economic environment that could cause unanticipated changes in the claim frequency per unit insured  changes in the litigious environment as evidenced by changes in claimant attorney representation in the claims negotiation and settlement process  changes in the judicial environment regarding the interpretation of policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage and or the amount of damages awarded for certain types of damages  changes in the social environment regarding the general attitude of juries in the determination of liability and damages  changes in the regulatory environment regarding rates  rating plans and policy forms  changes in the legislative environment regarding the definition of damages and new types of injuries caused by new types of exposure to injury past examples include breast implants  tobacco products  lead paint  construction defect and blood product contamination 
reserve estimates can also change over time because of changes in internal company operations 
potential internal factors include periodic changes in claims handling procedures  growth in new lines of business where exposure and loss development patterns are not well established or changes in the quality of risk selection in the underwriting process 
in the case of reinsurance  all of the above risks apply 
in addition  changes in ceding company case reserving and reporting patterns create additional factors that need to be considered in estimating the reserves 
due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used  final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates  particularly when those settlements may not occur until well into the future 
the hartford  like other insurance companies  categorizes and tracks its insurance reserves by line of business  such as general liability  commercial multi peril  workers compensation  auto bodily injury  homeowners and assumed reinsurance 
furthermore  the hartford regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve levels at the line of business level  taking into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims for the subsets of claims in each particular line of business 
adjustments to previously established reserves  if any  are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary 
in the judgment of management  all information currently available has been properly considered in the reserves established for claims and claim adjustment expenses 
in the opinion of management  based upon the known facts and current law  the reserves recorded for the hartford s property and casualty businesses at december  represent the company s best estimate of its ultimate liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses related to losses covered by policies written by the company 
however  because of the significant uncertainties surrounding environmental and particularly asbestos exposures  it is possible that management s estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change and that the required adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves by an amount that could be material to the hartford s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
asbestos and environmental claims the hartford continues to receive claims that assert damages from asbestos and environmental related exposures 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up costs 
the hartford wrote several different categories of insurance coverage to which asbestos and environmental claims may apply 
first  the hartford wrote direct policies as a primary liability insurance carrier 
second  the hartford wrote direct excess insurance policies providing additional coverage for insureds that exhaust their primary liability insurance coverage 
third  the hartford acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of risks previously assumed by other insurers writing primary  excess and reinsurance coverages 
fourth  the hartford participated as a london market company that wrote both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business 
in establishing asbestos reserves  the hartford evaluates the exposure presented by each insured and the anticipated cost of resolution  if any  for each insured 
in the course of this evaluation  the hartford considers available insurance coverage  including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the hartford has issued to the insured  limits and deductibles  an analysis of each insured s potential liability  the jurisdictions involved  past and anticipated future claim activity  past settlement values of similar claims  allocated claim adjustment expense  potential role of other insurance  the role  if any  of non asbestos claims or potential non asbestos claims in any resolution process  and applicable coverage defenses or determinations  if any  including whether some or all of the asbestos claims for which the insured seeks coverage are products or completed operations claims subject to the aggregate limit 
in establishing environmental reserves  the hartford evaluates the exposure presented by each insured and the anticipated cost of resolution  if any  for each insured 
in the course of this analysis  the hartford considers the probable liability  available coverage  relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of similar exposures 
in addition  the hartford considers numerous facts that are unique to each insured  to the extent known  such as the nature of the alleged activities of the insured at each site  the allegations of environmental harm at each site  the number of sites  the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site  the nature of environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site  the nature of government enforcement activities at each site  the ownership and general use of each site  the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the hartford and the insured  including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the hartford has issued to the insured  the involvement of other insurers  the potential for other available coverage  including the number of years of coverage  the role  if any  of non environmental claims or potential non environmental claims in any resolution process  and the applicable law in each jurisdiction 
for both asbestos and environmental reserves  the hartford also compares its historical direct net loss and expense paid and incurred experience  and net loss and expense paid and incurred experience year by year  to assess any emerging trends  fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and incurred activity 
once the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and allocated claim adjustment expense is determined for each insured by each policy year  the hartford calculates its ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance and the company s experience with reinsurance collections 
uncertainties regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves with regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims  significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related settlement expenses 
conventional reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of these claims  particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux 
as a result of the factors discussed in the following paragraphs  the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures 
in particular  the hartford believes there is a high degree of uncertainty inherent in the estimation of asbestos loss reserves 
in the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures  factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include inadequate development patterns  plaintiffs expanding theories of liability  the risks inherent in major litigation and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines 
courts have reached inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage  what types of losses are covered  whether there is an insurer obligation to defend  how policy limits are determined  whether particular claims are product completed operation claims subject to an aggregate limit and how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted 
furthermore  insurers in general  including the hartford  have recently experienced an increase in the number of asbestos related claims due to  among other things  more intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants  plaintiffs increased focus on new and previously peripheral defendants and an increase in the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities 
plaintiffs and insureds have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers 
in addition  some policyholders have begun to assert new classes of claims for so called non product coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not apply 
recently  many insurers  including  in a limited number of instances  the hartford  also have been sued directly by asbestos claimants asserting that insurers had a duty to protect the public from the dangers of asbestos 
management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
in the case of the reserves for environmental exposures  factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include court decisions that have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than originally intended  inconsistent decisions  especially across jurisdictions and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured 
further uncertainties include the effect of the recent acceleration in the rate of bankruptcy filings by asbestos defendants on the rate and amount of the hartford s asbestos claims payments  a further increase or decrease in asbestos and environmental claims which cannot now be anticipated  whether some policyholders liabilities will reach the umbrella or excess layer of their coverage  the resolution or adjudication of some disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos claims in a manner inconsistent with the hartford s previous assessment of these claims  the number and outcome of direct actions against the hartford  and unanticipated developments pertaining to the hartford s ability to recover reinsurance for environmental and asbestos claims 
it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims 
additionally  the reporting pattern for excess insurance and reinsurance claims is much longer than direct claims 
in many instances  it takes months or years to determine that the customer s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in question may apply to such claims 
the delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves 
given the factors and emerging trends described above  the hartford believes the actuarial tools and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for its asbestos exposures 
the hartford continually evaluates new information and new methodologies in assessing its potential asbestos exposures 
at any time  the hartford may be conducting an analysis of newly identified information and completion of exposure analyses could cause the hartford to change its estimates of its asbestos reserves and the effect of these changes could be material to the company s consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
valuation of investments and derivative instruments the hartford s investments in both fixed maturities  which include bonds  redeemable preferred stock and commercial paper  and equity securities  which include common and non redeemable preferred stocks  are classified as available for sale as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
accordingly  these securities are carried at fair value with the after tax difference from amortized cost  as adjusted for the effect of deducting the life and pension policyholders share of the immediate participation guaranteed contracts and the change in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  reflected in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
policy loans are carried at outstanding balance  which approximates fair value 
other invested assets consist primarily of limited partnership investments that are accounted for by the equity method 
the company s net income from partnerships is included in net investment income 
other investments also include mortgage loans at amortized cost and derivatives at fair value 
the fair value of securities is based upon quoted market prices or broker quotations when available 
where market prices or broker quotations are not available  management typically estimates the fair value based upon discounted cash flow  applying current interest rates for similar financial instruments with comparable terms and credit quality 
the estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ significantly from the amount that could be realized if the security were sold immediately 
derivative instruments are reported at fair value based upon internally established valuations that are consistent with external valuation models  quotations furnished by dealers in such instrument or market quotations 
one of the significant estimations inherent in the valuation of investments is the evaluation of other than temporary impairments 
the evaluation for other than temporary impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process which is subject to risks and uncertainties in the determination of whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary 
the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions  the issuer s financial condition or near term recovery prospects and the effects of changes in interest rates 
the company s accounting policy requires that a decline in the value of a security below its amortized cost basis be assessed to determine if the decline is other than temporary 
if so  the security is deemed to be impaired and  a charge is recorded in net realized capital losses equal to the difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security 
the fair value of the impaired investment becomes its new cost basis 
the company has a security monitoring process overseen by a committee of investment and accounting professionals that identifies securities that  due to certain characteristics  are subjected to an enhanced analysis on a quarterly basis 
such characteristics include  but are not limited to a deterioration of the financial condition of the issuer  the magnitude and duration of unrealized losses  credit rating and industry category 
the primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value for corporate issued securities is other than temporary include a the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  b the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  c whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments and d the intent and ability of the company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery 
additionally  for certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows including asset backed securities  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  requires the company to periodically update its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security 
if management estimates that the fair value of its securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate  considering both timing and amount  then an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized 
projections of expected future cash flows may change based upon new information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral 
furthermore  for securities expected to be sold  an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized if the company does not expect the fair value of a security to recover to amortized cost prior to the expected date of sale 
once an impairment charge has been recorded  the company then continues to review the other than temporarily impaired securities for appropriate valuation on an ongoing basis 
deferred policy acquisition costs life policy acquisition costs  which include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and are primarily associated with acquiring business  are deferred and amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts  usually years 
the deferred costs are recorded as an asset commonly referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs dac 
at december  and  the carrying value of the company s life operations dac was billion and billion  respectively 
dac related to traditional policies are amortized over the premium paying period in proportion to the present value of annual expected premium income 
adjustments are made each year to recognize actual experience as compared to assumed experience for the current period 
dac related to investment contracts and universal life type contracts are deferred and amortized using the retrospective deposit method 
under the retrospective deposit method  acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to the present value of estimated gross profits egps from projected investment  mortality and expense margins and surrender charges 
a portion of the dac amortization is allocated to realized gains and losses 
the dac balance is also adjusted by an amount that represents the change in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs that would have been required as a charge or credit to operations had unrealized amounts been realized 
actual gross profits can vary from management s estimates  resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization 
the company regularly evaluates its estimated gross profits to determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
several assumptions considered to be significant in the development of egps include separate account fund performance  surrender and lapse rates  estimated interest spread and estimated mortality 
the separate account fund performance assumption is critical to the development of the egps related to the company s variable annuity and variable and interest sensitive life insurance businesses 
the average long term rate of assumed separate account fund performance used in estimating gross profits for the variable annuity and variable life business was at december  and for all other products including fixed annuities and other universal life type contracts the average assumed investment yield ranged from to for the years ended december  and due to the increased volatility and precipitous decline experienced by the us equity markets in  the company enhanced its dac evaluation process during the course of the year 
the company developed sophisticated modeling capabilities  which allowed it to run stochastically determined scenarios of separate account fund performance 
these scenarios were then utilized to calculate a reasonable range of estimates for the present value of future gross profits 
this range is then compared to the present value of future gross profits currently utilized in the dac amortization model 
as of december   the current estimate falls within the reasonable range  and therefore  the company does not believe there is evidence to suggest a revision to the egps is necessary 
additionally  the company has performed various sensitivity analyses with respect to separate account fund performance to provide an indication of future separate account fund performance levels  which could result in the need to revise future egps 
the company has estimated that a revision to the future egps is unlikely in in the event that the separate account fund performance meets or exceeds the company s long term assumption of and that a revision is likely if the overall separate account fund performance is negative for the year 
in the event that separate account fund performance falls between and during  the company will need to evaluate the actual gross profits versus the mean egps generated by the stochastic dac analysis and determine whether or not to make a revision to the future egps 
factors that will influence this determination include the degree of volatility in separate account fund performance  when during the year performance becomes negative and shifts in asset allocation within the separate account made by policyholders 
the overall return generated by the separate account is dependent on several factors  including the relative mix of the underlying sub accounts among bond funds and equity funds as well as equity sector weightings 
the company s overall separate account fund performance has been reasonably correlated to the overall performance of the s p index  although no assurance can be provided that this correlation will continue in the future 
should the company change its assumptions utilized to develop egps commonly referred to as unlocking the company would record a charge or credit to bring its dac balance to the level it would have been had egps been calculated using the new assumptions from the date of each policy 
the company evaluates all critical assumptions utilized to develop egps eg lapse  mortality and will make a revision to future egps to the extent that actual experience is significantly different than expected 
the overall recoverability of the dac asset is dependent on the future profitability of the business 
the company tests the aggregate recoverability of the dac asset by comparing the amounts deferred to total egps 
in addition  the company routinely stress tests its dac asset for recoverability against severe declines in its separate account assets  which could occur if the equity markets experienced another significant sell off  as the majority of policyholders money held in the separate accounts are invested in the equity market 
as of december   separate account assets could fall and the company believes its dac asset would still be recoverable 
property casualty the property casualty operations also incur costs  including commissions  premium taxes and certain underwriting and policy issuance costs  that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of property casualty insurance business and are deferred and amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned 
deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income  and if not  are charged to expense 
anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs 
for the years ended december   and  no material amounts of deferred acquisition costs were charged to expense based on the determination of recoverability 
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations pursuant to accounting principles related to the company s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations to employees under its various benefit plans  the company is required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the related liabilities and expense each period 
the two economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension expense are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return 
in determining the discount rate assumption  the company utilizes information provided by its plan actuaries 
in particular  the company uses an interest rate yield curve developed and published by its plan actuaries 
the yield curve is comprised of aaa aa bonds with maturities between zero and thirty years 
discounting the cash flows of the company s pension plan using this yield curve  it was determined that is the appropriate discount rate as of december  to calculate the company s accrued benefit cost liability 
accordingly  the discount rate will also be used to determine the company s pension expense 
the company determines the long term rate of return assumption for the pension plan s asset portfolio based on analysis of the portfolio s historical rates of return balanced with future long term return expectations 
based on its long term outlook with respect to the markets  which has been influenced by the poor equity market performance in recent years as well as the recent decline in fixed income security yields  the company lowered its long term rate of return assumption from to as of december  to illustrate the impact of these assumptions on annual pension expense for and going forward  a basis point change in the discount rate will increase decrease pension expense by approximately  and a basis point change in the long term asset return assumption will increase decrease pension expense by approximately contingencies management follows the requirements of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
this statement requires management to evaluate each contingent matter separately 
the evaluation is a two step process  including determining a likelihood of loss  and  if a loss is probable  developing a potential range of loss 
management establishes reserves for these contingencies at its best estimate  or  if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other  the company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses 
the majority of contingencies currently being evaluated by the company relate to litigation and tax matters  which are inherently difficult to evaluate and subject to significant changes

operating income is a performance measure used by the company in the management of its operations 
management believes that this performance measure delineates the results of operations of the company s ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in the company s current business 
however  operating income should only be analyzed in conjunction with  and not in lieu of  net income and may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the company s competitors 
operating results compared to revenues increased  or 
this increase was driven by strong earned premium growth within business insurance  personal lines and specialty commercial whose premiums increased by  and  respectively 
also contributing to the growth was a increase in fee income for the individual life segment 
additionally  revenues included a reduction of in property casualty earned premiums  resulting from additional reinsurance cessions related to september partially offsetting the increases described above were higher net realized capital losses  which were in compared with in the increase in the net realized capital losses was due primarily to other than temporary write downs of corporate and asset backed securities including those in the telecommunication  utility and airline industries

 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation expense is determined on the measurement date  that is the first date on which both the number of shares the employee is entitled to receive and the exercise price are known 
compensation expense  if any  is measured based on the award s intrinsic value  which is the excess of the market price of the stock over the exercise price on the measurement date

the revenue growth in the individual life segment was primarily due to higher earned fee income and net investment income resulting from the business acquired from fortis 
the group benefits segment experienced higher earned premiums due to strong sales and persistency 
the investment products segment also contributed to the revenue increase as a result of higher fee income in the retail mutual fund business and higher net investment income in the institutional business

in addition  in the hartford mutual funds  inc reached billion in assets faster than any other retail oriented mutual fund family in history  according to strategic insight 
compared to revenues in the investment products segment increased  or 
these increases in revenues are primarily driven by growth in the institutional investment product business  where related assets under management increased  or  to billion as of december  this revenue increase was partially offset by lower fee income related to the individual annuity operation as average account values decreased from billion to billion compared to prior year  primarily due to the lower equity markets 
expenses increased  or  driven by increases of  or  in interest credited on general account assets   or  in commissions and wholesaling expenses  and in individual annuity death benefit costs due to the lower equity markets  and an increase of  or  in operating expenses incurred by other investment products  primarily driven by the mutual fund business

net investment income from other investment products increased  or  due mostly to growth in the institutional business  where account values were billion at december   an increase of billion  or  from a year ago 
the increase in revenues from other investment products was partially offset by individual annuity revenues  which decreased  or

excluding fortis  individual annuity s operating expenses decreased  or  from prior year  driven by management s continued focus on maintaining operating expense levels 
partially offsetting the increase in benefits  claims and insurance operating costs was a decrease in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs resulting from the lower gross profits associated with the individual annuity business

outlook management believes the market for retirement products continues to expand as individuals increasingly save and plan for retirement 
demographic trends suggest that as the baby boom generation matures  a significant portion of the united states population will allocate a greater percentage of their disposable incomes to saving for their retirement years due to uncertainty surrounding the social security system and increases in average life expectancy 
as this market grows  particularly for variable annuities and mutual funds  new companies are continually entering the market  aggressively seeking distribution channels and pursuing market share 
one factor which could impact the investment products segment is the president s budget proposal 
see capital resources and liquidity section under legislative initiatives for further discussion of this proposed legislation 
the individual annuity segment continues to be impacted by the lower equity markets in terms of lower assets under management 
however  the company experienced strong sales of annuities which were billion in as compared to billion in partially contributing to the growth in sales is the hartford s introduction of principal first  a guaranteed withdrawal benefit rider  which was developed in response to the customers needs 
based on vards  the company had market share as of december  as compared to at december  for discussion of the potential future financial statement impact of continued declines in the equity market on the investment products segment  see the capital markets risk management section under equity risk 
management believes that it has developed and implemented strategies to maintain and enhance its position as a market leader in the financial services industry 
for example  the hartford introduced a tax advantaged college savings product plan in early called smart smart is a state sponsored education savings program established by the state of west virginia which offers an easy way for both the residents of west virginia and out of state participants to invest for a college education 
the smart product complements hli s existing offering of investment products mutual funds  variable annuities  k  and b plans 
it also leverages the company s capabilities in distribution  service and fund performance 
in its first year the smart product has been well received by many americans saving for college

outlook individual life sales continue to be impacted by the lower equity markets  uncertainty surrounding estate tax legislation and aggressive competition from universal life providers

the company also offers disability underwriting  administration  claims processing services and reinsurance to other insurers and self funded employer plans 
compared to revenues in the group benefits segment increased  or  and excluding buyouts  increased  or  driven primarily by growth in premiums  which increased  or 
the growth in premiums was due to an increase of  or  in fully insured ongoing premiums  as a result of steady persistency and pricing actions on the in force block of business and strong sales to new customers 
offsetting this increase was a decrease in military medicare supplement premiums of resulting from federal legislation effective in the fourth quarter of this legislation provides retired military officers age and older with full medical insurance paid for by the government  eliminating the need for medicare supplement insurance 
additionally  premium revenues for were offset by an decrease in total buyouts

outlook employees continue to look to the workplace for a broader and ever expanding array of insurance products 
as employers design benefit strategies to attract and retain employees while attempting to control their benefit costs  management believes that the need the group benefits segment s products will continue to expand 
this  combined with the significant number of employees who currently do not have coverage or adequate levels of coverage  creates unique opportunities for the group benefits segment s products and services 
current market conditions  including low interest rates  rising medical costs and cost containment pressure on employers  create a challenging business environment 
however  the company s strength in claim and risk management  service and distribution will enable the group benefits segment to continue to capitalize on market opportunities despite the challenging business environment

in january  property casualty integrated its affinity personal lines and personal insurance segments  now reported as personal lines 
as a result  property casualty is now organized into five reportable operating segments the north american underwriting segments of business insurance  personal lines  specialty commercial and reinsurance  and the other operations segment  which includes substantially all of the company s asbestos and environmental exposures 
also reported within property casualty is north american  which includes the combined underwriting results of the north american underwriting segments along with income and expense items not directly allocated to these segments  such as net investment income  net realized capital gains and losses  other expenses including interest and income taxes 
ratios the previous table and the following segment discussions for the years ended december   and include various operating ratios 
management believes that these ratios are useful in understanding the underlying trends in the hartford s current business 
however  these measures should only be used in conjunction with  and not in lieu of  underwriting income and may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the company s competitors 
the loss ratio is the ratio of claims expense exclusive of claim adjustment expenses to earned premiums 
the loss adjustment expense ratio represents the ratio of claim adjustment expenses to earned premiums 
the expense ratio is the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses commissions  taxes  licenses and fees  as well as other underwriting expenses to written premiums 
the policyholder dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premiums 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio  the loss adjustment expense ratio  the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio 
these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every of net premiums earned or written  the cost of losses and statutory expenses  respectively 
the combined ratio presents the total cost per of premium production 
a combined ratio below demonstrates underwriting profit  a combined ratio above demonstrates underwriting losses 
gaap combined ratios differ from statutory combined ratios primarily due to the deferral and amortization of certain expenses for gaap reporting purposes and the use of earned premium in the expense ratio rather than written premium 
the following is a summary of property casualty operating income  after tax 
operating income represents after tax operating results excluding  as applicable  net realized capital gains or losses  losses from early retirement of debt  the cumulative effect of accounting changes and restructuring charges 
operating income is a performance measure used by the hartford in the management of its operations

a reconciliation of net income loss to operating income loss is provided in the preceding table

net investment income and net realized capital gains and losses are discussed in the investments section 
for a further discussion of september  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
compared to operating income  excluding the after tax impact of september  increased  or  primarily due to improved underwriting results across each of the north american underwriting segments  particularly in specialty commercial and reinsurance 
partially offsetting the improvement was an increase in other expenses primarily as a result of an increase in e business research and development expenses and certain employee benefits costs  as well as expenses incurred related to the transfer of the company s new jersey personal lines agency auto business to palisades safety and insurance association and palisades insurance co 
compared to operating income  excluding the after tax impact of september  decreased  or 
earned premium growth in business insurance due to price increases  strong new business growth and improved premium renewal retention  as well as an increase in north american investment income  was offset by increased losses in the personal automobile lines of business and in reinsurance 
a decrease in underwriting results of  after tax  related to enron corporation and lower income resulting from the sales of international subsidiaries also contributed to the decrease 
reserves as discussed in notes l  and b of notes to consolidated financial statements and in the critical accounting estimates section  reserving for property and casualty losses is an estimation process 
as additional experience and other relevant claim data become available  reserve levels are adjusted accordingly 
such adjustments of reserves related to claims incurred in prior years are a natural occurrence in the loss reserving process and are referred to as reserve development 
reserve development that increases previous estimates of ultimate cost is called reserve strengthening 
reserve development that decreases previous estimates of ultimate cost is called reserve releases 
reserve development can influence the comparability of year over year underwriting results and are set forth in the paragraphs and tables that follow 
reserve strengthening in the business insurance segment for the year ended december  was not significant 
in personal lines  prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses for non standard auto were strengthened due to heavier than expected frequency  severity and litigation rates on prior accident years 
in addition  the prior accident year provision was increased modestly for mold losses 
virtually all of the strengthening in specialty commercial is due to deductible workers compensation losses on a few large accounts 
reserve strengthening in the reinsurance segment occurred across multiple accident years  primarily through  and across several lines of business 
high reported losses from ceding companies have persisted throughout and loss ratios have been revised upward 
virtually all of the reserve strengthening in the other operations segment related to asbestos 
there was little reserve strengthening or weakening by segment in with the exception of other operations  where the strengthening was related almost entirely to non asbestos and environmental exposures

each of these companies is primarily focused on managing claims  resolving disputes and collecting reinsurance proceeds  related largely to business underwritten and reinsured in and prior years 
while the business that was written in these units on either a direct or reinsurance basis spanned a wide variety of insurance and reinsurance policies and coverages  a significant and increasing proportion of current and future claims activity arising from these businesses relates to environmental and  to a greater extent  asbestos exposures

compared to revenues were down  or  and operating income was down  or  primarily due to the sale of zwolsche 
asbestos and environmental claims the hartford continues to receive asbestos and environmental claims  both of which affect other operations 
these claims are made pursuant to several different categories of insurance coverage 
first  the hartford wrote direct policies as a primary liability insurance carrier 
second  the hartford wrote direct excess insurance policies providing additional coverage for insureds that exhaust their primary liability insurance coverage 
third  the hartford acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of risks previously assumed by other insurers writing primary  excess and reinsurance coverages 
fourth  the hartford participated as a london market company that wrote both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business 
with regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims  significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related settlement expenses 
conventional reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of these claims  particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux 
as a result of the factors discussed in the following paragraphs  the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures 
in particular  the hartford believes there is a high degree of uncertainty inherent in the estimation of asbestos loss reserves 
in the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures  factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include inadequate development patterns  plaintiffs expanding theories of liability  the risks inherent in major litigation and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines 
courts have reached inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage  what types of losses are covered  whether there is an insurer obligation to defend  how policy limits are determined  whether particular claims are product completed operation claims subject to an aggregate limit and how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted 
furthermore  insurers in general  including the hartford  have recently experienced an increase in the number of asbestos related claims due to  among other things  more intensive advertising by lawyers  seeking asbestos claimants  plaintiffs increased focus on new and previously peripheral defendants and an increase in the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities 
plaintiffs and insureds have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers 
in addition some policyholders have begun to assert new classes of claims for so called non product coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not apply 
recently  many insurers  including  in a limited number of instances  the hartford  also have been sued directly by asbestos claimants asserting that insurers had a duty to protect the public from the dangers of asbestos 
management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
in the case of the reserves for environmental exposures  factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include court decisions that have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than originally intended  inconsistent decisions  especially across jurisdictions and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured 
further uncertainties include the effect of the recent acceleration in the rate of bankruptcy filings by asbestos defendants on the rate and amount of the hartford s asbestos claims payments  a further increase or decrease in asbestos and environmental claims which cannot now be anticipated  whether some policyholders liabilities will reach the umbrella or excess layer of their coverage  the resolution or adjudication of some disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos claims in a manner inconsistent with the hartford s previous assessment of these claims  the number and outcome of direct actions against the hartford  and unanticipated developments pertaining to the hartford s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims 
it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims 
additionally  the reporting pattern for excess insurance and reinsurance claims is much longer than direct claims 
in many instances  it takes months or years to determine that the customer s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in question may apply to such claims 
the delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves 
given the factors and emerging trends described above  the hartford believes the actuarial tools and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for its asbestos and environmental exposures 
the hartford continually evaluates new information and new methodologies in assessing its potential asbestos exposures 
at any time  the hartford may be conducting an analysis of newly identified information 
completion of exposure analyses could cause the hartford to change its estimates of its asbestos and environmental reserves and the effect of these changes could be material to the company s consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
reserve activity reserves and reserve activity in the other operations segment are categorized and reported as asbestos  environmental or all other activity 
the discussion below relates to reserves and reserve activity  net of applicable reinsurance 
there are a wide variety of claims that drive the reserves associated with asbestos  environmental and all other categories the company has defined in other operations 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up costs 
the all other category of reserves covers a wide range of insurance coverages  including liability for breast implants  blood products  construction defects and lead paint 
the other operations historic book of business contains policies written from the s to  with the majority of the business spanning the interval to the hartford s experience has been that this book of business has over time produced significantly higher claims and losses than were contemplated at inception 
the areas of active claim activity have also shifted based on changes in plaintiff focus and the overall litigation environment 
a significant portion of the claim reserves of the other operations segment relates to exposure to the insurance businesses of other insurers or reinsurers whole account exposure 
many of these whole account exposures arise from reinsurance agreements previously written by the hartford 
the hartford s net exposure in these arrangements has increased for a variety of reasons including the hartford s commutation of previous retrocessions of such business 
due to the reporting practices of cedants to their reinsurers  determination of the nature of the individual risks involved in these whole account exposures such as asbestos  environmental  or other exposures requires various assumptions and estimates  which are subject to uncertainty  as previously discussed 
consistent with the company s long standing reserving practices  the hartford will continue to regularly review and monitor these reserves and  where future developments indicate  make appropriate adjustments to the reserves 
the loss reserving assumptions  drawn from both industry data and the company s experience  have over time been applied to all of this business and have resulted in strengthening or weakening actions at various times over the past decade 
during  the company observed a decrease in newly reported environmental claims as well as favorable settlements with respect to certain existing environmental claims 
both observations were consistent with longer term positive trends for environmental liabilities 
in the same period  consistent with the reports of other insurers  the hartford experienced an increase in the number of new asbestos claims by policyholders not previously identified as potentially significant claimants  including installers or handlers of asbestos containing products 
in addition  new classes of claims were beginning to arise whereby some policyholders were asserting that their asbestos related claims fall within so called non products coverage contained within their policies rather than products hazard coverage and that the claimed non products coverage was not subject to any aggregate limit 
also  as previously noted  the hartford consolidated management and claims handling responsibility of all of its asbestos and environmental exposures within other operations in based on a review of the environmental claim trends that was completed in the fourth quarter of under the supervision of the then newly consolidated management structure and in light of the further uncertainties posed by the foregoing asbestos trends  the company reclassified of environmental reserves to asbestos reserves 
during  as part of the company s ongoing monitoring of reserves  the company reclassified of reserves from the all other reserve category  of which was reclassified to asbestos and was reclassified to environmental claim reserves 
the increase in reserves categorized as environmental of as contrasted with the decrease in the fourth quarter of occurred because the reviews in each of the two periods employed actuarial techniques to analyze distinct and non overlapping blocks of reserves and associated exposures 
facts and circumstances associated with each block determined the resulting changes in category 
a portion of the reclassification relates to re estimates of the appropriate allocation among the asbestos  environmental and all other categories of the aggregate reserves net of reinsurance carried for certain assumed reinsurance  commuted cessions and commuted retrocessions of whole account business 
as part of the reclassification  the hartford also revised formulas that it will use to allocate among the asbestos  environmental and all other categories future claim payments for which reinsurance arrangements were commuted and to allocate claim payments made to effect commutations 
as a result of these revisions  payments categorized as asbestos and environmental exposures will be higher in future periods than in prior periods 
approximately of the reclassification resulted from changes in the estimates of the proportions of certain of the company s broad based liability and assumed reinsurance reserves that would more appropriately be categorized as asbestos or environmental reserves 
the change in allocation did not involve a change in the hartford s estimated net liability with respect to the policies in question 
instead  the company s estimate of what type of claims the insured would present against these liabilities changed 
to give an example when the company writes a broad reinsurance contract for another insurer  it gives the insurer the right to submit a variety of different types of claims  up to a limit  against that policy 
the company establishes a reserve for that policy that considers the exposure for total incurred claims under that policy 
over time  the company changes its view as to what type of claims may be presented  but its aggregate liability and appropriate reserve are less likely to change  particularly if the reserves are already at the limit payable under the policy 
the foregoing reduction of the all other reserves was related to the company s assessment of trends that suggested noteworthy changes in the claims made against these reserves 
these trends indicated that the categories of claims presented were becoming better defined 
in response to these noted trends  management decided to study whether sufficient information existed to change estimates of what portions of certain reserves were likely to be used for asbestos and environmental claims 
this study was completed in the second quarter of on a net basis  it resulted in approximately of reserves being categorized as likely to be associated with an environmental claim and approximately as likely to be associated with an asbestos claim 
this resulted in a reclassification of of reserves previously categorized in the all other category to the asbestos and environmental reserves categories  respectively 
in the review of non asbestos or non environmental latent exposures  the company noted that business written from to has produced less mass tort development over the ensuing years than was the case for the business written from to at the time of this review  the company developed an estimated actuarial range that indicated there could be a potential reserve deficiency but there was also a strong potential for reserve redundancy 
at that time  the company concluded that there was insufficient foundation to make a determination of redundancy and that to do so would be aggressive 
in the second quarter  the hartford also completed a separate but related study of liabilities other than asbestos and environmental exposures in other operations 
the study confirmed a continuation of the trends previously noted 
it also produced a conservative end of the actuarial range indicating no material potential deficiency 
with this new information  the company felt sufficient foundation existed to estimate a redundancy of approximately for reserves covering latent exposures in other operations other than asbestos and environmental 
while the company was conducting the foregoing studies  the company was also monitoring the continued adverse trends in the reporting and settlement of asbestos claims 
in light of these trends  which management believed likely to continue  management decided to increase the company s reserves for asbestos liability by approximately the following table presents reserve activity  inclusive of estimates for both reported and incurred but not reported claims  net of reinsurance  for other operations  categorized by asbestos  environmental and all other claims  for the years ended december   and also included are the remaining asbestos and environmental exposures of north american

direct policies include insurance policies issued to customers providing either primary coverage or excess of loss coverage over either the hartford s own primary policies or the primary policies of other insurance companies 
assumed reinsurance includes both treaty reinsurance covering broad categories of claims or blocks of business and facultative reinsurance covering specific risks or individual policies of primary or excess insurance companies 
london market business includes the business written by one or more subsidiaries in the united kingdom  which are no longer active in the insurance or reinsurance business 
such business includes both direct insurance and contracts of assumed reinsurance 
exposures on direct policies are the easiest to identify because specific policies can be associated with specific accounts and reserves established  where appropriate  for claims presented 
over the last three years  including the current reporting period  the company experienced a reduction in newly reported environmental claims on direct business  and actual claim payments have been made at levels within the company s previously established provisions for loss 
however  with respect to asbestos claims  the company experienced a variety of negative trends  including increasing number of policyholders making claims  an apparent increase in the number of claimants under such policies and an accelerated rate of policyholder bankruptcies 
the combination of such events has the total value of potential claims higher into the excess layers of the company s policies and into later years of coverage than had been expected 
assumed reinsurance claims treaty and facultative related to asbestos and environmental exposures continue to be reported by customers years after the expiration of their contracts with the company 
the reports the company has received during are largely related to asbestos and environmental claims and reflect the same trends as those of the direct policies  as previously discussed 
the asbestos and environmental liability components of the london market book of business consist of both direct policies of insurance and contracts of assumed reinsurance 
as a participant in the london market comprised of both lloyd s of london and london company markets  the company wrote business on a subscription basis  with the company s involvement being limited to a relatively small percentage of a total contract placement 
claims are reported  via a broker  to the lead underwriter and  once agreed to  are presented to the following markets for concurrence 
this reporting and claim agreement process makes estimating liabilities for this business the most uncertain of the three categories of claims direct  assumed domestic and london market 
over the last three years  the hartford has been experiencing lower than previously expected claim activity with respect to claims classified as environmental 
during the last two years  the hartford has been experiencing higher than previously expected claim activity with respect to claims classified as asbestos 
the increase in both the number of claims being submitted and the number of customer bankruptcies  being driven by asbestos related issues  have accelerated over the last year 
the following table sets forth  for the three years ended december   paid and incurred loss activity by the three categories of claims for asbestos and environmental 
the table shows that in this timeframe asbestos payments and incurred losses have been increasing  while environmental activity generally has been improving 
paid and incurred loss and loss adjustment expense lae development asbestos and environmental asbestos environmental paid incurred paid incurred loss lae loss lae loss lae loss lae gross direct assumed domestic london market total ceded net gross direct assumed domestic london market total ceded net gross direct assumed domestic london market total ceded net outlook as previously noted  the hartford reviews various components of its asbestos and environmental reserves on a periodic basis 
given the continuing adverse development experienced by the hartford  as well as the negative trends that the insurance industry as a whole has recently seen with respect to asbestos  it was determined that a more in depth and comprehensive review was necessary 
in january  the hartford announced a comprehensive ground up study of its asbestos related exposures  and expects the study to be completed by the second quarter this study will accomplish three objectives provide a ground up framework to evaluate the company s overall asbestos exposure  accumulate the detailed information necessary to provide even more detailed disclosures of the components of asbestos reserves  and evaluate the company s exposures in relation to current reserve levels 
investments general the hartford s investment portfolios are divided between life and property casualty 
the investment portfolios are managed based on the underlying characteristics and nature of each operation s respective liabilities and within established risk parameters 
for a further discussion of the hartford s approach to managing risks  see the capital markets risk management section 
the investment portfolios of life and property casualty are managed by hartford investment management company himco  a wholly owned subsidiary of the hartford 
himco is responsible for monitoring and managing the asset liability profile  establishing investment objectives and guidelines and determining  within specified risk tolerances and investment guidelines  the appropriate asset allocation  duration  convexity and other characteristics of the portfolios 
security selection and monitoring are performed by asset class specialists working within dedicated portfolio management teams 
return on general account invested assets is an important element of the hartford s financial results 
significant fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could weaken the company s financial condition or its results of operations 
net investment income and net realized capital gains and losses accounted for approximately  and of the company s consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fluctuations in interest rates affect the company s return on  and the fair value of  fixed maturity investments  which comprised approximately and of the fair value of its invested assets as of december  and  respectively 
other events beyond the company s control could also adversely impact the fair value of these investments 
specifically  a downgrade of an issuer s credit rating or default of payment by an issuer could reduce the company s investment return 
the company also invests in unaffiliated limited partnership arrangements in order to further diversify its investment portfolio 
these limited partnerships represent approximately and of the fair value of its invested assets as of december  and  respectively 
limited partnerships are typically less liquid than direct investments in fixed income or equity investments 
market volatility and other factors beyond the company s control can adversely affect the value of these investments 
because the company is a limited partner  its ability to control the timing or the realization of the related investment income is restricted 
a decrease in the fair value of any investment that is deemed other than temporary would result in the company s recognition of a realized loss in its financial results prior to the actual sale of the investment 
for a further discussion  see the company s discussion of evaluation of other than temporary impairment in critical accounting estimates under valuation of investments and derivative instruments 
life the primary investment objective of life s general account is to maximize after tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters  including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets and the generation of sufficient liquidity relative to that of corporate and policyholder obligations  as discussed in the capital markets risk management section under market risk life interest rate risk 
the weighted average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was and as of december  and  respectively 
duration is defined as the approximate percentage change in market price of the portfolio for a basis point change in interest rates 
for example  if interest rates increased by basis points  the fair value of the portfolio would be expected to decrease by approximately and as of december  and  respectively

private placement securities are generally less liquid than public securities 
however  private placements generally have covenants designed to compensate for liquidity risk 
most of the private placement securities in the life operation s portfolio are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies

these losses were partially offset by gains from the sale of fixed maturities 
separate account products separate account products are those for which a separate investment and liability account is maintained on behalf of the policyholder 
the company s separate accounts reflect two categories of risk assumption non guaranteed separate accounts totaling billion and billion as of december  and  respectively  wherein the policyholder assumes substantially all the risk and reward  and guaranteed separate accounts totaling billion and billion as of december  and  respectively  wherein the hartford contractually guarantees either a minimum return or the account value to the policyholder 
guaranteed separate account products primarily consist of modified guaranteed individual annuities and modified guaranteed life insurance and generally include market value adjustment features and surrender charges to mitigate the risk of disintermediation 
the primary investment objective of guaranteed separate accounts is to maximize after tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters  including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets relative to that of policyholder obligations  as discussed in the capital markets risk management section under market risk life interest rate risk 
investment objectives for non guaranteed separate accounts vary by fund account type  as outlined in the applicable fund prospectus or separate account plan of operations 
non guaranteed separate account products include variable annuities  variable life insurance contracts and variable coli 
property casualty the investment objective for the majority of property casualty is to maximize economic value while generating after tax income and sufficient liquidity to meet corporate and policyholder obligations 
for property casualty s other operations segment  the investment objective is to ensure the full and timely payment of all liabilities 
property casualty s investment strategies are developed based on a variety of factors including business needs  regulatory requirements and tax considerations 
the weighted average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was as of december  and duration is defined as the approximate percentage change in the market value of the portfolio for a basis point change in interest rates

investment portfolio management is organized to focus investment management expertise on specific classes of investments  while asset liability management is the responsibility of dedicated risk management units supporting life  including guaranteed separate accounts  and property casualty operations 
derivative instruments are utilized in compliance with established company policy and regulatory requirements and are monitored internally and reviewed by senior management 
the company is exposed to two primary sources of investment and asset liability management risk credit risk  relating to the uncertainty associated with the ability of an obligor or counterparty to make timely payments of principal and or interest  and market risk  relating to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates  securities prices  market indices  yield curves or currency exchange rates 
the company does not hold any financial instruments purchased for trading purposes 
credit risk the hartford has established investment credit policies that focus on the credit quality of obligors and counterparties  limit credit concentrations  encourage diversification and require frequent creditworthiness reviews 
investment activity  including setting of policy and defining acceptable risk levels  is subject to regular review and approval by senior management and by the company s finance committee of the board of directors 
the company invests primarily in securities which are rated investment grade and has established exposure limits  diversification standards and review procedures for all credit risks including borrower  issuer and counterparty 
creditworthiness of specific obligors is determined by an internal credit evaluation supplemented by consideration of external determinants of creditworthiness  typically ratings assigned by nationally recognized ratings agencies 
obligor  asset sector and industry concentrations are subject to established limits and monitored on a regular basis 
the hartford is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than of the company s stockholders equity 
derivative instruments the company s derivative counterparty exposure policy establishes market based credit limits  favors long term financial stability and creditworthiness and typically requires credit enhancement credit risk reducing agreements 
credit risk is measured as the amount owed to the company based on current market conditions and potential payment obligations between the company and its counterparties 
credit exposures are generally quantified weekly and netted  and collateral is pledged to and held by  or on behalf of  the company to the extent the current value of derivatives exceeds exposure policy thresholds 
the company periodically enters into swap agreements in which the company assumes credit exposure from a single entity  referenced index or asset pool 
total return swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments with other parties  at specified intervals  calculated using the agreed upon index and notional principal amounts 
generally  no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract 
typically  at the time a swap is entered into  the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value 
credit default swaps involve a transfer of credit risk from one party to another in exchange for periodic payments 
one party to the contract will make a payment based on an agreed upon rate and a notional amount 
the second party  who assumes credit exposures  will only make a payment when there is a credit event  and such payment will be equal to the notional value of the swap contract  and in return  the second party will receive the debt obligation of the first party 
a credit event is generally defined as default on contractually obligated interest or principal payment or restructure 
as of december  and the notional value of total return and credit default swaps totaled billion and  respectively  and the swap fair value totaled and  respectively

market risk the hartford has material exposure to both interest rate and equity market risk 
the company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including multi scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments  including derivative instruments 
the hartford has several objectives in managing market risk associated with life and property casualty 
life is responsible for maximizing after tax returns within acceptable risk parameters  including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets and the generation of sufficient liquidity to that of corporate and policyholder obligations 
life s fixed maturity portfolios have material market exposure to interest rate risk 
property casualty attempts to maximize economic value while generating appropriate after tax income and sufficient liquidity to meet corporate and policyholder obligations 
property casualty has material exposure to interest rate and equity market risk 
the company continually monitors these exposures and makes portfolio adjustments to manage these risks within established limits 
downward movement in market interest rates during resulted in a significant increase in the unrealized appreciation of the fixed maturity security portfolio from however  the hartford s asset allocation and its exposure to market risk as of december  have not changed materially from its position at december  the company is subject to the risk of a change in financial condition due to the effect of interest rate and equity market fluctuations on the calculation of the company s minimum pension liabilities 
as discussed in the capital resources and liquidity section  in the fourth quarter  the company recorded a minimum pension liability charge directly to stockholders equity of  after tax 
derivative instruments the hartford utilizes a variety of derivative instruments  including swaps  caps  floors  forwards and exchange traded futures and options  in compliance with company policy and regulatory requirements in order to achieve one of four company approved objectives to hedge risk arising from interest rate  price or currency exchange rate volatility  to manage liquidity  to control transaction costs  or to enter into income enhancement and replication transactions 
interest rate swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments with other parties  at specified intervals  calculated using the agreed upon rates and notional principal amounts 
generally  no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract 
typically  at the time a swap is entered into  the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value 
foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies  agreeing to re exchange the currencies at a future date  at an agreed exchange rate 
there is also periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts 
interest rate cap and floor contracts entitle the purchaser to receive from the issuer at specified dates  the amount  if any  by which a specified market rate exceeds the cap strike rate or falls below the floor strike rate  applied to a notional principal amount 
a premium payment is made by the purchaser of the contract at its inception  and no principal payments are exchanged 
forward contracts are customized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments  at a future date  for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument 
financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments  at a future date  for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument 
futures contracts trade on organized exchanges 
margin requirements for futures are met by pledging securities  and changes in the futures contract values are settled daily in cash 
option contracts grant the purchaser  for a premium payment  the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price  within a specified period or on a stated date 
derivative activities are monitored by an internal compliance unit  reviewed frequently by senior management and reported to the finance committee of the board of directors 
the notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk 
notional amounts pertaining to derivative instruments used in the management of market risk for both general and guaranteed separate accounts at december  and totaled billion and billion  respectively 
the following discussions focus on the key market risk exposures within life and property casualty 
life interest rate risk life s general account and guaranteed separate account exposure to interest rate risk relates to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates 
changes in interest rates can potentially impact life s profitability 
in certain scenarios where interest rates are volatile  life could be exposed to disintermediation risk and reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margins 
life s general account and guaranteed separate account investment portfolios primarily consist of investment grade  fixed maturity securities  including corporate bonds  asset backed securities  commercial mortgage backed securities  tax exempt municipal securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the fair value of these and life s other invested assets fluctuates depending on the interest rate environment and other general economic conditions 
during periods of declining interest rates  paydowns on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations increase as the underlying mortgages are prepaid 
during such periods  the company generally will not be able to reinvest the proceeds of any such prepayments at comparable yields 
conversely  during periods of rising interest rates  the rate of prepayments generally declines  exposing the company to the possibility of asset liability cash flow and yield mismatch 
for further discussion of the company s risk management techniques to manage this market risk  see the asset and liability management strategies used to manage market risk discussed below 
as described above  life holds a significant fixed maturity portfolio that includes both fixed and variable rate securities 
the following table reflects the principal amounts of life s general and guaranteed separate accounts fixed and variable rate fixed maturity portfolios  along with the respective weighted average coupons by estimated maturity year at december  comparative totals are included as of december  expected maturities differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment provisions 
the weighted average coupon wac on variable rate securities is based on spot rates as of december  and  and is primarily based on london interbank offered rate libor 
callable bonds and notes are distributed to either call dates or maturity  depending on which date produces the most conservative yield 
asset backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities are distributed based on estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities 
these estimates are developed using prepayment speeds provided in broker consensus data

asset and liability management strategies used to manage market risk life employs several risk management tools to quantify and manage market risk arising from their investments and interest sensitive liabilities 
for certain portfolios  management monitors the changes in present value between assets and liabilities resulting from various interest rate scenarios using integrated asset liability measurement systems and a proprietary system that simulates the impacts of parallel and non parallel yield curve shifts 
based on this current and prospective information  management implements risk reducing techniques to improve the match between assets and liabilities 
derivatives play an important role in facilitating the management of interest rate risk  creating opportunities to efficiently fund obligations  hedge against risks that affect the value of certain liabilities and adjust broad investment risk characteristics as a result of any significant changes in market risks 
life uses a variety of derivatives  including swaps  caps  floors  forwards and exchange traded financial futures and options  in order to hedge exposure primarily to interest rate risk on anticipated investment purchases or existing assets and liabilities 
at december   notional amounts pertaining to derivatives totaled billion billion related to insurance investments and billion related to life insurance liabilities 
notional amounts pertaining to derivatives totaled billion at december  billion related to insurance investments and billion related to life insurance liabilities 
the economic objectives and strategies for which the company utilizes derivatives are categorized as follows anticipatory hedging for certain liabilities  the company commits to the price of the product prior to receipt of the associated premium or deposit 
anticipatory hedges are executed to offset the impact of changes in asset prices arising from interest rate changes pending the receipt of premium or deposit and the subsequent purchase of an asset 
these hedges involve taking a long position purchase in interest rate futures or entering into an interest rate swap with duration characteristics equivalent to the associated liabilities or anticipated investments 
the notional amounts of anticipatory hedges as of december  and were and  respectively 
liability hedging several products obligate the company to credit a return to the contract holder which is indexed to a market rate 
to hedge risks associated with these products  the company enters into various derivative contracts 
interest rate swaps are used to convert the contract rate into a rate that trades in a more liquid and efficient market 
this hedging strategy enables the company to customize contract terms and conditions to customer objectives and satisfies the operation s asset liability matching policy 
in addition  interest rate swaps are used to convert certain variable contract rates to different variable rates  thereby allowing them to be appropriately matched against variable rate assets 
finally  interest rate caps and option contracts are used to hedge against the risk of contract holder disintermediation in a rising interest rate environment 
the notional amounts of derivatives used for liability hedging as of december  and were billion 
asset hedging to meet the various policyholder obligations and to provide cost effective  prudent investment risk diversification  the company may combine two or more financial instruments to achieve the investment characteristics of a fixed maturity security or that match an associated liability 
the use of derivative instruments in this regard effectively transfers unwanted investment risks or attributes to others 
the selection of the appropriate derivative instruments depends on the investment risk  the liquidity and efficiency of the market and the asset and liability characteristics 
the notional amounts of asset hedges as of december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
portfolio hedging the company periodically compares the duration and convexity of its portfolios of assets to its corresponding liabilities and enters into portfolio hedges to reduce any difference to desired levels 
portfolio hedges reduce the duration and convexity mismatch between assets and liabilities and offset the potential impact to cash flows caused by changes in interest rates 
the notional amounts of portfolio hedges as of december  and were and billion  respectively 
the following tables provide information as of december  with comparative totals for december  on derivative instruments used in accordance with the aforementioned hedging strategies

in order to manage a portion of these currency exposures  the company enters into foreign currency swaps to hedge the variability in cash flow associated with certain foreign denominated securities 
these foreign currency swap agreements are structured to match the foreign currency cash flows of the hedged foreign denominated securities 
at december  and  the foreign currency swaps had a notional value of and  respectively  and fair value of and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a costless collar strategy to temporarily mitigate a portion of its residual currency risk in foreign denominated securities 
accordingly  the company purchased foreign put options and wrote foreign call options expiring in january at december  the foreign put and call options had a notional value of and fair value of 
the company had no foreign put or call options at december  life product liability characteristics life s product liabilities  other than non guaranteed separate accounts  include accumulation vehicles such as fixed and variable annuities  other investment and universal life type contracts and other insurance products such as long term disability and term life insurance 
asset accumulation vehicles while interest rate risk associated with these insurance products has been reduced through the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges  the primary risk associated with these products is that the spread between investment return and credited rate may not be sufficient to earn targeted returns 
fixed rate products in this category require the payment of a fixed rate for a certain period of time 
the cash flows are not interest sensitive because the products are written with a market value adjustment feature and the liabilities have protection against the early withdrawal of funds through surrender charges 
product examples include fixed rate annuities with a market value adjustment and fixed rate guaranteed investment contracts 
contract duration is dependent on the policyholder s choice of guarantee period 
indexed products in this category are similar to the fixed rate asset accumulation vehicles but require the life operations to pay a rate that is determined by an external index 
the amount and or timing of cash flows will therefore vary based on the level of the particular index 
the primary risks inherent in these products are similar to the fixed rate asset accumulation vehicles  with the additional risk that changes in the index may adversely affect profitability 
product examples include indexed guaranteed investment contracts with an estimated duration of up to two years 
interest credited products in this category credit interest to policyholders  subject to market conditions and minimum guarantees 
policyholders may surrender at book value but are subject to surrender charges for an initial period 
product examples include universal life contracts and the general account portion of life s variable annuity products 
liability duration is short to intermediate term 
other insurance products long term pay out liabilities products in this category are long term in nature and may contain significant actuarial including mortality and morbidity pricing and cash flow risks 
the cash flows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest rate sensitive but do vary based on the timing and amount of benefit payments 
the primary risks associated with these products are that the benefits will exceed expected actuarial pricing and or that the actual timing of the cash flows differ from those anticipated  resulting in an investment return lower than that assumed in pricing 
product examples include structured settlement contracts  on benefit annuities ie  the annuitant is currently receiving benefits thereon and long term disability contracts 
contract duration is generally five to ten years 
short term pay out liabilities these liabilities are short term in nature with a duration of less than one year 
the primary risks associated with these products are determined by the non investment contingencies such as mortality or morbidity and the variability in the timing of the expected cash flows 
liquidity is of greater concern than for the long term pay out liabilities 
products include individual and group term life insurance contracts and short term disability contracts 
management of the duration of investments with respective policyholder obligations is an explicit objective of life s management strategy

sensitivity to changes in interest rates for liabilities whose cash flows are not substantially affected by changes in interest rates fixed liabilities and where investment experience is substantially absorbed by life  the sensitivity of the net economic value discounted present value of asset cash flows less the discounted present value of liability cash flows of those portfolios to basis point shifts in interest rates is shown in the following table 
change in net economic value basis point shift amount percent of liability value these fixed liabilities represented about and of life s general and guaranteed separate account liabilities at december  and  respectively 
the remaining liabilities generally allow life significant flexibility to adjust credited rates to reflect actual investment experience and thereby pass through a substantial portion of actual investment experience to the policyholder 
the fixed liability portfolios are managed and monitored relative to defined objectives  are analyzed regularly by management for internal risk management purposes using scenario simulation techniques and are evaluated on an annual basis  in compliance with regulatory requirements 
equity risk the company s life operations are significantly influenced by changes in the equity markets 
life s profitability depends largely on the amount of assets under management  which is primarily driven by the level of sales  equity market appreciation and depreciation and the persistency of the in force block of business 
a prolonged and precipitous decline in the equity markets  as has been experienced of late  can have a significant impact on the company s operations  as sales of variable products may decline and surrender activity may increase  as customer sentiment towards the equity market turns negative 
the lower assets under management will have a negative impact on the company s financial results  primarily due to lower fee income related to the investment products and individual life segments  where a heavy concentration of equity linked products are administered and sold 
furthermore  the company may experience a reduction in profit margins if a significant portion of the assets held in the variable annuity separate accounts move to the general account and the company is unable to earn an acceptable investment spread  particularly in light of the low interest rate environment and the presence of contractually guaranteed minimum interest credited rates  which for the most part are at a rate 
in addition  prolonged declines in the equity market may also decrease the company s expectations of future gross profits  which are utilized to determine the amount of dac to be amortized in a given financial statement period 
a significant decrease in the company s estimated gross profits would require the company to accelerate the amount of dac amortization in a given period  potentially causing a material adverse deviation in that period s net income 
although an acceleration of dac amortization would have a negative impact on the company s earnings  it would not affect the company s cash flow or liquidity position 
additionally  the investment products segment sells variable annuity contracts that offer various guaranteed death benefits 
for certain guaranteed death benefits  the hartford pays the greater of the account value at death  the sum of all premium payments less prior withdrawals  or the maximum anniversary value of the contract  plus any premium payments since the contract anniversary  minus any withdrawals following the contract anniversary 
the company currently reinsures a significant portion of these death benefit guarantees associated with its in force block of business 
the company currently records the death benefit costs  net of reinsurance  as they are incurred 
declines in the equity market may increase the company s net exposure to death benefits under these contracts 
the company s total gross exposure ie before reinsurance to these guaranteed death benefits as of december  is billion 
due to the fact that of this amount is reinsured  the company s net exposure is billion 
this amount is often referred to as the net amount at risk 
however  the company will only incur these guaranteed death benefit payments in the future if the policyholder has an in the money guaranteed death benefit at their time of death 
in order to analyze the total costs that the company may incur in the future related to these guaranteed death benefits  the company performed an actuarial present value analysis 
this analysis included developing a model utilizing stochastically generated investment performance scenarios and best estimate assumptions related to mortality and lapse rates 
a range of projected costs was developed and discounted back to the statement date utilizing the company s cost of capital  which for this purpose was assumed to be 
based on this analysis  the company estimated that the present value of the retained death benefit costs to be incurred in the future fell within a range of to this range was calculated utilizing a confidence interval 
the median of the stochastically generated scenarios was furthermore  the company is involved in arbitration with one of its primary reinsurers relating to policies with such death benefit guarantees written from to the arbitration involves alleged breaches under the reinsurance treaties 
although the company believes that its position in this pending arbitration is strong  an adverse outcome could result in a decrease to the company s statutory surplus and capital and potentially increase the death benefit costs incurred by the company in the future 
the arbitration hearing was held during the fourth quarter of  but no decision has been rendered

if the commitment period expires and the commitment has not been fully funded  the hartford is not required to fund the remaining unfunded commitment but may elect to do so 
capitalization the hartford endeavors to maintain a capital structure that provides financial and operational flexibility to its insurance subsidiaries  ratings that support its competitive position in the financial services marketplace see the ratings section below for further discussion  and strong shareholder returns 
as a result  the company may from time to time raise capital from the issuance of stock  debt or other capital securities 
the issuance of common stock  debt or other capital securities could result in the dilution of shareholder interests or reduced net income due to additional interest expense 
during the third quarter of  the company increased its capitalization by through the issuance of in common stock and in equity units 
proceeds of were contributed to the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries  proceeds of were contributed to the life insurance subsidiaries and the balance has been held for general corporate purposes  which may include additional capital contributions to the insurance subsidiaries 
in addition  as was the case after september  the company may use the capital markets to replace capital upon completion of its asbestos review 
during the year ended december   the hartford s total capitalization increased by billion  while total capitalization excluding aoci increased by billion 
this increase was a result of net income  the aforementioned third quarter capital raising activities  and stock issued related to stock compensation plans 
these increases were partially offset by dividends declared 
aoci aoci increased by as of december  compared with december  the increase resulted primarily from the impact of decreased interest rates on unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio  the recognition of unrealized losses on other than temporary impairments on fixed maturity and equity securities and the net gain on cash flow hedging instruments  partially offset by an increase in the company s minimum pension liability adjustment 
the funded status of the company s pension and postretirement plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates 
recent declines in the value of securities traded in equity markets coupled with declines in long term interest rates have had a negative impact on the funded status of the plans 
as a result  the company has recorded a minimum pension liability as of december   which resulted in an after tax reduction of stockholders equity of this minimum pension liability did not affect the company s results of operations 
aoci increased by as of december  compared with december  the increase resulted primarily from the impact of decreased interest rates on unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio  the recognition of unrealized losses on other than temporary impairments on fixed maturity and equity securities and the net gain on cash flow hedging instruments

each equity unit offered initially consists of a corporate unit with a stated amount of 
each corporate unit consists of one purchase contract for the sale of a certain number of shares of the company s stock and principal amount of senior notes due november  the corporate unit may be converted by the holder into a treasury unit consisting of the purchase contract and a undivided beneficial interest in a zero coupon us treasury security with a principal amount of one thousand dollars that matures on november  the holder of an equity unit owns the underlying senior notes or treasury portfolio but has pledged the senior notes or treasury portfolio to the company to secure the holder s obligations under the purchase contract 
the purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase  and obligates the hartford to sell  on november   for  a variable number of newly issued common shares of the hartford 
the number of the hartford s shares to be issued will be determined at the time the purchase contracts are settled based upon the then current price of the hartford s common stock 
if the price of the hartford s common stock is equal to or less than  then the company will deliver shares to the holder of the equity unit 
if the price of the hartford s common stock is greater than but less than  then the company will deliver a fraction of shares equal to divided by the then current price of the hartford s common stock 
finally  if the price of the hartford s common stock is equal to or greater than  then the company will deliver shares to the holder 
accordingly  upon settlement of the purchase contracts on november   the hartford will receive proceeds of approximately and will deliver between million and million common shares in the aggregate 
the proceeds will be credited to stockholders equity and allocated between the common stock and additional paid in capital accounts 
the hartford will make quarterly contract adjustment payments to the equity unit holders at a rate of of the stated amount per year until the purchase contract is settled

additional paid in capital as of december  reflected a charge of approximately representing a portion of the equity unit issuance costs that were allocated to the purchase contracts 
the equity units have been reflected in the diluted earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method  which would be used for the equity units at any time before the issuance of shares of the hartford s common stock upon settlement of the purchase contracts 
under the treasury stock method  the number of shares of common stock used in calculating diluted earnings per share is increased by the excess  if any  of the number of shares issuable upon settlement of the purchase contracts over the number of shares that could be purchased by the hartford in the market  at the average market price during the period  using the proceeds received upon settlement 
the company anticipates that there will be no dilutive effect on its earnings per share related to the equity units  except during periods when the average market price of a share of the company s common stock is above the threshold appreciation price of 
because the average market price of the hartford s common stock during the period from date of issuance through december  was below this threshold appreciation price  the shares issuable under the purchase contract component of the equity units have not been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the period

pension plans and other postretirement benefits the company maintains a us qualified defined benefit pension plan the plan that covers substantially all employees  as well as unfunded excess plans to provide benefits in excess of amounts permitted to be paid to participants of the plan under the provisions of the internal revenue code 
additionally  the company has entered into individual retirement agreements with certain current and retired directors providing for unfunded supplemental pension benefits 
the company made a voluntary contribution of in cash to the plan in and made no contributions in or pension expense reflected in the company s operating earnings was  and in  and  respectively 
the company estimates its pension expense will be approximately  based on current assumptions provided below 
the assumptions that primarily impact the amount of the company s pension obligations and periodic pension expense are the weighted average discount rate and the asset portfolio s long term rate of return 
in determining the discount rate assumption  the company utilizes information provided by its plan actuaries 
in particular  the company uses an interest rate yield curve developed and published by its plan actuaries to make judgments pursuant to eitf topic no 
d  selection of discount rates used for measuring defined benefit pension obligations and obligations of postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
the yield curve is comprised of aaa aa bonds with maturities between zero and thirty years 
discounting the cash flows of the company s pension plan using this yield curve  it was determined that is the appropriate discount rate as of december  to calculate the company s accrued benefit cost liability 
accordingly  as prescribed by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the discount rate will also be used to determine the company s pension expense 
the company determines the long term rate of return assumption for the plan s asset portfolio based on analysis of the portfolio s historical compound rates of return since the earliest date for which comparable portfolio data is available over rolling year  year and year periods  balanced along with future long term return expectations 
the company selected these periods  as well as shorter durations  to assess the portfolio s volatility  duration and total returns as they relate to pension obligation characteristics  which are influenced by the company s workforce demographics 
while the historical return of the plan s portfolio has been since  management lowered its long term rate of return assumption from to as of december  based on its long term outlook with respect to the markets  which has been influenced by the poor equity market performance in recent years coupled with the recent decline in fixed income security yields during the plan s asset portfolio is generally structured over time to include approximately equity securities substantially securities issued by united states based companies and fixed income securities substantially investment grade and above 
at december   the portfolio composition varied from the targeted mix and was approximately equity securities and fixed income securities due in part to declines in the equity markets and declining interest rates 
as provided for under sfas no 
 the company uses a five year averaging method to determine the market related value of plan assets  which is used to determine the expected return component of pension expense 
under this methodology  asset gains losses that result from returns that differ from the company s long term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market related value of assets on a level basis over a five year period 
due primarily to the unfavorable performance of the equity markets in and  the actual asset return loss for the plan was and for the years ended december  and  respectively  as compared to an expected return of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these differentials will be fully reflected in the market related value of plan assets over the next five years using the methodology described above 
the effect of the asset return loss has caused the level of unrecognized net losses to exceed the allowable amortization corridor as defined under sfas no 
based on the selected discount rate of and taking into account estimated future minimum funding  the differential between actual and expected performance in will increase annual pension expense in future years by approximately in  increasing to approximately in additionally  the decrease in the long term rate of return assumption from to is expected to increase the company s annual pension expense by approximately during  the change in the discount rate from as of december  to as of december  increased the projected benefit obligation pbo by the effect of this increase in pbo will serve to increase annual pension expense by approximately  assuming no future changes in discount rates going forward 
changes in the economic assumptions used to determine pension expense will impact the company s pension expense 
as mentioned earlier  the two economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension expense are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return 
to illustrate the impact of these assumptions on annual pension expense for and going forward  a basis point change in the discount rate will increase decrease pension expense by approximately  and a basis point change in the long term asset return assumption will increase decrease pension expense by approximately while the company has significant discretion in making voluntary contributions to the plan  the employee retirement income security act of regulations mandate minimum contributions in certain circumstances 
under current assumptions  the required minimum funding contributions are estimated to be approximately cash flow net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used for investing activities    net cash provided by used for financing activities   cash end of year compared to the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of higher net income reported for the year ended december  than for the prior year as well as an increase in income tax refunds received in compared with the prior year 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of increased proceeds from investment and universal life type contracts  partially offset by lower proceeds received from issuances of common stock and no issuances of trust preferred securities in the increase in cash from financing activities accounted for the majority of the change in cash for investing activities 
compared to the increase in cash from financing activities was the result of current year proceeds on investment type contracts versus the prior year disbursements for investment type contracts and financing activities related to fortis and september cash provided by financing and operating activities accounted for the majority of the change in cash for investing activities 
the cash flows from operating activities were comparable with prior year 
operating cash flows in each of the last three years have been adequate to meet liquidity requirements

liquidity requirements the liquidity requirements of the hartford have been and will continue to be met by funds from operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper  common stock  debt securities and borrowings from its credit facilities 
the principal sources of operating funds are premiums and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets 
the hartford financial services group  inc is a holding company which receives operating cash flow in the form of dividends from its subsidiaries  enabling it to service debt  pay dividends on its common stock and pay certain business expenses 
dividends to the hartford financial services group  inc from its subsidiaries are restricted 
the payment of dividends by connecticut domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of connecticut

the primary uses of funds are to pay claims  policy benefits  operating expenses and commissions and to purchase new investments

terrorism risk insurance act of on november   president bush signed the terrorism risk insurance act of the act into law 
the act established a program that will run through that provides a backstop for insurance related losses resulting from any act of terrorism certified by the secretary of the treasury  in concurrence with the secretary of state and attorney general 
the act created a program under which the federal government will pay of covered losses after an insurer s losses exceed a deductible determined by a statutorily prescribed formula  up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of billion 
if an act of terrorism or acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the billion annual limit  insurers with losses exceeding their deductibles will not be responsible for additional losses 
the statutory formula for determining a company s deductible for each year is based on the company s direct commercial earned premiums for the prior calendar year multiplied by a specified percentage 
the specified percentages are for  for and for for example  based on the hartford s direct commercial earned premiums of billion  the hartford s deductible would be the act applies to a significant portion of the hartford s commercial property and casualty contracts  but it specifically excludes some of the hartford s other insurance business  including crop or livestock insurance  reinsurance and personal lines business 
the act currently does not apply to group life insurance contracts but permits the secretary of the treasury to extend the backstop protection to them 
the act requires all property and casualty insurers  including the hartford  to make terrorism insurance coverage available in all of their covered commercial property and casualty insurance policies as defined in the act 
the hartford will evaluate risks with terrorism exposures by applying its internally developed underwriting guidelines and control plans 
the hartford does not anticipate significant increases in premiums due to the act 
risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners naic has regulations establishing minimum capitalization requirements based on risk based capital rbc formulas for both life and property and casualty companies 
the requirements consist of formulas  which identify companies that are undercapitalized and require specific regulatory actions 
the rbc formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks 
rbc is calculated for property and casualty companies after adjusting capital for certain underwriting  asset  credit and off balance sheet risks 
as of december   each of the hartford s insurance subsidiaries within life and property casualty had more than sufficient capital to meet the naic s rbc requirements 
contingencies legal proceedings the hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business  both as a liability insurer defending third party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it 
the hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid claim and claim adjustment expense reserves 
subject to the discussion of the litigation involving macarthur in part i  item legal proceedings and the uncertainties related to asbestos and environmental claims discussed in the md a under the caption other operations  management expects that the ultimate liability  if any  with respect to such ordinary course claims litigation  after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense  will not be material to the consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows of the hartford 
the hartford is also involved in other kinds of legal actions  some of which assert claims for substantial amounts 
these actions include  among others  putative state and federal class actions seeking certification of a state or national class 
such putative class actions have alleged  for example  underpayment of claims or improper underwriting practices in connection with various kinds of insurance policies  such as personal and commercial automobile  premises liability and inland marine 
the hartford also is involved in individual actions in which punitive damages are sought  such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims 
management expects that the ultimate liability  if any  with respect to such lawsuits  after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense  will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of the hartford 
nonetheless  given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions  and the inherent unpredictability of litigation  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could  from time to time  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
dependence on certain third party relationships the company distributes its annuity  life and certain property and casualty insurance products through a variety of distribution channels  including broker dealers  banks  wholesalers  its own internal sales force and other third party organizations 
the company periodically negotiates provisions and renewals of these relationships and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to the company or such third parties 
an interruption in the company s continuing relationship with certain of these third parties could materially affect the company s ability to market its products 
legislative initiatives federal measures which have been previously considered or enacted by congress and which  if revisited  could affect the insurance business include tax law changes pertaining to the tax treatment of insurance companies and life insurance and annuity products  as well as changes in individual income tax rates and the estate tax 
these changes could have an impact on the relative desirability of various personal investment vehicles 
legislation to restructure the social security system  expand private pension plans  and create new retirement savings incentives also may be considered 
the bush administration s fiscal year budget contains several proposals that could materially affect the company s business 
in particular  there are proposals that would more fully integrate corporate and individual taxes by permitting the distribution of nontaxable dividends to shareholders under certain circumstances 
these proposals  if enacted  could have a material effect on sales of the company s variable annuities and other retirement savings products  as well as implications for the company s shareholders  both with respect to the amount of taxable dividends received  as well as the price of and tax basis in their holdings of the company s common stock 
the dividend exclusion proposal  if enacted  also would reduce the federal tax benefits currently received by the company stemming from the dividends received deduction 
there also are proposals in the federal budget submitted by president bush that would create new investment vehicles with larger annual contribution limits for individuals to use for savings purposes 
some of these proposed vehicles would have significant tax advantages  and could have material effects on the company s product portfolio 
there have also been proposals regarding certain deferred compensation arrangements that could have negative effects on the company s product sales 
prospects for enactment of this legislation in are uncertain 
therefore  any potential effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
congress is likely to consider a number of legal reform proposals this year 
among them is legislation that would reduce the number and type of national class actions certified by state judges by updating the federal rules on diversity jurisdiction 
other proposals that will likely be considered by congress this year include those to reform the asbestos litigation environment by  among other things  implementing medical criteria that must be met by asbestos claimants or establishing an administrative claims facility to compensate those with asbestos related injuries 
prospects for enactment of these proposals in are uncertain 
insolvency fund in all states  insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of an insolvency fund 
in most states  in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing any such class of insurance in the state  members of the fund are assessed to pay certain claims of the insolvent insurer 
a particular state s fund assesses its members based on their respective written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer is engaged 
assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of premiums written per year depending on the state 
such assessments paid by the hartford approximated in  in and in naic codification the naic adopted the codification of statutory accounting principles codification in march the effective date for the statutory accounting guidance was january  each of the hartford s domiciliary states has adopted codification  and the company has made the necessary changes in its statutory reporting required for implementation 
the impact of applying the new guidance resulted in a benefit of approximately in statutory surplus
