item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company organization and overview company organization the term vse or company refers to vse and its subsidiaries and divisions unless the context indicates operations of the parent company only 
vse s business operations consist primarily of services performed by the company s wholly owned subsidiaries and divisions 
wholly owned subsidiaries include energetics incorporated energetics  human resource systems  inc hrsi  ship remediation and recycling  inc srr and vse services inter national  inc vsi 
unincorporated divisions include bav division bav  coast guard division vcg beginning in february  fleet maintenance division fleet maintenance  gsa services division gsa services  management sciences division msd beginning in december  ordnance division ordnance  systems engineering division systems engineering  formerly land systems division beginning in february  telecommunications technologies division ttd beginning in september  and value systems services division vss 
as of december   srr  vsi  gsa services  and ordnance are not conducting any current business operations 
work contracted under gsa schedules is performed directly by each of the operating divisions or subsidiaries 
in february  vse decided to no longer market the services provided by ttd and intends to phase out the operations of this division during due to competitive pressures  several of the company s operating divisions were formed in recent years to bid on and perform contract work that had been previously performed by vse parent company 
the formation of these divisions has enabled the company to use an operating structure that is more flexible and better suited to perform certain types of contract work 
the company anticipates that it will continue using its operating divisions to bid and perform new contract work to better serve the needs of customers 
management believes that the use of operating divisions to perform future work and the associated improvements in servicing customers will better position the consolidated entity for future revenue growth 
overview of services the company is engaged principally in providing engineering  design  logistics  management and technical services to the us government the government  other government prime contractors  and commercial entities 
the largest customer for the services rendered by the company is the us department of defense defense  including agencies of the us army  navy  and air force 
bav is a major provider of logistics  training  and technical assistance in support of the navy s ship transfer program 
fleet maintenance  ordnance in and prior  and vss also support the navy by providing a variety of services including ship installation efforts  combat systems inspections  ship repair and overhaul availability planning  harpoon weapons management  ordnance alteration  air combat logistics  and outsourcing decision assistance 
srr in and prior has provided environmentally sound solutions for the dismantling and disposal of inactive ships 
systems engineering provides the army with engineering and technical support for ground weapons  logistics and training services  material procurement support  and prototype development support for combat vehicles 
msd provides the army and other government agencies and commercial organizations with quality training services for product  process  and management optimization 
vse also provides services to other government agencies and industry 
the company has provided support services to the us postal service for over twenty years and is continuing to support this customer through its hrsi subsidiary 
energetics is focused on providing the department of energy and other government and industry customers with expert consulting services in environmental management and energy supply  resource management  and conserva tion 
ttd has offered the latest products  services  and support in network  multimedia  and audio visual technology 
this includes design  installation  management and support for a wide variety of voice  data  multimedia and related projects 
these projects include intelligent conference rooms which provide an ideal balance between technology and human interaction 
vse will transfer many of the technical capabilities of ttd to other divisions when ttd operations cease in substantially all of the company s services are performed for its customers on a contract basis 
the three primary types of contracts used are cost type contracts  time and materials contracts  and fixed price contracts 
revenues result from work performed on these contracts by the company s employees and from pass through of costs for material and work performed by subcontractors 
revenues on cost type contracts are recorded as contract allowable costs are incurred and fees earned 
profits on cost type contracts are equal to the fees that are earned 
the company has a contract in its bav division for which contract terms specify award fee payments to bav that are determined by performance and level of contract activity 
award fees are made three times during the year and a contract modification authorizing the award fee payment is issued subsequent to the period in which the work is performed 
the company does not recognize award fee income until the contract modification authorizing the award fee is issued 
due to such timing  and to fluctuations in the level of revenues  profits as a percentage of revenues on this contract will fluctuate from period to period 
revenues for time and materials contracts are recorded on the basis of contract allowable labor hours worked times the contract defined billing rates  plus the cost of materials used in performance on the contract 
profits on time and material contracts result from the difference between the cost of services performed and the contract defined billing rates for these services 
revenues on certain fixed price services contracts are recorded each period based on a monthly amount for services provided 
revenues on other fixed price contracts are recorded as costs are incurred  using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
profits on fixed price contracts result from the difference between the incurred costs and the revenue earned 
the company will occasionally perform work at risk  which is work that is performed prior to formalizing contract terms for such work 
potential revenue related to work performed at risk is not recognized until it can be reliably estimated and its realization is probable 
vse recognizes this risk funding as revenue when the associated costs are incurred or the work is performed 
as of december   vse has recognized approximately thousand in risk funding 
the company provides for anticipated losses on contracts by a charge to income during the period in which losses are first identified 
revenues by contract type for the three years ended december   were as follows in thousands contract type revenues revenues revenues cost    time and materials    fixed price    critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
in addition to our revenue recognition policy  discussed under overview of services above  we believe the following critical accounting polices affect our more significant judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
contingencies from time to time we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  labor and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and establish reserves accordingly 
the amount of reserves required may change in future periods due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach to a matter such as a change in settlement strategy 
income taxes the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on assumptions regarding our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets 
if the estimates and related assumptions regarding our future taxable income change in the future  we may be required to record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  resulting in additional income tax expense

revenues increased by approximately for the year ended december  and declined by approximately for the year ended december  the increase in revenues during was primarily due to an increase in the level of services ordered under the bav contract see bav contract below  the start up of new businesses see business termination and new business start up below  and increased sales in fleet maintenance 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues associated with closing srr see business termina tion and new business start up below and the expiration of the ordnance contract see contract expirations below 
the decrease in revenues during was primarily due to a decrease in the level of services ordered under the bav contract  the expiration of a contract performed by vse for the us postal service see contract expirations below  and a reduction in revenue associated with the company s sale of its hrsi health care division contracts in july the reduction in revenue from these contracts in was partially offset by increases in revenues in some of the company s other divisions and subsidiaries  including increased revenues in ttd  srr  and energetics 
bav contract 
vse s bav division has a contract with the us navy to provide engineering  technical and logistical support services associated with the sale  lease  or transfer of navy ships to foreign governments 
this contract is a ten year contract awarded in  and it has the potential to generate total revenues of over one billion dollars from through bav has recognized revenues on this contract of approximately million through december   resulting in a backlog of potential future revenues of approximately million 
the amount of this backlog that was funded at december  was approximately million and approximately million of additional funding was received by bav on january  the contract accounted for approximately and of consolidated revenues from operations during and  respectively 
the level of revenues and associated profits resulting from fee income generated by this contract varies depending on a number of factors  including the timing of ship transfers and associated support services ordered by foreign governments and economic conditions of potential customers worldwide 
the company has experienced significant quarterly and annual revenue fluctuations and anticipates that future quarterly and annual revenues will be subject to significant variations primarily due to changes in the level of activity on this contract 
see global economic conditions and political factors below for further discussion of potential impacts on future revenues associated with this contract 
contract terms specify award fee payments to bav that are determined by performance and level of contract activity 
award fees are made three times during the year and a contract modification authorizing the award fee payment is issued subsequent to the period in which the work is performed 
the company does not recognize award fee income until the contract modification authorizing the award fee is issued 
due to such timing  and to fluctuations in the level of revenues  profits as a percentage of revenues will fluctuate from period to period 
contract expirations 
vse s ordnance division had a contract with the us navy to provide program management and logistics services that expired in december vse re bid and was awarded the successor contract in its fleet maintenance division 
future work under the successor contract will be conducted by fleet maintenance 
this contract is a five year contract awarded in october  and it has the potential to generate total revenues of approximately million from through one program performed by systems engineering under the predecessor contract was not renewed under the new contract  and this work was not performed by the company during the first three months of the lapse in contract coverage for this program resulted in a loss of revenue and profit associated with the program for the company during this period 
a subsequent contract was obtained in april of and work on the program resumed 
vse s vss division had a us navy contract to provide data management and documentation  logistics support services and configuration management services to the naval air systems command 
vss was not awarded the successor contract and work on this contract effort terminated as of april  vss continued work on one of the programs associated with the expired vss contract under the above mentioned ordnance contract during and and under a delivery order issued to vss in vse parent company had a contract to provide engineering support services to the us postal service 
vse parent company was not awarded the successor contract  and work on this contract effort terminated as of january  the vss navy contract and the vse postal service contract together accounted for less than of total company revenues in and approximately of total company revenues in the loss of revenues associated with the expiration of these two contracts contributed to the decline in company revenues and pretax income in as compared to business terminations and new business start ups 
in february  vse decided to terminate operations of ttd due to declining revenues and to significant losses sustained by this division 
in  ttd experienced a revenue decline of approximately and a pretax loss of approximately million  including a loss associated with the impairment of intangible assets of thousand 
ttd will continue work on uncompleted contracts until all contractual obligations are satisfied and then cease operations 
losses associated with the cost to complete these remaining contracts have been estimated and included in the loss reported for some of ttd s technical capabilities will be transferred to other vse divisions 
revenues from ttd represented approximately of total company revenues in the loss of future revenue associated with the termination of ttd operations is not expected to be significant compared to total future vse revenue  while the elimination of ttd losses is expected to improve future vse profits 
in january  vse formed its communications and engineering division c e upon the award of a multi year rapid response support contract by the us army communications electronics command cecom 
if all options are exercised  this contract has a potential total ceiling of billion over an eight year period 
the contract is a multiple award  indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity contract  and while actual revenue estimates for the contract cannot be predicted  it is expected that this contract will contribute to future vse revenue growth 
in  vse decided to discontinue srr s ship remediation and recycling efforts at the hunters point shipyard in san francisco  california  due to the limited business opportunities associated with ship dismantlement work  due in part to an absence of any significant amount of government funding for these efforts 
profitability from the srr work was marginal for vse relative to the risk 
concurrent with the decision to cease srr operations  vse formed msd to offer government and commercial organizations quality training and product  process  and management optimization services 
in february  vcg began work for the us coast guard under a contract that has potential to generate total revenues of approximately million over five years 
vse expects revenues from msd and vcg to substantially offset the loss of revenues formerly generated by srr  with profit margins higher than the marginal profitability provided by srr 
during  revenues from msd and vcg were approximately equal to the revenues generated by srr in the net effect of these events is expected to be favorable to the company s future revenue and profitability

income from continuing operations before income taxes 



   ttd experienced significant losses during as revenues for this division decreased approximately 
costs and expenses of operating ttd did not decrease in proportion to the revenue decline  which resulted in losses 
costs and expenses of operations as a percentage of revenues in other vse divisions and subsidiaries  in the aggregate  decreased during this period due to the increase in total vse revenues while a portion of the costs and expenses of operating the company remained fixed 
the combination of these two factors resulted in total vse costs and expenses of operations as a percentage of revenues remaining substantially unchanged in as compared to costs and expenses of operations as a percentage of revenues increased slightly in as compared to the increase on a percentage basis was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenues while a portion of the costs and expenses of operating the company remained fixed 
other factors that affect the percentage of costs and expenses to revenues include the amount of work performed on the bav contract as a percentage of total revenues  the timing of contract award fees  effective project and cost management and competitive factors 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs and expenses that are not chargeable or reimbursable on the company s operating unit contracts 
as a percentage of revenues  these expenses remained substantially unchanged in and as compared to the respective prior years 
vse has not had significant borrowing requirements or interest expense in   and interest expense declined in as compared to as profits from operations were used to pay down borrowings and receivables collections times improved 
the company s business financing requirements changed slightly in as compared to due to the nature of ttd s business 
ttd performs a higher percentage of work for commercial entities and on fixed price contracts where the type of work and customer base requires billing and collection cycles that are not as favorable to the company as the cost reimbursable terms associated with the company s government contract work 
the resulting increase in bank borrowings in caused the company to incur interest expense in as compared to realizing interest income during in  the company took a loss associated with the impairment of intangible assets of thousand held by ttd 
these assets consisted of acquired contracts  proposals  and opportunities  files and documentation  rights to hire certain individuals  customer lists  trademarks  and  website rights 
the purpose of these acquired assets was to assist in the business development efforts of ttd 
the decision by vse to terminate the operations of ttd rendered these business development assets worthless 
discontinued operations on may   the company sold its cmstat subsidiary for an thousand promissory note 
the sale was a divestiture for legal and tax purposes  but was primarily dependent on the buyer s ability to repay the promissory note 
accordingly  the sale was not originally provided discontinued operations treatment under staff accounting bulletin no 
accounting for divestiture of a subsidiary or other business operation sab no 
since it did not transfer the risks of ownership 
in december  the company determined that the remaining balance under the promissory note acquired from the sale of its cmstat subsidiary was not collectible and approximately thousand was written off 
accordingly  the company s consolidated financial statements reflect the disposition as discontinued operations 
government procurement policies and practices vse s business is subject to the risks arising from domestic economic conditions and political factors that may impact the budgets and program funding of customers served through vse s contracts 
vse s revenues have historically been subject to annual fluctuations resulting from changes in the level of defense spending 
future budgetary and funding decisions by government lawmakers or defense restructuring efforts could affect the types and level of services provided by vse to its government customers and could potentially have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company s revenues depend on the ability of the company to win new contracts and on the amount of work ordered by the government under the company s existing contracts 
the company s ability to win new contracts is affected by government acquisition policies and procedures  including government procurement practices that in some years have tended toward bundling work efforts under large comprehensive omnibus management contracts 
this emphasis on large contracts presents challenges to winning new contract work  including making it more difficult for the company to qualify as a bidder  increases in the level of competition due to the award of fewer contracts  and forcing the company into competition with larger organizations that have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs 
competing for these contracts requires the company to use teams of subcontractors to be able to offer the range of technical competencies needed to do the work 
while the use of subcontractors on a large scale basis allows the company to compete for this work  profit margins on subcontract work is lower than on work performed by company personnel  thereby reducing the company s overall profit margins 
other government procurement practices that can affect the company s revenues are the use of past performance criteria that may preclude entrance into new government markets and government social programs that limit contract work to small  woman  or minority owned businesses 
additional risk factors that could potentially affect the company s results of operations are the government s right to terminate contracts for convenience  the government s right to not exercise all of the option periods on a contract  and funding delays caused by government political or administrative actions 
risk funding revenue recognized for the twelve month period ended december  is thousand 
risk funding revenue represents certain costs for work performed at risk which are not reimbursable under current contracts 
vse believes that it will receive formal contractual coverage through execution of contract documentation or amendments increasing funding for all of this risk funding revenue 
if formal contractual coverage is not received  vse is at risk of loss for any risk funding coverage not received 
global economic conditions and political factors vse s business is subject to the risks arising from global economic conditions and political factors associated with current and potential customers served through vse s contracts with the us government 
an economic slowdown in countries served under the bav contract could potentially affect sales 
the current international situation posed by potential terrorist activity and the continuing conflict in the middle east could potentially increase the political risks associated with bav contract revenues 
failure by the government of a potential foreign customer to approve and fund acquisition of us navy ships serviced under the bav contract could affect sales 
in any one year  a significant amount of the company s revenues may result from sales on the bav contract to a single foreign government 
during and  revenues associated with bav contract sales to egypt accounted for approximately and of the company s revenues  respectively 
in addition to the effect on bav contract work  international tensions can also affect work by fleet maintenance on us navy ships when deployed outside of us navy facilities and are unavailable for maintenance work during this time period 
severe adverse results arising from these global economic and political risks could potentially have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
financial condition vse s financial condition did not change materially during the company s largest asset is its accounts receivable and its largest liabilities are its accounts payable and accrued expenses 
while the company experienced revenue growth in  accounts receivable declined and cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million due to improved accounts receivable collection 
accounts payable decreased by approximately million at december  as compared to december  due primarily to the timing of subcontractor activity and the associated payments 
the increase in total stockholder s investment in resulted primarily from earnings and dividend activity and from the exercise of stock options 
the increase in total stockholder s investment in resulted primarily from earnings and dividend activity and from the sale of a portion of the company s treasury stock to a director 
the remaining treasury stock was retired 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows the company s level of net cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million during approximately million in net cash was provided by continuing operations  investing activities used approximately thousand  and financing activities used approximately thousand 
investing activities consisted of the purchase of property and equipment 
financing activities consisted of the repayment of thousand of bank loan borrowings  thousand used to pay dividends  and thousand provided by the issuance of common stock 
cash flows provided by continuing operations increased in as compared to due primarily to a decrease in accounts receivable  which was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
cash and cash equivalents declined by thousand during as a result of approximately million used in investing activities  approximately million provided by continuing operations  and approximately thousand provided by financing activities 
investing activities consisted of million used to purchase property and equipment  including investments in vse s information technology infrastructure and facilities improvements 
financing activities consisted of thousand provided by bank loan borrowing  thousand provided by the issuance of common stock and used to pay cash dividends 
cash flows provided by continuing operations decreased in as compared to due primarily to the decrease in income and an increase in ttd s accounts receivable  which was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of thousand during resulted from approximately million provided by continuing operations  approximately million used in investing activities  thousand used in financing activities  and thousand provided by discontinued operations 
significant investing activities included thousand associated with the acquisition of certain contract and marketing rights and thousand used to purchase property and equipment 
financing activities consisted primarily of thousand used to pay cash dividends 
cash dividends were declared at the rate of 
per share during  and pursuant to its bank loan agreement see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the payment of cash dividends by vse is subject to annual rate restrictions 
vse has paid cash dividends each year since sources of liquidity the company s internal sources of liquidity result primarily from operating activities  specifically from changes in the level of revenues and associated accounts receivable and accounts payable from period to period and from profitability 
significant increases or decreases in revenue and accounts receivable and accounts payable can cause significant increases or decreases in internal liquidity 
accounts receivable arise primarily from billings made by the company to the government or other government prime contractors for services rendered and generally do not present collection problems 
accounts receivable levels can also be affected by contract retainages  differences between the provisional billing rates authorized by the government compared to the costs actually incurred by the company  government delays in processing administrative paperwork for contract funding  and the timing of large materials purchases and subcontractor efforts used in performance on company s contracts 
accounts payable arise primarily from purchases of subcontractor services and materials used by the company in the performance of its contract work 
a decrease in accounts receivable due to generally faster collections contributed to an increase in internally generated cash flows during accounts payable levels can be affected by changes in the level of contract work performed by the company and by the timing of large materials purchases and subcontractor efforts used in performance on the company s contracts 
internal liquidity is also affected by the acquisition of capital assets for office and computer support  facilities improvements  and by the payment of cash dividends 
purchases of capital assets during the were approximately million lower than in the comparable period of the decrease is primarily due to information technology infrastructure and facility improvements made by vse in vse s external sources of liquidity consist of a revolving bank loan agreement that provides loan financing based on the company s accounts receivable see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the bank financing complements the internal sources of liquidity by providing increasing levels of borrowing capacity as accounts receivable levels increase 
the bank loan agreement provided loan financing up to a maximum commitment of million as of december  this loan agreement replaced a previous loan agreement that had a maximum commitment of million 
the company determined that the million commitment was adequate to cover current and future liquidity requirements 
performance of work under the bav contract has the potential to cause substantial requirements for working capital  however  management believes that the cash flows from future operations and the bank loan commitment are adequate to meet current operating cash requirements 
inflation and pricing most of the contracts performed by vse provide for estimates of future labor costs to be escalated for any option periods provided by the contracts  while the non labor costs included in such contracts are normally considered reimbursable at cost 
vse property and equipment consists principally of computer systems equipment and furniture and fixtures 
the overall impact of inflation on replacement costs of such property and equipment is expected to be insignificant 
forward looking disclosures goodwill in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
modifies the accounting rules governing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized over an arbitrary number of years 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are instead subject to a review for impairment at least annually 
the effective date for vse s implementation of sfas no 
was january  as of december   the company had approximately million of unamortized goodwill associated with its acquisition of energetics in the goodwill was being amortized prior to the adoption of sfas no 
in  the company stopped amortizing the goodwill 
as of december   the company h as not recognized any reduction to the goodwill due to the impairment rules associated with sfas no 
if at some time in the future it is determined that impairment has occurred  such impairment could potentially have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
disclosures about market risk interest rates vse s bank loan financing provides available borrowing to the company at variable interest rates 
the company has not borrowed significant amounts on the loan in recent years 
accordingly  the company does not believe that any movement in interest rates would have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows 
if vse were to significantly increase borrowings on the current loan arrangement  future interest rate changes could potentially have such a material impact 
foreign currency while a significant amount of the company s business results from the services provided by bav related to the transfer of ships to foreign governments  the bav contract payments are made by the us government in us dollars 
additionally  most funding requirements to support work performed or services purchased in foreign countries are made in us dollars  and the infrequent disbursements that are made in foreign currencies are reimbursable to bav in post conversion dollars 
foreign currency transactions of other vse divisions or subsidiaries are virtually non existent 
accordingly  the company does not believe that it is exposed to any material foreign currency risk
