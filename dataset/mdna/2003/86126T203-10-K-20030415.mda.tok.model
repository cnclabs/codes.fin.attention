table of contents part ii item liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company was out of compliance with the financial covenants of the toronto dominion credit agreement and as a result triggered the cross default provisions of all other borrowing agreements as described under borrowing agreements 
three years ago the company made a strategic decision to utilize its optics and manufacturing expertise in phase masks and fiber optic illumination to expand into specialty optical fiber and optical components 
this was based on high growth expectations for the telecommunications infrastructure in order to facilitate the rapid growth in internet traffic 
given management s expectations of the optical component industry s rapid growth and the communications industry s growing demand for advanced telecommunications equipment  the company over the following three years invested significant equity capital in plant and equipment  research and development and commercialization expenses 
however  as the original equipment manufacturers oems in the telecommunication sector continued to curtail purchases in the first half of  the company realized that while the telecom equipment market still offered long term growth potential  near term revenue opportunities for optical components would be adversely affected 
this change in market conditions required the company to significantly modify its expectations for specialty fiber and component revenue in the foreseeable future 
in may of  the company began to significantly reduce its overall operating expenses  and most importantly  its investment in research and development expenses related to optical components 
the company ceased funding two joint ventures and reduced its headcount in research and development  as well as selling and general and administration expenses 
since the company has not been immune to the difficulties of raising capital in the current equity markets  it shifted its short term goals to financing operations based upon a revised business plan 
the company leveraged its asset investments in both real estate and equipment to obtain debt financing rather than issuing additional equity capital to support its short term cash requirements 
over the past year  the company has significantly reduced its cash requirements by adjusting its operating expenses to a reduced revenue forecast 
incremental capital expenditures have been eliminated 
the company closely monitors its on going cash requirements and is prepared to implement additional cost reductions as necessary 
based upon our current forecast for  the company is pursuing various options to raise additional funds to finance operations through the end of the company can give no assurances to the timing or terms of such arrangements  assuming it is able to consummate one or more of these options 
if the company is unable to raise sufficient funds through these options by the end of the second quarter of  it will need to implement further cost reduction strategies  and the company may not have adequate capital to sustain its current operations 
financing options in process or under consideration include a new canadian bank revolving credit facility that would refinance the existing toronto dominion facility  a canadian government development loan  sale of real estate and or a private placement of equity debt securities

critical accounting policies stockeryale s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires stockeryale to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  stockeryale evaluates its estimates  including  accounts receivable  inventories  property  plant and equipment and goodwill and intangible assets 
stockeryale develops its estimates based on historical experience as well as assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
stockeryale believes the following critical policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
stkr form k 
table of contents part ii item accounts receivable the company reviews the financial condition of all new customers prior to granting credit 
after completing the credit review  the company establishes a credit line for each customer 
periodically  the company reviews the credit line for all major customers and adjusts the credit limit based upon an updated financial condition of the customer  historical sales and payment information and expected future sales 
the company has a large number of customers  therefore  material credit risk is limited to only a small number of customers 
sales to the company s largest customer accounted for of consolidated revenue in no other customer accounted for more than of revenue in the company periodically reviews the collectibility of its accounts receivable 
provisions are established for accounts that are potentially uncollectible 
determining adequate reserves for accounts receivable requires management s judgment 
conditions impacting the collectibility of the company s receivables could cause actual write offs to be materially different than the reserved balances as of december  revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance of the company s obligation is complete  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in certain limited situations  customers have the right to return products 
such rights of return have not precluded revenue recognition because the company has a long history with such returns and accordingly provides a reserve 
inventory obsolescence the company values inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company specifically evaluates historical and forecasted demand of the illumination product line to determine if the carrying value of both finished goods and raw materials is recoverable through future sales 
the company also estimates the impact of increased revenues for new products versus the potential obsolescence of older products on a case by case basis 
as a result of this analysis  the company reduces the carrying amount of inventory 
the company has not established an inventory reserve for the optical components product line since these products are primarily manufactured based upon a customer order 
actual results could be different from management s estimates and assumptions 
intangible assets the company s intangible assets consist of goodwill  which is not being amortized commencing in and beyond and amortizing intangibles  which consist of patents  trademarks and purchased patented technologies  which are being amortized over their useful lives 
all intangible assets are subject to impairment tests on a periodic basis 
note describes the impact of accounting for the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  and the annual impairment methodology that the company will employ on january st of each year in calculating the recoverability of goodwill 
this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be challenged 
amortizing intangibles are currently evaluated for impairment using the methodology set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
recoverability of these assets is assessed only when events have occurred that may give rise to an impairment 
when a potential impairment has been identified  forecasted undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the long lived assets present in that operation 
if such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts  long lived assets  including such intangibles  are written down to their respective fair values 
stkr form k 
table of contents part ii item long lived assets the company reviews the recoverability of its long lived assets  primarily property  plant and equipment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
this review is based on the company s ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from expected undiscounted future cash flows 
if an impairment is indicated  the company measures the loss based on the fair value of the asset using various valuation techniques 
if an impairment loss exists  the amount of the loss will be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
it is possible that future events or circumstances could cause these estimates to change 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of the assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
certain factors affecting future operating results statements  other than historical facts  made herein may constitute forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  which may cause actual results to differ materially from those  anticipated in such statements 
the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results include  without limitation  the company s ability to  i compete with entities that have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company  ii develop and market new products in its various business lines  iii gain sufficient market acceptance for its fiber products iv obtain financing on favorable terms or refinance indebtedness prior to maturity or v raise capital through equity or debt to fund anticipated expenditures and vi risks inherent with international operations 
in addition  general economic conditions worldwide may affect the company s results 
the company may not be able to obtain sufficient capital to fund its operating losses 
the company has historically experienced operating losses over the last several years and may continue to incur losses 
the company cannot predict the size or duration of any future losses 
these operating losses have historically been financed through debt or by the sale of equity in the company 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including its profitability  growth rate  working capital requirements  expenses associated with protection of the company s patents and other intellectual property  and costs of future research and development activities 
future operating results will depend  in part  on the company s ability to obtain and manage capital sufficient to finance its business 
to the extent that funds currently available or expected to be generated from operations are not sufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  the company will seek to obtain additional funds through bank credit facilities  equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners and from other sources 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on acceptable terms  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay or to eliminate certain expenditures  or license or sell a product line or intellectual property  or scale back or cease operations 
in addition  in the event that the company obtains any additional funding  such financing may have a substantially dilutive effect on the holders of the company s securities

table of contents part ii item the company may not accomplish its new business strategy  its photonics products may not gain sufficient market acceptance to result in the number of orders for the company to achieve profitability 
the company s business strategy is to shift away from its historical lines of businesses and direct the company s resources to develop  manufacture and market specialty optical fiber and optical sub component products for use in industrial inspection  machine vision  defense and security  utility  telecommunication and medical markets 
the company s specialty optical fiber and optical sub component products may not achieve market acceptance with commercial and industrial purchasers 
without market acceptance  the company may not receive a sufficient number of orders for its specialty optical fiber and optical sub component products to achieve profitability 
in addition  even if the company s specialty optical fiber  and optical sub component products achieve market acceptance  should these products not prove to be cost effective and reliable  or offer advantages over comparable products sold by the company s competitors  they may lose that acceptance 
the company may face delays  difficulties or unanticipated costs in expanding its sales and distribution capabilities necessary to gain market acceptance for its products 
the company is working to expand its sales  distribution and marketing capabilities for the company s specialty optical fiber  optical subcomponent and illumination products in the united states and abroad 
to market its products directly  the company must develop an effective marketing and sales force with technical expertise and a supporting distribution capability 
the company may choose or find it necessary to enter into strategic partnerships on uncertain but potentially unfavorable terms to sell  market and distribute its products 
the company has many competitors in its field and its technologies may not remain competitive 
the company participates in a rapidly evolving field in which technological developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace 
the company has many competitors in the united states and abroad  including various fiber optic component manufacturers  universities and other private and public research institutions 
the company s success depends upon its ability to develop and maintain a competitive position in the product categories and technologies on which the company focuses 
the introduction of new products incorporating new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards could make it more difficult for the company s existing products to compete in terms of pricing or functionality 
many of the company s competitors have greater capabilities  experience and financial resources than the company 
competition is intense and is expected to increase as new products enter the market and new technologies become available 
if the company fails to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields  the company may need to delay product shipments and its gross margins could be impaired 
the manufacture of the company s products involves highly complex and labor intensive processes 
if production facilities or personnel are not adequate for these demands  the company s manufacturing yields  which is the percentage of its products that meet customer specifications  could decline  resulting in product shipment delays  possible lost revenue opportunities  and impaired gross margins 
in response to changes in product specifications and customer needs  the company s manufacturing process may experience changes that could significantly reduce manufacturing yields 
the company s production yields could also be lower if the company receives or inadvertently uses defective materials from its suppliers 
the company cannot be sure that its manufacturing facilities will achieve or maintain acceptable yields in the future 
the company s customers are not obligated to buy material amounts of its products and may cancel or defer purchases on short notice 
the company s customers typically purchase its products under individual purchase orders and may cancel or defer purchases on short notice without significant penalty 
accordingly  sales in a particular period are difficult to predict 
decreases in purchases  cancellations of purchase orders or deferrals of purchases may have a material adverse effect on the company  particularly if the company does not anticipate them
