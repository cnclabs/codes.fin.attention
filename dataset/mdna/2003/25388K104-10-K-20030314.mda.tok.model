overview in  bronner slosberg humphrey co 
bsh was formed to provide direct marketing and promotion services 
in  strategic interactive group sig  an internet professional services firm  was formed to provide end to end internet business solutions to corporate clients 
between and  sig and bsh operated as two separate entities under common control 
effective january   the two entities were merged into a single entity under the bsh name following a recapitalization by a private equity investor and several existing shareholders 
bsh served as the ultimate parent of digitas llc  a delaware limited liability company that holds all business operations 
the purpose of the recapitalization was to combine the entities  realign the ownership of the combined entities with those senior employees who would most actively lead our future growth  establish an equity based incentive program to motivate current and future employees and enhance our ability to make strategic investments in our people and services 
on december   digitas inc  a delaware corporation  was formed to ultimately hold the interests of bsh including digitas llc 
effective december   bsh was merged into a newly formed massachusetts corporation bronner slosberg humphrey inc the terms company and digitas refer to digitas llc prior to december  and to digitas inc thereafter 
business operations digitas is a relationship marketing services provider offering strategy consulting  marketing agency and marketing technology infrastructure services 
we help our clients attract  retain and grow profitable customer relationships 
our revenue is generated from providing professional services to our clients 
we expect that our revenue will continue to be driven primarily by the number and scope of our client engagements 
we focus on large scale  long term  strategic relationships with a select group of blue chip clients 
we attempt to limit our concentration of credit risk by securing clients with significant assets or liquidity 
while we often enter into written agreements with our clients  such contracts are typically terminable upon to days notice 
of our total fee revenue  general motors accounted for approximately  american express accounted for approximately  and at t 
table of contents accounted for approximately 
we believe a loss of any one of these significant clients or any significant reduction in the use of our services by a major client could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our top ten clients accounted for approximately of our fee revenue 
historically  we have offered our services to clients primarily on a time and materials basis 
as our client relationships have grown  we have increasingly entered into broad contracts under which we deliver our services based on mutually agreed upon scopes of work 
these contracts generally include estimates on total fees that clients will be charged for the year 
additionally  some of our contracts include a discretionary bonus provision whereby we earn additional compensation based on our performance as evaluated by our clients 
we are typically informed of bonus revenue in the first and second quarter of the fiscal year 
most of our contracts allow us to invoice our clients on a pro rata basis for our services 
professional services costs consist of professional salaries  payroll taxes and benefits for our professional staff plus other non reimbursable costs directly attributable to servicing our clients 
in addition to the compensation of employees engaged in the delivery of professional services  professional salaries include compensation for selling and management by our senior account managers and certain executives 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of administrative and executive compensation  professional fees  non client related travel expenses  rent and office expenses 
stock based compensation consists primarily of non cash compensation arising from stock options granted to employees at exercise prices below the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock 
we have not granted or repurchased any options nor issued common stock at a price below the estimated fair value subsequent to the initial public offering in march in connection with the recapitalization in january  we recorded million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
this amount  which represented the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired  consisted of goodwill  favorable lease and assembled workforce 
assembled workforce was fully amortized as of december   accordingly  the cost and related accumulated amortization were written off 
the favorable lease is being amortized over six years 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
were applied to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in the financial statements at that date 
restructuring expenses represent charges taken to better align our cost structure with changing market conditions and decreased demand for our services and to better approximate remaining real estate obligations related to our prior restructuring estimates 
restructuring expenses include severance related to workforce reductions and related expenses and the consolidation of facilities 
costs for the consolidation of facilities are comprised of future obligations under the terms of the leases for identified excess space and asset impairment charges for fixed assets related to these spaces  less anticipated income from subleasing activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review and update these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  stock based compensation and restructuring  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
among other things  these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue pursuant to time and materials contracts is recognized as services are provided 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated project costs 
project costs are based on the direct salary and associated fringe benefits of the consultants on the engagement plus all direct expenses incurred to complete the engagement that are not reimbursed by the client 
the percentage of completion method is used since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made  based on historical experience and deliverables set in the contract 
our financial management maintains contact with project managers to discuss the status of the projects and  for fixed price engagements  financial management is updated on the budgeted costs and required resources to complete the project 
these budgets are then used to calculate revenue recognition and to estimate the anticipated income or loss on the project 
favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue and profit recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenue and profit 
if a contract was anticipated to result in a loss  provisions for the estimated loss on the contract would be made in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
certain contracts contain provisions for performance incentives 
such contingent revenue is recognized in the period in which the contingency is resolved 
we recognize revenue for services only in those situations where collection from the client is reasonably assured 
our client relationship managers and finance personnel monitor timely payments from our clients and assess any collection issues 
unbilled accounts receivable on contracts is comprised of costs incurred plus estimated earnings from revenue earned in advance of billings under the contract 
advance payments are recorded as billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts until the services are provided 
included in accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable are reimbursable costs 
we incur significant reimbursable costs  such as payments to vendors for media and production services and postage and travel related expenses  on behalf of our clients 
in accordance with the client agreements  there is no markup on reimbursable costs and the client s approval is required prior to us incurring them 
although we actively mitigate our credit risk related to these pass through expenses and our customers participate in the management of such vendor relationships  digitas is often the sole party that contracts with these vendors 
effective january   upon adoption of the emerging issues task force eitf issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  we report reimbursements received for pass through costs incurred as a component of revenue in the statement of operations 
prior periods have been reclassified to comply with the guidance in issue the effect of the accounting change was to increase revenue for the years ended december  and by million and million  respectively  with an equivalent increase in expenses for each of these periods 
this accounting change had no effect on net income  earnings per share  or cash from operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the collectibility of outstanding customer invoices is continuously assessed 
in estimating the allowance  we consider factors such as historical collections  a customer s current credit worthiness  age of the receivable balance both individually and in the aggregate  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates  requiring additional adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
goodwill effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and ceased to amortize goodwill as of that date 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests in certain circumstances  and written down when impaired 
such events or circumstances generally would have included the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the asset 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using the two step process as prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  a second step must be followed to calculate impairment 
otherwise  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  the goodwill is not considered to be impaired as of the measurement date 
we performed the initial step by considering our fair market value as determined by our publicly 
table of contents traded stock to our carrying amount 
because our stock is thinly traded  we also considered future discounted cash flows as compared to the carrying amount to assess the recoverability of the goodwill asset 
based upon these tests  we determined that the fair value exceeded the carrying amount resulting in no impairment 
if impairment had occurred  any excess of carrying value over fair value would have been recorded as a loss 
stock based compensation we apply the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board opinion apbo no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for our employee stock based compensation plans 
we provide pro forma disclosures of compensation expense under the fair value method of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  we have elected to continue to account for our stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of apbo no 
as interpreted by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 fin and present the pro forma disclosures required by sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
see discussion of stock based compensation in note to the financial statements for the pro forma effect on our net loss and loss per share had stock based compensation been determined using the fair value method  as well as for the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of options 
restructuring as part of our restructuring costs  we provide for the estimated costs of the net lease expense for office space that is no longer being utilized 
the provision is equal to the future minimum lease payments under contractual obligations offset by estimated future sublease payments 
in determining these estimates  we evaluated our potential to sublease our excess space and our ability to renegotiate various leases at more favorable terms and in some instances obtain relief through relocation of office space 
these sublease estimates  which were made in connection with our real estate advisers  are based on current and projected conditions in the real estate and economic markets in which we have excess office space 
if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than those we have projected  we may be required to record or reverse restructuring expenses associated with this excess office space 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items included in our statement of operations as a percentage of fee revenue for the periods indicated 
pass through revenue and pass through expenses have been excluded from the table to better reflect our operating results 
year ended december  fee revenue operating expenses professional services costs selling  general and administrative expenses stock based compensation amortization of intangible assets restructuring expenses total operating expenses loss from operations

despite continued uncertainty in the global economy and the continued threat of terrorist attacks  digitas results improved in as demand for our marketing and technology services stabilized at rates consistent with the third and fourth quarters of however  we determined in that an additional restructuring charge would be required primarily to reflect our revised expectations of remaining real estate obligations related to excess space initially restructured in total restructuring charges for and were million and million  respectively

revenue 
total revenue for decreased by million  or  to million from million in fee revenue for decreased by million  or  to million from million in the decrease in revenue is attributable to the decline in demand as compared to the first six months of for marketing and technology services

amortization of intangible assets for decreased by million  or  to million from million for effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
were applied to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in the financial statements at that date 
this resulted in an expense reduction of approximately million in over  as goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead is subject to testing for impairment 
we did not incur any impairment to existing intangible assets or goodwill during the year ended december   upon application of sfas no

restructuring expenses 
restructuring expenses for increased by million  or  to million from million in during  we recorded restructuring expenses totaling million  consisting of million for workforce reduction and related costs and million for the consolidation of facilities and abandonment of related leasehold improvements 
these restructuring charges were taken to align our cost structure with changing market conditions and decreased demand for our services 

table of contents we lease approximately  square feet of office space under various operating leases and have identified approximately  square feet of that space as excess space 
during  we recognized million in real estate related charges 
this represented our estimate of future obligations under the terms of the leases for the excess space less anticipated income from subleasing activities 
in determining this estimate  we evaluated our potential to sublease this excess space and our ability to renegotiate various leases at more favorable terms and in some instances obtain relief through relocation of office space 
during  we recorded restructuring expenses totaling million  consisting of million for workforce reduction and related costs and million for the consolidation of facilities and abandonment of related leasehold improvements 
these charges were taken to further align our cost structure with changing market conditions and to update estimates originally made in for current information 
we determined that we would be unable to dispose of our excess office space in boston  new york and san francisco within our original assumptions 
as a result  we recorded a restructuring expense of million to reflect the revised estimate of our expected future obligations under the terms of these leases less anticipated income from subleasing activities 
the change in estimate is related to changes in estimated future sublease rates and terms 
these sublease estimates  which were made in connection with our real estate advisers  are based on current and projected conditions in the real estate and economic markets in which we have excess office space 
in addition  we recorded restructuring expenses of million for costs related to the closure of our miami and salt lake city facilities  which are included in the  square feet of excess space 
we continue to actively pursue and evaluate our alternatives and are monitoring our restructuring accrual on a quarterly basis to reflect new developments and prevailing economic conditions in the real estate markets in which we lease office space

other income  net  consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents offset by interest expense related to notes payable for tenant allowances  interest expense on capitalized leases  and bank charges related to the company s revolving credit facility and standby letters of credit 
the decrease in other income was due primarily to the decrease in the rate of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents

table of contents risks factors and important factors that may affect future results set forth below are certain risk factors that could harm our business prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
you should carefully read the following risk factors  together with the financial statements  related notes and other information contained in this form k 
this form k contains forward looking statements that contain risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements on page one 
risks related to our business the loss of even one significant client or any significant reduction in the use of our services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations we derive a significant portion of our revenues from large scale engagements with a limited number of clients 
most of these relationships  including those with our three largest clients  are terminable by the client without penalty on to days prior written notice 
for  our three largest clients  general motors  american express and at t  collectively accounted for approximately of our fee revenue  and our largest client  general motors  accounted for approximately of fee revenue 
the loss of any major client or any significant reduction in the use of our services by a major client could significantly reduce our revenue and have a negative impact on our operating results  financial condition and reputation in our market 
our top ten clients accounted for approximately of our fee revenue 
our failure to meet our clients expectations could result in losses or negative publicity and could subject us to liability for the services we provide as clients have dedicated more money and resources to our engagements with them  their expectations have also increased 
as our client engagements become larger and more complex and are required to be completed in a shorter time frame  we face increased management challenges and greater risk of mistakes 
any failure on our part to deliver our services in accordance with our clients expectations could result in additional expenditures to correct the problem  delayed or lost client revenues  adverse client reactions and negative publicity  and claims against us 
although our client agreements often limit our liability to damages arising from our rendering of services  we cannot assure that these provisions will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability 
while we carry general liability insurance coverage  our insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
acts of war or terrorism  or related effects could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition an act of war or terrorism could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
the related effects of an act of war or terrorism  such as disruptions in air transportation  enhanced security measures and political instability in certain foreign countries may interrupt our business and that of our clients 
an act of war or terrorism may result in a significant reduction in client spending or contribute to the economic downturn and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
an economic recession or downturn in the united states or abroad may result in a reduction in our revenues and operating results our ability to succeed depends on the continued investment of our current and future clients in the services we offer 
our business has been significantly adversely impacted during the last two years by a decline in demand for our services  primarily related to the current economic down turn 
a continuation of the economic recession or downturn in the united states and abroad may cause some of our current and future clients to continue to reduce or 
table of contents eliminate their budgets for our services 
furthermore  the reduction in client budgets may intensify competition and further increase pressure for us to reduce the fees we charge our clients 
a lasting economic recession or downturn in the united states or abroad may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
actual and perceived conflicts of interest may restrict us in obtaining new clients actual and perceived conflicts of interest are inherent in our industry 
we sometimes decline to accept potential clients because of actual or perceived conflicts of interest with our existing clients or because a client insists  for whatever reason  that we not work with its competitors 
in addition  potential clients may choose not to retain us for reasons of actual or perceived conflicts of interest 
many of our clients compete in industries where only a limited number of companies gain meaningful market share 
as a result  if we decide not to perform services for a particular client s competitors  or if potential clients choose not to retain us because of actual or perceived conflicts and our client fails to capture a significant portion of its market  we may receive reduced or no future revenue in that particular industry 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results may lead to reduced prices for our stock our quarterly revenues and operating results are volatile 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
however  if our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the market price of our securities would likely decline 
factors that may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate in the future include the following variability in market demand for our services  length of the sales cycle associated with our service offerings  unanticipated variations in the size  budget  number or progress toward completion of our engagements  unanticipated termination of a major engagement  a client s decision not to proceed with an engagement we anticipated or the completion or delay during a quarter of several major client engagements  our ability to manage our operating costs  a large portion of which are fixed in advance of any particular quarter  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  our ability to manage future growth  timing and amount of client bonus payments  and costs of attracting and training skilled personnel 
some of these factors are within our control while others are outside of our control 
failure to manage our growth may impact our operating results if we succeed in expanding our business  that expansion may place increased demands on our management  operating systems  internal controls and financial and physical resources 
if not managed effectively  these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to our existing clients 
in addition  our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our future operations 
consequently  in order to manage growth effectively  we may be required to increase expenditures to expand  train and manage our employee base  improve our management  financial and information systems and controls  or make other capital expenditures 
our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting  forecasting and other process control issues presented by our growth 

table of contents if we are not successful in expanding our ability to service our clients on a worldwide basis  we may jeopardize our relationships with existing clients and limit our ability to attract new clients failure to meet client demands that their relationship marketing service providers be able to handle assignments on a worldwide basis may jeopardize our existing client relationships and limit our ability to attract new clients 
currently  we serve european markets from our office in london and can serve markets in other regions from offices in the united states 
to succeed we may also need to deepen and broaden our expertise in dealing with worldwide assignments by expanding our presence outside of the united states or by hiring more senior executives with multi national technology  marketing and customer relationship management expertise  and there is no assurance that we can attract those people or establish on a profitable basis offices outside of the united states 
we have limited experience in marketing  selling and supporting our services outside of north america and the united kingdom  and development of such skills may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate 
operations outside the united states may be unprofitable or less profitable than operations in the united states  especially due to language barriers  cultural differences  economic and political conditions in countries outside the united states  currency exchange risks  differences in terms of payment and collectibility of receivables  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  the burden and expense of complying with foreign laws and regulations and the fact that the internet infrastructure in foreign countries may be less advanced than in the united states 
we must maintain our reputation and expand our name recognition to remain competitive we believe that establishing and maintaining name recognition and a good reputation is critical to attracting and expanding our targeted client base as well as attracting and retaining qualified employees 
if our reputation is damaged or if we are unable to establish name recognition  we may become less competitive or lose our market share 
in addition  our name could be associated with any business difficulties of our clients 
as a result  the difficulties or failure of one of our clients could damage our reputation and name and make it difficult for us to compete for new business 
our business will be negatively affected if we do not keep up with rapid technological changes  evolving industry standards and changing client requirements our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and changing client needs 
accordingly  our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to meet these challenges in a timely and cost effective manner 
among the most important challenges facing us is the need to effectively use leading technologies  continue to develop our strategic and technical expertise  influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes  enhance our current service offerings  and develop new services that meet changing customer needs 
our industry is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry  if we cannot effectively compete  our revenue may decline our industry is relatively new and intensely competitive 
we expect competition to intensify even further as our industry evolves 
some of our current competitors have more clients  greater brand or name recognition and greater financial  technical  marketing and public relations resources than we do 
furthermore  there are relatively low barriers to entry into our industry 
as a result  new and unknown market entrants pose a threat to our business 
current or future competitors may also develop or offer services that are comparable or superior to ours at a lower price  which could affect our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish corporate relationships among themselves or other third parties to increase their ability to address customer needs 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or 
table of contents alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with our existing competitors or any new competitors 
potential future acquisitions could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  adversely affect our operating results and dilute shareholder value we may acquire other businesses in the future  which may complicate our management tasks 
we may need to integrate widely dispersed operations with distinct corporate cultures 
our failure to do so could result in our inability to retain the management  key personnel  employees and clients of the acquired business 
such integration efforts also may distract our management from servicing existing clients 
our failure to manage future acquisitions successfully could seriously harm our operating results 
also  acquisition costs could cause our quarterly operating results to vary significantly 
furthermore  our shareholders could be diluted if we finance the acquisitions by issuing equity securities 
we may need to raise additional capital  which may not be available to us  and which may dilute the ownership interests of current investors we may need to raise additional funds to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and to otherwise support our business and implement our strategy 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms  we may not be able to create additional market specific business units  enhance our infrastructure  hire  train and retain employees  keep up with technological advances  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
our failure to do any of these things could restrict our growth  hinder our ability to compete and seriously harm our financial condition 
additionally  if we are able to raise additional funds through equity financings  the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted 
we have a history of reported net losses and there can be no assurance that we will soon report net income we have experienced substantial net losses for the four years ended december  these losses have been attributable to charges for restructuring  stock based compensation and the amortization of intangible assets 
we expect to continue to report large charges for stock based compensation over the next two years under current accounting standards 
our anticipated revenue growth may not compensate for these charges and we may not achieve profitability during this time period 
increased government regulation of various direct marketing channels could adversely affect our business state government regulation of various direct marketing channels  such as the internet and telephone  is increasing 
new laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  could impact us directly or indirectly by preventing our clients from using certain direct marketing methods 
new laws and regulations could create limitations on our clients ability to market to targeted customers which in turn could decrease the demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance 
risks related to the securities markets our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and may result in substantial losses for investors the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
since we completed our initial public offering in march  the market price for our common stock has been as high as per share and as low as per share 
additionally  the stock market in general  and the market for 
table of contents technology related stocks in particular  has been highly volatile and has been characterized by significant decreases in market prices during  and this volatility often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to our perceived prospects  variations in our operating results and our achievement of key business targets  changes in securities analysts recommendations or earnings estimates  differences between our reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts  announcements of new contracts or service offerings by us or our competitors  market reaction to any acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors  and general economic or stock market conditions unrelated to our operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 
concentration of ownership may limit your ability to influence corporate matters as of february   our executive officers  directors and shareholders collectively owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
on february   digitas commenced a self tender offer to purchase up to  shares of digitas common stock 
the tender offer will expire on march   unless we extend it 
one of our directors and certain of our major stockholders affiliated with other of our directors advised us that they intend to tender  shares in the tender offer 
assuming no additional shares are tendered by other stockholders  and that  shares are purchased by digitas in the self tender offer from the one director and major stockholders affiliated with other of our directors who have stated their intention to tender shares  our executive officers  directors and shareholders collectively would own approximately of the outstanding common stock 
these shareholders have the power to control the election of our directors  and the approval of any other action requiring the approval of our shareholders  including any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  without the consent of these shareholders  we cannot enter into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other shareholders 
also  third parties could be discouraged from making a tender offer or bid to acquire digitas at a price per share that is above the then current market price 
risks related to legal uncertainty we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
if third parties infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks or other proprietary information  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  although we believe that our proprietary rights do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  other parties may assert infringement claims against us or claim that we have violated their intellectual property rights 
such claims  even if not true  could result in significant legal and other costs and may be a distraction to management 
if any party asserts a claim against us relating to proprietary technology or information  we may need to obtain licenses to the disputed intellectual property 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to obtain any licenses at all 
in addition  protection of intellectual property in many foreign countries is weaker and less 
table of contents reliable than in the united states so  as our business expands into foreign countries  risks associated with protecting our intellectual property will increase 
changes in government regulation of the internet and other emerging technologies could adversely affect our business to date  government regulations have not materially restricted the use of the internet and other emerging technologies by our clients in their markets 
however  the legal and regulatory environment that pertains to such technologies may change 
new state  federal and foreign laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  especially those relating to privacy  could impact us directly or indirectly by preventing our clients from delivering products or services over technology based distribution channels 
any new legislation could inhibit the increased use of the internet and emerging technologies as commercial mediums which in turn would decrease the demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance 
we may become subject to claims regarding foreign laws and regulations that could subject us to increased expenses because we plan to expand our international operations and because many of our current clients have international operations  we may be subject to the laws of foreign jurisdictions for violations of their laws 
these laws may change  or new  more restrictive laws may be enacted in the future 
international litigation is often expensive and time consuming and could distract our management s attention away from the operation of our business 
provisions of delaware law and of our charter and by laws may make a takeover more difficult provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws and in the delaware corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer  change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our management and board of directors 
public shareholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so 
in our certificate of incorporation we also have a staggered board of directors  which makes it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of the board of directors in any one year 
these anti takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public shareholders to benefit from a change in control or to change our management and board of directors
