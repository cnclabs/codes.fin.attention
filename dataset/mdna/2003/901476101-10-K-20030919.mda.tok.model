results of operations in thousands  except per share data net sales    cost of goods sold    gross profit    marketing  engineering and administrative expenses    restructuring of operations   loss earnings from operations    net sales  new orders and backlog net sales for the last three fiscal years have been relatively flat  increasing by less than one percent in and declining by less than one percent between and however  as a result of the strong euro and asian currencies versus the dollar  foreign currency exchange had a net favorable impact on sales of over million in fiscal  compared to fiscal our domestic operations experienced a decline in sales in all market segments except for propulsion  which had a very strong year  in fiscal after adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange rate changes  sales for overseas operations were slightly higher in fiscal overall  the company s three major markets  marine  transmission and industrial products  all continued to be impacted by global economic conditions 
however  the second half of the current fiscal year saw significant contributions from new product introductions  such as our high performance quickshift tm marine transmissions and the series transmissions for oilfield applications  which supplemented improving core business strength 
our continuing ability to compete successfully for defense applications was underscored by the million contract for transmission systems announced in june  augmenting recently awarded us defense contracts for other land based transmissions 
sales from this contract will first be realized in fiscal year for fiscal  the company s wholly owned distribution companies posted a improvement in sales  of which can be attributed to the favorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations versus fiscal in particular  we saw strong sales for arneson surface drives and the italian luxury yacht industry weathered the pleasure craft downturn better than any other segment 
our distribution offices in italy and the pacific rim continued to show strength in spite of weak global market conditions 
we had mixed results in our manufacturing operations in fiscal our italian operations posted another strong sales year with an increase of versus fiscal however  the majority of this increase was caused by the strengthening euro 
although our belgian operations got off to a slow start in fiscal  the second half of the year saw some recovery as we began to produce and see the effects of our new quickshift tm marine transmissions 
after adjusting for the impact of a strengthening euro in fiscal  our belgian operations posted a slight increase in sales  primarily driven by a very strong fourth quarter 
in the us  our domestic operations were faced with a number of challenges early in fiscal in the first quarter  quality problems necessitated downtime in order to segregate non conforming parts received from two of the company s vendors 
by the end of the second quarter  the disruption of production flow as a result of these vendor supplied off spec parts was normalized 
in the second quarter  the company announced restructuring actions that impacted both our us and belgian manufacturing operations see footnote r to the consolidated financial statements 
these actions were taken in an effort to streamline the company s cost structure and align its corporate workforce with market conditions 
in addition to these challenges  the company continued to be confronted with softness in many of its key markets 
however  propulsion products continued to be a strong area for the company in fiscal  increasing over versus the prior year almost half of this increase is attributable to exchange rate changes versus fiscal 
order rates for most of our products were down throughout much of the past three fiscal years  contributing along with improved deliveries  to a steady decline in backlog 
the backlog of orders scheduled for shipment during the next six months six month backlog remained relatively flat at million at the end of fiscal however  the year over year change in foreign exchange rates resulted in an approximately million increase in the backlog at june  versus june  from june to june  the six month backlog declined percent from million to million 
the year over year change in foreign exchange rates resulted in an approximately million increase in the backlog at june  versus june  with the addition of the new million transmission contract discussed above  we expect the six month backlog to grow in fiscal net sales of million in fiscal were two percent ahead of the previous fiscal year and then declined by a lesser amount to million in fiscal demand continued at a steady pace for the first part of fiscal  but eased somewhat by mid year 
shipments in fiscal followed the same pattern with favorable year to year comparisons during the first half in all forward market product lines as well as aftermarket service parts 
as fiscal progressed  we experienced softening demand for power shift transmissions and torque converters and for power take offs used in irrigation and waste recycling applications 
these declines were partially offset by the increased volume of shipments for military applications  surface drive marine propulsion units  and the continuing steady demand for marine transmissions produced overseas 
indicative of a modest recovery in certain of the company s markets  fourth quarter shipments of power take offs in fiscal were approximately equal to year ago levels 
shipments from our wholly owned distribution companies  primarily those offshore  continued to register sales gains in fiscal as recovering economies  particularly in the pacific rim  were a positive influence 
in fiscal  shipments declined as a result of weak market conditions and stronger foreign competition caused by the continuing strength of the us dollar 
at the end of fiscal  the six month backlog was million  a substantial reduction from the prior year end 
the decline was due primarily to reduced orders for marine and industrial products 
as fiscal opened  order rates generally remained weak but longer term military orders rolling into the six month window and irregular order peaks helped to stabilize the six month backlog through most of the year 
during the fourth quarter  those contracts were completed and weaker seasonal order patterns were seen 
in addition  customers continued to adjust to the shorter lead times achieved over the past two years 
as a result  the six month backlog at the end of fiscal had declined to million  percent below the prior year end 
the us dollar weakened against most currencies in fiscal year on the other hand  the us dollar strengthened against most currencies in fiscal year and maintained that edge until the final months of fiscal as a result  through most of these two fiscal years there had been increased pricing pressure from non dollar based competition  and sales from our offshore subsidiaries had been reported at lower levels when translated into us dollars 
as a result of the significantly weaker dollar in  particularly against the euro  the opposite was true in fiscal however  pricing pressure from non dollar based competition does continue 
until the fiscal drop in shipments from our belgian subsidiary  there was an offsetting favorable impact caused by higher margins realized on dollar denominated sales 
price increases  implemented selectively in each year  generated revenues about equal to the rate of inflation 
margins  costs and expenses gross profit as a percentage of sales declined in fiscal to  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
almost half of the current year deterioration can be attributed to increased pension and medical costs of nearly million  and a million impairment charge taken in the second quarter see footnote e to the consolidated financial statements 
the remaining deterioration is due to unfavorable volume and mix in the current fiscal year as well as supplier quality issues the company experienced in the first and second quarters of fiscal the latter was somewhat offset by ongoing productivity and cost improvement initiatives in our manufacturing operations 
despite early setbacks caused by the supplier quality issues and restructuring actions taken in the first half of the fiscal year  the second half of the year was much stronger 
for example  fourth quarter gross profit as a percentage of sales of compared favorably with fiscal at and at 
on july   the company announced a number of actions to address rising pension and retiree healthcare costs  meant to ensure both the future strength of our pension fund and the company s ability to remain globally competitive 
in addition to changes to both the pension and post retirement healthcare plans see footnote o to the consolidated financial statements  the company announced across the board wage reductions for corporate officers  and most domestic salaried and hourly employees 
domestic employee groups  including officers  also will forego performance bonuses in both fiscal and the k company match also has been reduced from percent to percent on the first six percent of employees contributions 
the combined effect of these actions will approximately offset projected increases for both pension and post retirement healthcare costs in fiscal despite declining production volume in fiscal  domestic manufacturing margins improved due to a more favorable product mix and the increased efficiencies mentioned below 
however  we were unable to overcome the volume induced margin declines at our principal plant in europe and the lower margins on ntc sales into its home market 
as a result  the consolidated gross margin declined by almost two percentage points in fiscal in fiscal  incremental improvements in all aspects of our manufacturing operations from on time delivery to inventory reduction and cellular layout led the way to higher gross margins than in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we provided for approximately million of inventory obsolescence and  for a marine transmission warranty program 
although the fourth quarter margin was down somewhat from the comparable period a year earlier  it was consistent with previous fiscal quarters 
marketing  engineering  and administrative me a expense remained flat in fiscal versus the prior year  in spite of an almost million increase attributable to the unfavorable exchange rate impact of the weakening dollar on our overseas operations 
this was achievable primarily as a result of ongoing cost reduction initiatives  including the restructuring actions announced in the nd quarter 
for the year  total engineering related expenses were approximately million higher than the prior year as the company continued to invest in engineering projects related to the development of new marine  industrial  surface drive and electronic control products 
this increase was more than offset by reductions in marketing and administrative expenses  even with the negative foreign exchange impact 
for fiscal  me a increased million  with approximately one half of the million increase in fiscal spending was due to the first year expenses of ntc  and the balance consisted of added marketing and engineering expenses related to a new product introduction 
in fiscal  me a was virtually unchanged from the previous year 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million in connection with the reduction of its workforce 
these actions were taken in an effort to streamline the company s cost structure and align its corporate workforce with market conditions 
the charge consists of employee termination and severance benefits for a total of employees  production employees and salaried employees 
during the company made cash payments of million 
as of june   a remaining balance in accrued liabilities of million remains 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million in connection with the reduction of its workforce and consolidation of facilities 
these actions were taken in an effort to streamline the company s cost structure and utilization of available capacity at other locations 
the charge included million in employee termination and severance benefits  million for remaining costs related to pre existing leases  million for the estimated loss on fixed assets  which were held for disposal  and million in miscellaneous costs 
approximately million of the charge for employee termination and severance benefits was classified to cost of goods sold with the remaining million charged to marketing  engineering and administrative expenses 
a total of employees were terminated  production employees and salaried employees 
in  the company made cash payments of million and also charged the million loss on fixed assets against the reserve 
as of june   the reserve had a balance of million 
in  cash payments of million were charged against the reserve and million was reversed against cost of goods sold 
in  the remaining reserve of million was reversed against administrative expenses 
the company adopted the statement of financial accounting standards board no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  at the beginning of fiscal on review  it was determined that there was no impairment in these assets 
the favorable after tax impact on earnings due to discontinuing the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was  or 
per share for the fiscal year 
interest  taxes and net earnings interest expense declined for the fourth straight year in fiscal as debt was further reduced by million excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the company continued to pay down its senior notes  which carry a significantly higher interest rate than its revolver facility 
in fiscal  debt was reduced by nearly million  resulting in a nearly million decline in interest expense versus the prior year 
the low effective tax rate in fiscal results from the benefit of domestic losses partially offset by taxes incurred on foreign earnings  the inability to utilize foreign tax credits and a reduction in statutory rates at some foreign locations 
in fiscal years and  limitations on foreign tax credit utilization  the relatively high proportion of foreign earnings and settlement of some state tax issues resulted in an unusually high tax rate 
the effective rate in fiscal was increased further by two third quarter adjustments totaling about  in fiscal  a tax incentive provided by the belgian government several years ago was disallowed by the european commission and was refunded to the government  and the united states tax provision was adjusted upward for the taxes due on an asset sale gain recorded in the prior year s third quarter 
statutory rate changes at european operations reduced taxes in by approximately  management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize deferred tax assets except for certain foreign tax credit carryforwards for which a valuation allowance has been recorded 
liquidity and capital resources the net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal totaled million versus million in the prior year 
this decline was primarily driven by the net loss experienced in the current year 
in addition  the net change in operating assets and liabilities contributed million to operating cash flow in fiscal  compared to nearly million in the prior year 
while the continued reduction of inventories contributed million to operating cash flow in both and  accounts receivable t june  were approximately million higher  adjusted for the impact of exchange rate changes  than at june  while fourth quarter sales were flat year over year  there was a significant shift from domestic to overseas sales in the current quarter 
in general  customer credit terms in both our european and asian markets are longer  partially explaining this increase 
additionally  our domestic operations had a past due balance of million from one overseas customer  of which million has been collected subsequent to year end 
the net change in accounts payable at june  compared to june  was primarily due to the timing of payments at our domestic operations at the end of fiscal from a balance sheet perspective  the net increase in accounts payable from june  to june  of just over million includes an approximately million impact of changes in foreign exchange rates year over year 
the almost million increase in deferred income taxes as of june  versus the prior year was primarily caused by a year end adjustment to the minimum pension liability adjustment of million or million net of related income taxes 
in fiscal  operating cash flows increased to million from million in fiscal with the favorable impact of inventory reductions and reduced pension contributions 
in fiscal  positive cash flows from earnings  depreciation  and working capital reductions were partially offset by taxes and by increased contributions to the company pension fund 
expenditures for capital equipment for the prior two fiscal years had been held to a level of about one half depreciation 
while the desire to conserve cash had been one consideration  we also had been more selective in adding major machine tools and had focused on our core competency manufacturing cells 
in fiscal  we increased capital spending by million compared to fiscal as the company further developed its key manufacturing cells in both our domestic and european operations 
we expect this trend to continue in fiscal the overall liquidity of the company remains strong 
we continue to reduce total borrowings  have over million of available borrowings on our million revolving loan agreement  and continue to generate enough cash from operations to meet our operating and investing needs 
working capital increased slightly to about million  and the current ratio has been unchanged at between and for the past four fiscal years 
the company s balance sheet is strong  there are no off balance sheet arrangements  and we continue to have sufficient liquidity for near term needs 
the company s existing million unsecured revolving loan agreement expires in october it is the company s intention to have a new loan agreement negotiated prior to that date 
off balance sheet arrangements the company had no off balance arrangements  guarantees or obligations except for normal open purchase orders and operating leases as of june  and obligations for operating leases are listed in the table below 
the company has obligations under non cancelable operating lease contracts and loan and senior note agreements for certain future payments 
a summary of those commitments follows in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years short term debt   revolving loan borrowing   long term debt    operating leases      the company believes the capital resources available in the form of existing cash  lines of credit see footnote i to the consolidated financial statements  and funds provided by operations will be adequate to meet anticipated capital expenditures and other foreseeable future business requirements 
other matters environmental matters the company has been involved in various stages of investigation relative to hazardous waste sites  two of which were on the united states epa national priorities list superfund sites 
the company s involvement in one of the superfund sites was settled in for approximately  the company has made a  payment in trust in settlement of its exposure related to the second superfund site and anticipates that no further payments will be required 
the excess reserve for these sites of  was reversed against cost of sales in critical accounting policies the preparation of this annual report requires management s judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
twin disc s significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements on pages through of this form 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the policies management considers most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following revenue recognition twin disc recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
while we respect the customer s right to return products that were shipped in error or do not function properly  historical experience shows those types of adjustments have been immaterial and thus no provision is made 
with respect to other revenue recognition issues  management has concluded that its policies are appropriate and in accordance with the guidance provided by securities and exchange commissions staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
accounts receivable twin disc performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based on payment history and the customer s credit worthiness as determined by review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues 
in addition  senior management reviews the accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis to determine if any receivable balances may be uncollectible 
although our accounts receivable are dispersed among a large customer base  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost has been determined by the last in  first out lifo method for the majority of the inventories located in the united states  and by the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage  forecasted production based on future orders  demand forecasts  and economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
the adjustments to the reserve are estimates that could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from the actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer demand or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
warranty twin disc engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers 
however  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the extent of the market affected by the failure and the expense involved in satisfactorily addressing the situation 
the warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for warranty costs  management takes into consideration the term of the warranty coverage  historical claim rates and costs of repair  knowledge of the type and volume of new products and economic trends 
while we believe the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable in the future could differ materially from what actually transpires 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate must be estimated 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure and assessing the realizability of temporary differences 
if it is deemed more likely than not that a temporary difference will be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodities and foreign exchange 
to reduce such risks  the company selectively uses financial instruments and other pro active management techniques 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
discussions of the company s accounting policies and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements on pages through of this form 
interest rate risk the company s earnings exposure related to adverse movements of interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to the prime and libor interest rates 
during  the company entered into a  revolving loan agreement  which expires on october  in accordance with the loan agreement  the company has the option of borrowing at the prime interest rate or libor plus an additional add on  between and  depending on the company s total funded debt to ebitda ratio 
due to the relative stability of interest rates  the company did not utilize any financial instruments at june  to manage interest rate risk exposure 
a percent increase or decrease in the applicable interest rate would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately  commodity price risk the company is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for such commodities as steel and aluminum 
due to the relative stability of these commodities  the company does not utilize commodity price hedges to manage commodity price risk exposure 
currency risk the company has exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
approximately one third of the company s revenues in the years ended june  and were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
of that total  approximately two thirds was denominated in euros with the balance composed of japanese yen and the australian and singapore dollars 
the company does not hedge the translation exposure represented by the net assets of its foreign subsidiaries 
foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of shareholders equity 
forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the currency fluctuations on significant transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
derivative financial instruments the company has written policies and procedures that place all financial instruments under the direction of the company corporate treasury and restrict derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes is prohibited 
the company uses financial instruments to manage the market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
the company primarily enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables 
these contracts are highly effective in hedging the cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates 
gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged 
the maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions 
gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period 
the primary currency to which the company was exposed in and was the euro 
at june   the company had net outstanding forward exchange contracts to purchase euros in the value of  with a weighted average maturity of days 
the fair value of the company s contracts was approximately zero at june  at june   the company had net outstanding forward exchange contracts to purchase euros in the value of  with a weighted average maturity of days 
the fair value of the company s contracts was approximately million at june
