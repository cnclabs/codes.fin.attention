item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition is based on the consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of such consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
management believes the following critical accounting policies represent the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses  which is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses  is based on management s evaluation of the level of allowance required in relation to the estimated loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and therefore regularly evaluates it for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as previous loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  current economic and real estate market conditions and the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms and estimated fair value of properties to be foreclosed 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce a different allowance for loan losses 
income taxes the company estimates its income taxes for each period for which a statement of operations is presented 
this involves estimating the company s actual current tax exposure  as well as assessing temporary differences  resulting from differing timing of recognition of expenses  income and tax credits  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgement is required in determining income tax expense  and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december   there was no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
interest income recognition on loans interest income on loans is included in income as earned based upon the unpaid principal balance of the loan 
the company s policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest  and to reverse any uncollected interest recorded on loans  when scheduled payments become contractually past due in excess of days or  in the judgement of management  the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest becomes doubtful 
general the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries for the three years ended december   should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and selected statistical information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the information is discussed on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
the financial condition and operating results of the company essentially reflect the operations of its principal subsidiary  the bank 
certain statements contained in this section constitute forward looking statements and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties described in this k under the heading forward looking statements 
outlook reflecting trends in the national economy  the company s market area generally witnessed a decline in economic growth in  and interest rate decreases in and began to compress the company s interest margin 
al though these developments have not had a materially adverse affect on the company to date  the company continues to monitor them closely as discussed herein 
the economies and real estate markets in the company s primary market areas will continue to be significant determinants of the quality of the company s assets in future periods and  thus  its results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the company believes future economic activity will depend on consumer confidence  personal consumption expenditures and business expenditures for new capital equipment 
for a description of other factors which could affect the company s financial performance and that of its common stock  see forward looking statements at the beginning of this report

total interest and dividend income decreased million  and total interest expense decreased by million from levels 
as shown in the schedule on page increased volumes of interest bearing assets were offset by lower interest rates on those assets  while the cost of increased volumes of interest bearing liabilities was offset by decreases in rates on those liabilities 
the rate on interest earning assets decreased basis points over the course of the year  from for to for  and the rate on average interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points during the same period from for to for these changes resulted in an increase in the interest rate spread of basis points and a decrease in the overall net interest margin for of basis points to  down from for the decrease in the company s margin reflects the continuing effect of the current low interest rate environment  which management believes may continue throughout and may cause further margin compression 
although the average balances of the loan portfolio increased thousand in  the average interest rate earned on the loan portfolio decreased from in to in this decrease is a result of lower interest rates and a shift in the makeup of the company s loan portfolio from fixed rate to lower yielding variable rate during the year 
this shift exacerbated the decrease in the net interest margin 
the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios have experienced a substantial shift from fixed rate to variable rate loans during since year end the company s commercial real estate portfolio  which comprises approximately of the company s loan portfolio  has shifted from approximately fixed rate to approximately variable rate 
the fixed rate commercial real estate portfolio  with a december   yield of approximately  has decreased by approximately million during  while the variable rate commercial real estate portfolio  with a december   yield of approximately  has increased by over million 
the company s commercial loan portfolio has undergone a similar shift 
the commercial loan portfolio has shifted from approximately fixed rate to approximately variable rate 
management anticipates that borrowers may seek to lock in fixed rates in the current low interest rate environment  which could cause margin compression in a rising rate environment 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market rate for a further discussion of interest rate risk management 
to mitigate the effect on interest income of this shift in the loan portfolio from fixed rate to variable rate  the company entered into a million  three year  interest rate swap early in the second quarter

the company s net interest margin increased basis points over the course of the rate on interest earning assets decreased basis points over the course of the year  from for to for  and the rate on average interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points during the same period from for to for these changes resulted in an increase in the interest rate spread of basis points 
the average interest rate earned on the loan portfolio decreased from in to in  while the average balances of loans increased million 
the company s fees on loans were flat from to the average balance of the investment portfolio decreased by million during this decrease was a function of prepayments and scheduled amortization of the portfolio  as well as sale of most of the company s portfolio of callable agency securities

this is a slight increase from million of internally classified and criticized loans at december  the sustained increase of internally classified and criticized loans over the past two years reflects continued weakness in the general economy and pockets of the company s primary markets 
management maintains an internal listing that includes these loans 
the list is reviewed and updated monthly 
the list make up is dynamic with individual loans migrating off and on the list 
some of these loans may migrate to non performing status during the course of the next twelve months 
management believes that loans rated substandard have well defined weaknesses which  if left unattended  could lead to collection problems 
the oversight process on these loans includes an active risk management approach 
a management committee reviews the status of these loans each quarter and determines or confirms the appropriate risk rating and accrual status 
the findings of this review process are instrumental in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
discussion of events affecting nonperforming assets historically  the company has worked closely with borrowers to collect obligations and pursued more vigorous collection efforts where necessary 
the company s credit department and loan workout functions provide resources to address collection strategies for nonperforming assets 
the following schedule shows the components of non performing assets as of the end of each of the previous five quarters december  september  june  march  december  in thousands nonaccrual loans      loans past due days or more and still accruing restructured loans   other real estate owned total      significant events affecting nonperforming assets are discussed below 
nonaccrual loans nonaccrual loans decreased from million at december   to million at december  during management identified thousand in loans it perceived as having certain risks  which were transferred to nonaccrual status 
these transfers were offset by continued resolution of nonaccrual accounts 
approximately thousand in loans were returned to accrual status  principal payments of approximately million were collected  and approximately thousand of charge offs further decreased the balance of nonaccrual loans 
loans past due days or more and still accruing interest the company generally places loans that become or more days past due in nonaccrual status 
if  in the opinion of management  the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest is assured  loans may continue to accrue interest and be left in this category 
included in this category are loans which have reached maturity and have not been renewed on a timely basis  for reasons other than financial capacity to pay 
balances of loans or more days past due were thousand at the end of restructured loans restructured loans increased from thousand at december   to million at december  liquid assets secure approximately thousand of the total for this category 
the increase in this category stems from the restructuring of a loan to a customer that supplies services to the telecommunications industry 
payments are current and interest income is recognized on a cash basis 
other real estate owned the company continues to aggressively market oreo 
the balance of oreo decreased from thousand at december   to thousand at december   reflecting the sale of a building partially occupied by the company 
policies and procedures related to the accrual of interest income the company normally recognizes income on earning assets on the accrual basis  which calls for the recognition of income as earned  rather than when it is collected 
the company s policy is to classify a loan days or more past due with respect to principal or interest as a nonaccruing loan  unless the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest is assured 
income accruals are suspended on all nonaccruing loans  and all previously accrued and uncollected interest is typically charged against current income 
a loan remains in nonaccruing status until the factors which suggest doubtful collectibility no longer exist  the loan is liquidated  or when the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
in those cases where a nonaccruing loan is secured by real estate  the company can  and usually will  initiate foreclosure proceedings 
the result of such action will either be to cause repayment of the loan with the proceeds of a foreclosure sale or to give the company possession of the collateral in order to manage a future resale of the real estate 
foreclosed property is recorded at the lower of its cost or estimated fair value  less any estimated costs to sell 
any cost in excess of the estimated fair value on the transfer date is charged to the allowance for loan losses  while further declines in market values are recorded as an expense in other noninterest expense in the statement of operations

allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses allowance is based on management s estimate of the amount required to reflect the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  based on circumstances and conditions known at each reporting date 
the company reviews the adequacy of the allowance at least quarterly 
factors considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance include previous loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic and real estate market conditions and their effect on the borrowers  the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms and estimated fair values of properties to be foreclosed 
the adequacy of the allowance is determined using a consistent  systematic methodology  consisting of a review of the following key elements a specific reserve for loans identified as impaired  a general reserve for the various loan portfolio classifications  the unallocated allowance for loan losses as part of the company s analysis of the specific allowance  detailed and extensive reviews are done on larger credits and problematic credits identified on the watched asset list  nonperforming asset listings and internal credit rating reports 
the company has determined that commercial and commercial real estate loans recognized by the company as nonaccrual  loans past due over days and still accruing interest  restructured troubled debt and certain internally adversely classified loans constitute the portfolio of impaired loans 
loans are evaluated for impairment by looking at the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent  or measuring the net present value of the expected future cash flows using the loan s original effective interest rate 
when the difference between the fair value of the collateral  for collateral dependent loans  or the net present value of a loan is lower than the recorded investment of the loan  the difference is reflected with a resulting specific allowance 
loans deemed impaired at december   totaled million 
as of december   the related allowance was thousand 
the general allowance is a percentage based reflection of historical loss experience and assigns a required allowance allocation by loan classification based on a fixed percentage of all outstanding loan balances 
the general allowance employs a risk rating model that grades loans based on their general characteristics of credit quality and relative risk 
for pass rated loans  appropriate allowance levels are estimated based on judgments regarding the historical loss experience  current economic trends  trends in the portfolio mix  volume and trends in delinquencies and non accruals and off balance sheet credit risk 
as of december   the related allowance was million 
for loans risk rated special mention or substandard  the allowance allocation is increased  as of december   the related allowance was million 
in addition to the specific and general components  there is an unallocated allowance that recognizes a measurement imprecision in the valuation and general components of the allowance and management s evaluation of various other conditions not measured in the specific and general components  including the following general economic and business conditions affecting the company s key lending areas  credit quality trends  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments as of december   the unallocated allowance was thousand  a slight decrease from thousand at december  losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectibility of principal is doubtful 
to the extent management determines the level of anticipated losses in the portfolio has significantly increased or diminished  the allowance is adjusted through current earnings 
overall  management believes that the allowance is maintained at an adequate level  in light of historical and current factors  to reflect the level of credit risk in the loan portfolio 
loan loss experience and nonperforming asset data are presented and discussed in relation to their impact on the adequacy of the allowance 
the following table reflects the company s loan loss experience and activity in the allowance for the past five years 
in thousands average loans outstanding      allowance beginning of year      charge off commercial  lease financing and all other loans real estate construction real estate mortgage  installment credit cards total loans charged off   recoveries commercial  lease financing and all other loans real estate construction real estate mortgage installment credit cards total recoveries   net loan recoveries charge offs  provision for possible loan losses charged to operations   allowance end of year      allowance to total loans net loan recoveries charge offs to average loans as of december   the company s allowance ratios were of nonperforming loans and of total loans 
during the company continued its practice of offsetting loan loss recoveries with a negative loan loss provision  resulting in an overall negative provision of thousand for the company will continue to take all appropriate measures to restore nonperforming assets to performing status or otherwise liquidate these assets in an orderly fashion so as to maximize their value to the company 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to complete the disposition of nonperforming assets without incurring further losses  or that the company will continue to recognize substantial recoveries such as those received during the last five years 
the level of recoveries correlates closely to historical charge offs 
as the level of historical charge offs has declined so has the amount of total annual recoveries 
related party transactions the company engages in banking transactions with certain of its directors and officers  and certain of their affiliates 
during the company obtained legal services from a firm associated with one of its directors totaling thousand 
additionally  the company purchased computer equipment and project management services totaling thousand from a firm associated with one of its directors 
the company obtains these services on terms that are the same as those that we would obtain from unaffiliated third parties 
at december   the company had loans outstanding to directors  executive officers  and associates of such persons totaling million 
it is the policy of the company to make these loan on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing for comparable lending transactions with other persons 
as of december   all loans to directors  executive officers  and certain of their affiliates were performing in accordance with their contractual terms 
effects of inflation the financial nature of the company s consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations is more clearly affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation  but inflation does affect the company because as prices increase the money supply tends to increase  the size of loans requested tends to increase  total company assets increase  and interest rates are affected by inflationary expectations 
in addition  operating expenses tend to increase without a corresponding increase in productivity 
there is no precise method  however  to measure the effects of inflation on the company s financial statements 
accordingly  any examination or analysis of the financial statements should take into consideration the possible effects of inflation

liquidity and capital resource management general liquidity  as it pertains to banking  can be defined as the ability to meet cash commitments at all times in the most economical way to satisfy loan and deposit withdrawal demand  and to meet other business opportunities that require cash 
sources of liquidity for banks include short term liquid assets  cash generated from loan repayments and amortization  borrowing  deposit generation and earnings 
the merchants bank has a number of sources of liquid funds  including million in available federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks at year end  an overnight line of credit with the federal home loan bank fhlb of million  an estimated additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb of million  and the ability to borrow approximately million through the use of repurchase agreements  collateralized by the company s investments  with certain approved counterparties 
the company s investment portfolio  which totaled million at december   is actively managed by the alco and is a strong source of cash flow for the company 
the portfolio is fairly liquid  with a weighted average life of years  and is available to be used as a source of funds  if needed 
contractual obligations the company has certain long term contractual obligations  including long term debt agreements  operating leases for branch operations  and time deposits 
the maturity schedules for these obligations are as follows one year four years less than to three to five over five in thousands one year years years years total debt maturities    operating lease payments   time deposits     commitments and off balance sheet risk the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments primarily include commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees 
such instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees written is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
the contractual amounts of these financial instruments at december   are as follows in thousands contractual amount financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk commitments to originate loans  unused lines of credit  standby letters of credit  loans sold with recourse equity commitments to low income housing limited partnerships  commitments to originate loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments to originate loans generally have expiration dates within days of the commitment 
unused lines of credit have expiration dates ranging from one to two years from the date of the commitment 
since a portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent a future cash requirement 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained by the company upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty  and an appropriate amount of real and or personal property is obtained as collateral 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 

fin no 
requires certain new disclosures and potential liability recognition for the fair value at issuance of guarantees that fall within its scope 
under fin no 
 the company does not issue any guarantees that would require liability recognition or disclosure  other than its standby letters of credit 
the bank has issued conditional commitments in the form of standby letters of credit to guarantee payment on behalf of a customer and guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
standby letters of credit generally arise in connection with lending relationships 
the credit risk involved in issuing these instruments is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers 
contingent obligations under standby letters of credit totaled approximately million at december  and represent the maximum potential future payments the bank could be required to make 
typically  these instruments have terms of months or less and expire unused  therefore  the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
each customer is evaluated individually for creditworthiness under the same underwriting standards used for commitments to extend credit and on balance sheet instruments 
bank policies governing loan collateral apply to standby letters of credit at the time of credit extension 
loan to value ratios are generally consistent with loan to value requirements for other commercial loans secured by similar types of collateral 
the fair value of the company s standby letters of credit at december  was insignificant 
equity commitments to low income housing partnerships represent funding commitments by the company to certain limited partnerships 
these partnerships were created for the purpose of acquiring  constructing and or redeveloping affordable housing projects 
the funding of these commitments is generally contingent upon substantial completion of the project and none extend beyond the fifth anniversary of substantial completion 
capital resources capital growth is essential to support deposit and asset growth and to ensure the strength and safety of the company 
net income increased the company s capital by million in  million in  and million in payment of dividends decreased the company s capital by million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
stock repurchases decreased the company s capital by million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
in addition changes in the market value of the company s available for sale investment portfolio increased capital by million in because of market value losses and the low interest rate environment  the company s pension plan was underfunded by million at december  this resulted in the establishment of a million pension liability adjustment at december  the tax effected offset to this adjustment totaled million and was recorded as a reduction in other comprehensive income  which decreased the company s capital accordingly 
the company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulatory agencies 
to be considered adequately capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must maintain minimum levels of tier leverage  tier risk based and total risk based capital 
the company was considered well capitalized by the regulators at december  the ratios for the company are set forth below in thousands amount percentage tier risk based capital  total risk based capital  tier leverage capital  in january the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program 
in january of the board of directors voted to extend the program until january under the program the company is authorized to repurchase up to  shares of its own common stock 
as of december   the company had purchased thousand shares of its own common stock on the open market under the program at an average per share price of 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management general management and the board of directors of the company are committed to sound risk management practices throughout the organization 
the company has developed and implemented a centralized risk management monitoring program 
risks associated with the company s business activities and products are identified and measured as to probability of occurrence and impact on the company low  moderate  or high  and the control or other activities in place to manage those risks are identified and assessed 
periodically  department level and senior managers re evaluate and report on the risk management processes for which they are responsible 
this documented program provides management with a comprehensive framework for monitoring the company s risk profile from a macro perspective  while also serving as a tool for assessing internal controls over financial reporting as required under the fdicia 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the exposure to a movement in interest rates  which  as described above  affects the company s net interest income 
it is the responsibility of the alco to manage interest rate risk  which arises naturally from imbalances in repricing  maturity and or cash flow characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
asset liability management is governed by policies reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the alco  chaired by the chief financial officer and composed of members of senior management  meets frequently to review and develop asset liability management strategies and tactics 
the alco is responsible for ensuring that the board of directors receives timely  accurate information regarding the company s interest rate risk position at least quarterly 
techniques used by the alco take into consideration the cash flow and repricing attributes of balance sheet and off balance sheet items and their relation to possible changes in interest rates 
the alco manages its interest rate exposure primarily by using on balance sheet strategies  generally accomplished through the management of the duration  rate sensitivity and average lives of the company s various investments  and by extending or shortening maturities of borrowed funds  as well as carefully managing and monitoring the pricing of loans and deposits 
the alco also uses off balance sheet strategies  such as interest rate caps and floors and interest rate swaps  to help minimize the company s exposure to changes in interest rates 
the alco uses an outside investment advisor to recommend investments and assist in transaction execution  and an outside alco consultant to perform rate shocks of its balance sheets and a variety of other analyses 
the investment advisor and alco consultant meet jointly with the alco and the board of directors on a quarterly basis to review current position and discuss future strategies 
the consultant s most recent review was as of november  at that time  because of the current rate environment  the consultant modified his rate shock model and modeled a basis point decrease as well as a basis point rate increase 
in addition  the consultant modeled a basis point increase with a flattening yield curve 
these types of dynamic analyses give the alco committee a more thorough understanding of how the company s balance sheet will perform in a variety of rate environments 
the company has established a target range for the change in net interest income  given a basis point change in interest rates  of zero to 
because the federal funds rate was at at december   the consultant modeled a basis point decrease and a basis point increase 
as of december   through the use of such computer models  the change in net interest income for the months ending december   from the company s expected or most likely forecast is as follows net interest rate change income sensitivity up basis points down basis points the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit run off rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will likely differ due to the varying impact of changes in the balances and mix of loans and deposits differing from those assumed  the impact of possible off balance sheet hedging strategies  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect all actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
the most significant factors affecting market risk exposure of net interest income during the year ended december  were i the shape of the us government securities and interest rate swap yield curve  ii changes in the composition of the investment portfolio  iii changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  and iv reduction of deposit interest expense 
since december  the yield curve fell significantly in both the year and year terms approximately and basis points  respectively 
as a result  projected mortgage and loan prepayments increased throughout as interest rates reached levels not seen in years 
because of historically low rates and increased loan cash inflows  effective duration estimates for loans and mortgage backed securities became much shorter in than in  thus increasing asset sensitivity 
the company s balance sheet is asset sensitive and management projects net interest income to increase if short and long interest rates move symmetrically higher 
the model used to perform the balance sheet simulation assumes a parallel shift of the yield curve over twelve months and reprices every interest bearing asset and liability on the company s balance sheet 
the model uses contractual repricing dates for variable products  contractual maturities for fixed rate products  and product specific assumptions for deposits such as freedomlynx r accounts and money market accounts which are subject to repricing based on current market conditions 
investment securities with call provisions are examined on an individual basis in each rate environment to estimate the likelihood of a call 
the model also assumes that the rate at which certain mortgage related assets prepay will vary as rates rise and fall  prepayment estimates are derived from the office of thrift supervision net portfolio value model 
the company s commercial loan and commercial real estate loan portfolio shifted from almost fixed rate to approximately variable rate over the course of to mitigate the effect on net interest income of this shift in the loan portfolio from fixed rate to variable rate  the company entered into a million  three year interest rate swap early in the second quarter  under which the company would receive a fixed interest rate and pay prime 
the swap was terminated in early october for a gain of million  which will be accreted into income through april the company has entered into interest rate cap  floor and swap contracts  from time to time  to mitigate the effects on net interest income in the event interest rates on variable rate deposits rise or rates on variable rate loans decline 
no interest rate cap or floor contracts were outstanding at december  or the company s interest rate sensitivity gap gap is pictured below 
interest rate gap analysis provides a static view of the maturity and repricing characteristics of the company s on and off balance sheet positions 
gap is defined as the difference between assets and liabilities repricing or maturing within specified periods 
an asset sensitive position positive gap indicates that there are more rate sensitive assets than rate sensitive liabilities repricing or maturing within a specified time period  which would imply a favorable impact on net interest income during periods of rising interest rates 
conversely  a liability sensitive position negative gap generally implies a favorable impact on net interest income during periods of falling interest rates 
there are certain limitations inherent in a static gap analysis 
these limitations include the fact that it is a static measurement and that it does not reflect the degrees to which interest earning assets and interest bearing deposits may respond non proportionally to changes in market interest rates 
although the alco reviews all assumptions used in the model in detail  assets and liabilities do not always have clear repricing dates  and loans and deposits may reprice earlier or later than assumed in the model 
repricing date one day over six one year to six months to to five over five in thousands months one year years years total assets loans      mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations      us treasury agency securities     other securities including securities purchased under resale agreements      other assets   total assets      liabilities and stockholders equity noninterest bearing deposits   interest bearing deposits      short term borrowings   other liabilities   long term debt    stockholders equity   total liabilities and stockholders equity      cumulative gap    gap as a of total earning assets based on historical experience and the company s internal repricing policies  it is the company s practice to present repricing of statement savings  savings deposits and free checking for life r and now account balances in the one to five year category 
the company s experience has shown that the rates on these deposits tend to be less rate sensitive than other types of deposits 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the alco 
in this capacity the alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels trends 
credit risk a network of loan officers manages credit risk  with review by the company s credit department and oversight by the company s board of directors 
the board of directors grants each loan officer the authority to originate loans on behalf of the company and establishes policies regarding loan portfolio diversification and loan officer lending limits 
the company s loan portfolio is continuously monitored for performance  creditworthiness and strength of documentation through the use of a variety of management reports and with the assistance of an external loan review firms 
credit ratings are assigned to commercial loans and are routinely reviewed 
loan officers or the loan workout function take remedial actions to assure full and timely payment of loan balances when necessary 
the company s policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest on loans when scheduled payments become contractually past due or more days and the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest becomes doubtful
