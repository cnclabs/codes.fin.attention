 goodwill and other intangible assets were approved by fasb effective june  for business combinations consummated after june  sfas no 
eliminates the pooling of interests method for business combinations and requires use of the purchase method 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill and certain other intangible assets from an amortization approach to a non amortization impairment approach 
the statement requires amortization of goodwill recorded in connection with previous business combinations to cease upon adoption of the statement by calendar year companies on january  the statement required the company to perform a transitional goodwill impairment test  using values as of the beginning of the fiscal year that sfas no 
is adopted 
the company completed the goodwill transitional impairment test in the second quarter of as a result  the company determined that a non cash charge in the amount of  net of tax  is required in connection with the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of contract marketing  inc and us import and promotions co  collectively referred to as usi 
the transition charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principles effective january   and therefore  results for the quarter ended march  have been adjusted retroactively 
the company has adopted the provisions of these statements for the acquisition of logistix effective july  and for all other acquisitions effective january  accordingly  beginning on january   the company has foregone all related goodwill amortization expense  which totaled  net of tax effect  for the year ended december  prior to implementing sfas no 
 the company reviewed all goodwill assets for impairment under the methodology of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for the long lived assets to be disposed of 
the undiscounted cash flows associated with all goodwill assets were in excess of the book value of the related goodwill assets  including usi goodwill 
therefore  no goodwill assets  including usi goodwill  were considered impaired under sfas no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 the carrying value of assets acquired  including goodwill  are reviewed annually 
during such a review the company will estimate the fair value of the reporting unit to which the assets were assigned by discounting the reporting unit s estimated future cash flows before interest 
the company will compare the discounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the acquired net assets to determine if an impairment loss has occurred 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair values 
in the fourth quarter of  the company performed the annual impairment test required by sfas no 
and determined that its goodwill was not impaired as of december  management believes the accounting estimate related to the valuation of its goodwill and other intangibles is a critical accounting estimate because significant changes in assumptions could materially affect key financial measures  including net income and goodwill 

table of contents the company s valuation method  requires it to make projections of revenue  operating expenses and working capital investment for the reporting unit over a multi year period 
additionally  management must make an estimate of its weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
changes in these projections or estimates could result in a reporting unit either passing or failing the first step in the sfas no 
impairment model  which could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded 
royalties the company enters into agreements to license intellectual properties such as trademarks  copyrights  and patents 
the agreements may call for minimum amounts of royalties to be paid in advance and throughout the term of the agreement  which are non refundable in the event that product sales fail to meet certain minimum levels 
advance royalties resulting from such transactions are stated at the lower of the amounts paid or the amounts estimated to be recoverable from future sales of the related products 
furthermore  minimum guaranteed royalty commitments are reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that amounts are recoverable based on estimates of future sales of the products under license 
a loss provision will be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations to the extent that future minimum royalty guarantee commitments are not recoverable 
estimated future sales are projected based on historical experience  including that of similar products  and anticipated advertising and marketing support by the licensor 
management believes the accounting estimate related to minimum guaranteed royalty commitments is a critical accounting estimate because changes in sales projections could materially affect key financial measures including  gross profit  net income and other assets 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
management believes the accounting estimate related to inventory allowance is a critical accounting estimate because changes in it could materially affect key financial measures including  gross profit  net income and inventories 
in addition  the valuation requires a high degree of judgment since it involves estimation of the impact resulting from both current and expected future events 
as more fully described below  valuation of the company s consumer product inventory could be impacted by changes in public and consumer preferences  demand for product  or changes in the buying patterns and inventory management of customers 
although the vast majority of the company s inventories are composed of made to order promotional product  in the consumer product segment  orders are subject to cancellation or change at any time prior to shipment since actual shipments of products ordered and order cancellation rates are affected by consumer acceptance of product lines  strength of competing products  marketing strategies of retailers and overall economic conditions 
unexpected changes in these factors could result in excess inventory in a particular product line  which would require management to make a valuation estimate on such inventory 
the company bases its production schedules for consumer products on customer orders  historical trends  results of market research and current market information 
the company ships products in accordance with delivery schedules specified by its customers  which usually request delivery within three months 
in anticipation of retail sales in the traditional holiday season in the fourth quarter  the company significantly increases its production in advance of the peak selling period  resulting in a corresponding build up of consumer product inventory levels in the first three quarters of the year 
these seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times cause risk to the company s consumer product business associated with the underproduction of popular products and the overproduction of products that do not match consumer demand 
retailers are also attempting to manage their inventories more tightly  requiring the company to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell the products to consumers 
these factors increase inventory valuation risk since the company may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times  or that the company s own inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre build products before orders are placed 
additionally  current conditions in the domestic and global economies are extremely uncertain 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate the level of growth in various parts of the economy  including the markets in which the company participates 
economic changes may affect the sales of the company s consumer products and its corresponding inventory levels  which would potentially impact the valuation of its inventory 
at the end of each quarter  management within the consumer products business segment performs a detailed review of its inventory on an item by item basis and identifies which products are believed to be obsolete or slow moving 
management then applies an allowance for inventory obsolescence to such inventory based on certain expectations  including customer and consumer demand for product and the aging of the inventory  which are impacted by the factors discussed above 
management believes that its allowance for obsolescence at december  is adequate and proper 
however  the impact resulting from the aforementioned factors could cause actual results to vary 
any incremental obsolescence charges would negatively affect the results of operations of the consumer products business segments 

table of contents cautionary statements and risk factors this section is written to be responsive to the securities and exchange commission s plain english guidelines 
in this section the words we  our  ours and us refer only to equity marketing  inc and its subsidiaries and not any other person 
set forth below and elsewhere in this form k and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are important risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results of operations  business and financial condition to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this form k 
we depend significantly on one key customer our success is largely dependent on a single customer  burger king  which accounted for approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the termination or a significant reduction by burger king of its business with us would adversely affect our business 
in december  burger king announced that the company will retain its role as burger king s primary creative and manufacturing agency of record for burger king s worldwide premium programs 
the burger king business is also subject to significant year to year variability 
for instance  the company s revenues generated by its business with burger king dropped from  in to  in then increased to  in the success of our business with burger king is also partially dependent on the overall success of the burger king system  whose sales could be negatively impacted by such factors as increased competition  a recent change in ownership and product recalls 
we rely on the continued development of new promotional programs a large portion of our revenues come from a relatively limited number of promotional programs by burger king  which promotions are in effect for only a limited period of time and generally are not repeated 
we must continually develop and sell new products and services for utilization in new promotional programs as part of burger king s annual promotions calendar 
there can be no assurance that we or our customer will be able to secure licenses for additional entertainment properties on which to base our promotional products or that  if secured  such licenses will result in successful products 
we rely on the continued development of new consumer products many consumer products are successfully marketed for only one or two years as a result of changing consumer preferences 
accordingly  our consumer products business depends on the ability to develop and market new products associated with new entertainment properties or proprietary concepts 
there can be no assurance that any new retail product line will be successful 
the cancellation or premature termination of one or more retail product lines because of our inability to renew or extend licenses which typically have terms of three years or less on favorable terms or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure licenses for additional entertainment properties on which to base our consumer products or that  if secured  such licenses will result in successful products 
the success of our products depends on the popularity of licensed materials our promotional premiums and consumer products are typically based on entertainment properties  such as characters from current motion pictures or television programs 
the success of these products depends on the popularity of the entertainment properties on which they are based 
each motion picture and television program is an individual artistic work  and its commercial success is dependent on unpredictable consumer preferences 
often we spend substantial resources in securing licenses and developing and manufacturing products prior to a release of the motion picture or television program upon which the products are based 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if the entertainment properties upon which our products are based turn out to be less popular than we anticipate 
also  delays in the release of motion pictures or television programs could result in delays or cancellations of our promotions 
our future operating results are difficult to predict we experience significant quarter to quarter variability in our revenues and net income 
the promotions business tends to include larger promotions in the summer and during the winter holiday season 
major movie and television release schedules also vary year to year  influencing the promotional schedules of our customers  as well as the particular promotions for which we are retained 
the motion picture or television characters on which the promotions business is often based may only be popular for short periods of time or not at all 
there may not be comparable popular characters or similar promotional campaigns in the future 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in this event  the trading price of our common stock may fall significantly 

table of contents our business may be impacted by adverse general economic conditions current conditions in the domestic and global economies are extremely uncertain 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate the level of growth for the economy as a whole 
it is even more difficult to estimate growth in various parts of the economy  including the markets in which we participate 
because all components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth in the markets we serve and demand for our products  the prevailing economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures even more difficult than usual to make 
adverse changes may occur as a result of softening global economies  wavering consumer confidence caused by the threat or occurrence of terrorist attacks such as those in the us on september   war  or other factors affecting economic conditions generally 
such changes may negatively affect the sales of our products  increase exposure to losses for bad debt  or increase costs associated with manufacturing and distributing these products 
our current licenses require us to pay minimum royalties sales of products under trademarks or trade or brand names licensed from others account for substantially all of our consumer products revenues 
product licenses allow us to capitalize on characters  designs  concepts and inventions owned by others or developed by toy inventors and designers 
our license agreements generally require us to make specified minimum royalty payments  even if we fail to sell a sufficient number of units to cover these amounts 
our business is subject to extensive government regulation and to potential product liability claims our business is subject to the provisions of  among other laws  the federal consumer products safety act and the federal hazardous substances act  and rules and regulations promulgated under these acts 
these statutes are administered by the consumer product safety commission cpsc which has the authority to remove from the market products that are found to be defective and present a substantial hazard or risk of serious injury or death 
the cpsc can require a manufacturer to recall  repair  or replace these products under certain circumstances 
we cannot assure you that defects in our products will not be alleged or found 
products that we develop or sell may expose us to liability from claims by users of such products for damages including  but not limited to  bodily injury or property damage 
we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage in amounts that we believe are adequate 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such coverage or obtain additional coverage on acceptable terms in the future  or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against all potential claims 
products that we develop or sell may also expose us to liability for the costs related to product recalls 
these costs can include legal expenses  advertising  collection and destruction of product  and free goods 
our product liability insurance coverage generally excludes such costs and damages resulting from product recall 
we face credit risk we regularly extend credit to several distribution companies in connection with our business with burger king 
failure by one or more distribution companies to honor their payment obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we also extend credit to several retailers in connection with our consumer products business 
the mass market retail channel has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors in recent years  causing some large retailers to experience liquidity problems 
failure by one or more of these retailers to honor their payment obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our markets are highly competitive the markets in which our businesses operate are highly competitive 
our competitors  and in many cases their parent companies  include companies which have far more extensive sales and development staffs and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against such companies 
we rely on foreign manufacturers during  approximately of our products were manufactured in china 
foreign manufacturing is subject to a number of risks  including transportation delays and interruptions  political and economic disruptions  the imposition of tariffs  quotas and other import or export controls  and changes in governmental policies 
we do not have long term contracts with our foreign manufacturers 
although we believe we could secure other third party manufacturers to produce our products  our operations would be adversely affected if we lost our relationship with any of our current foreign manufacturers 
virtually all of the raw materials used in our products are available to our contract manufacturers from numerous suppliers 
our manufacturers do not have long term supply contracts in place with their raw materials suppliers 
accordingly  we are subject to variations in the prices we pay to our manufacturers for products  depending on what they pay for their raw materials 
an increase in the cost of raw materials  such as petroleum  could result in price increases which we may not be able to fully pass on to our customers 
any such increase could negatively impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face foreign currency risk as part of our business  we enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of products with entities in foreign countries 
while the vast majority of our contracts are denominated in us dollars  significant fluctuations in the local currencies of the entities with which we transact business may adversely affect these entities abilities to fulfill their obligations under their contracts 

table of contents logistix enters into contracts denominated primarily in us dollars  british pounds sterling and euros 
although the company attempts to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of certain hedging techniques  changes in such exchange rates may result in changes in the value of the company s commitments and anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
there are risks associated with acquisitions if we are presented with appropriate opportunities  we intend to make investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions or investment 
if we buy a company  we could have difficulty in assimilating that company s personnel and operations 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
if we make other types of acquisitions  we could have difficulty in assimilating the acquired technology or products into our operations 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities and or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of our common stock is controlled by our officers and directors donald a

these stockholders  either individually or acting together  would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
we may issue preferred stock the board of directors has authority to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock  and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the potential issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company  may discourage bids for the common stock at a premium over the market price of the common stock and may adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of  the holders of common stock

in certain instances  the company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts in order to reduce exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the value of its firm commitments and certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
the company currently intends to continue to enter into such contracts to hedge against future material foreign currency exchange rate risks
