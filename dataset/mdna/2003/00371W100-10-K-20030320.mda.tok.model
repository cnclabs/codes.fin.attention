such new sources could require commitment fees  financial covenants and other conditions  taking into consideration such factors as the health of the national economy  staffing industry performance and trends  and the company s financial condition  performance and prospects 
in such event  there is no guarantee that the company would be able to secure such funding on favorable terms
