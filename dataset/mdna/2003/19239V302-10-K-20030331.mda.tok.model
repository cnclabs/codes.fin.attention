item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements about our business and operations 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements 
general overview we were formed on august  as a delaware corporation 
we began invoicing our customers for our services in april we provide our high speed on net internet access service to our customers for monthly fees 
we recognize service revenue in the month in which the service is provided 
customer cash receipts for service received in advance of revenue earned is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the service period or  in the case of installation charges  over the estimated customer life 
our april  acquisition of certain assets of psinet  inc added a new element to our operations in that in addition to our current high speed on net internet access business  we began operating a more traditional off net internet service provider business  with lower speed connections provided by leased circuits obtained from telecommunications carriers primarily local telephone companies 
as we began to serve customers  we began to incur additional elements of network operations costs  including building access agreement fees  network maintenance costs  circuit costs and transit costs 
transit costs include the costs of transporting our customers internet traffic to and from networks that compose the internet and with which we do not have a direct settlement free peering agreement 
circuit costs include the costs of connections provided by leased circuits obtained from telecommunications carriers primarily local telephone companies 
breach of cisco credit facility covenant 
we have breached the minimum revenue covenant contained in our credit facility from cisco systems capital corporation 
this default permits cisco capital  if it wishes  to accelerate and require us to pay the approximately million we owed cisco capital as of march  should cisco capital accelerate the due date of our indebtedness we would be unable to repay it 
if it accelerates the indebtedness  cisco capital could make use of its rights as a secured lender to take possession of all of our assets 
in that event we may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection 
we are currently in active discussions with cisco capital to restructure the company s debt 
merger with allied riser communications corporation and listing as a public company 
on august   we entered into an agreement to merge with allied riser communications corporation allied riser 
allied riser provided broadband data  voice and video communication services to small and medium sized businesses located in selected buildings in north america  including canada 
upon the closing of the merger on february   we issued approximately million shares  or of our common stock  on a fully diluted basis  to the existing allied riser stockholders and became a public company listed on the american stock exchange 
the merger agreement required cogent to assume the outstanding obligations of allied riser as of the closing date 
the acquisition of allied riser provided us with necessary in building networks as well as pre negotiated building access rights with building owners and real estate investment trusts across the united states and in toronto  canada 
the acquisition enabled us to accelerate our business plan and increase our footprint in the markets we serve 
acquisition of psinet assets 
on april   we closed our transaction to purchase certain assets of psinet  inc pursuant to the asset purchase agreement approved on march  by the bankruptcy court overseeing the psinet bankruptcy  we acquired certain of psinet s assets and assumed certain liabilities related to its operations in the united states for a total of million in cash 
the assets included certain of psinet s accounts receivable and certain intangible assets including settlement free peering rights  customer contracts and the psinet trade name 
assumed liabilities included certain leased circuit commitments  facilities leases  customer contractual commitments and co location arrangements 
this acquisition added a new element to our operations in that in addition to our current high speed on net internet access business  we are now operating a more traditional off net internet service provider business  with lower speed connections provided by leased circuits obtained from telecommunications carriers primarily local telephone companies 
the psinet acquisition provided us with a revenue stream from a set of products that we believe complement our core offering of mbps internet connectivity for  per month and allow us to utilize more fully our inter city network 
we plan to build on the psinet brand name  which we believe is one of the most recognizable isp names in the country 
under the psinet label  we will continue offering psinet services  including off net internet connectivity 
acquisition of fiber network solutions inc assets 
in january  we entered into an asset purchase agreement with fiber network solutions  inc fnsi 
under the agreement we acquired certain assets of fnsi in exchange for the issuance of options for  shares of our common stock and our agreement to assume certain liabilities 
the acquired assets include fnsi s customer contracts and accounts receivable 
assumed liabilities include certain capital lease and note obligations and accounts payable 
this acquisition added to our more traditional internet service provider business  using lower speed connections provided by leased circuits obtained from telecommunications carriers primarily local telephone companies 
we believe that the fnsi acquisition has provided us with a revenue stream from a set of products that complement our psinet service 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net service revenue 
net service revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ending december  the increase in net service revenue is attributable to the increase in customers purchasing our service offerings including the customers acquired in the psinet  allied riser and netrail acquisitions 
net revenue for the three months december  was million compared to million for the three months ending september  this decline primarily resulted from service cancellations from customers acquired in the psinet acquisition more than offsetting the increase in net service revenues from new installations of the company s on net product offerings 
network operations costs 
network operations costs are primarily comprised of the following elements for the year ended december   temporary leased transmission capacity incurred for certain network segments until the nationwide fiber optic intercity network was placed in service there were no such costs in  the cost of leased network equipment sites and facilities  salaries and related expenses of employees directly involved with our network activities  transit charges amounts paid to service providers as compensation for connecting to the internet  leased circuits obtained from telecommunications carriers primarily local telephone companies  building access agreement fees paid to landlords  and maintenance charges related to our nationwide fiber optic intercity network and metro rings 
the cost of network operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of leased network facilities  circuit fees commencing in april related to the psinet customers acquired  an increase in maintenance fees on our irus and network equipment  an increase in transit charges associated with an increase in network traffic  an increase in headcount  and an increase in the number of building access agreements and the related fees  including the building access agreements acquired in the february allied riser merger 
these increases are partially offset by the elimination of temporary leased transmission capacity charges in the cost of temporary leased transmission capacity was million for the year ended december  there were no such costs for the year ended december  leased transmission capacity costs were incurred until the remaining segments of our nationwide fiber optic intercity network were placed in service 
as this leased capacity of the network was replaced with our dark fiber irus  the related cost of network operations decreased and depreciation and amortization expense increased 
the cost of network operations for the years ended december  and december  includes approximately million and million  respectively  of amortization of deferred compensation 
we believe that the cost of network operations will increase as we continue to  acquire additional office building access agreements and service an increasing number of customers 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  primarily include salaries and related administrative costs 
sg a increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sg a for the years ended december  and december  includes approximately million and million  respectively  of amortization of deferred compensation 
sg a for the years ended december  and december  includes approximately million and million  respectively  of bad debt expense 
sg a expenses increased primarily from an increase in activities required to support the increase in customers and expanding operations 
we capitalize the salaries and related benefits of employees directly involved with our construction activities 
we began capitalizing these costs in july and will continue to capitalize these costs while our network is under construction 
we capitalized million of these costs for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we believe that sg a expenses will continue to increase primarily due to costs required to support our expanded operations and increase in customers 
gain on settlement of vendor litigation 
in december we reached an agreement with one of allied riser s vendors to settle the litigation brought by that vendor against allied riser 
under this settlement  allied riser agreed to make cash payments to the vendor of approximately million in in exchange  the vendor dismissed the litigation and accepted that cash payment as payment in full of amounts due to the vendor under the contracts that were the subject of the litigation 
in  we have paid million of the million settlement 
the remaining million will be paid in equal monthly installments from april to july the settlement amount was less than the amounts recorded by allied riser resulting in a gain of approximately million that was recorded in december settlement of noteholder litigation 
in january  cogent communications group  allied riser and the holders of approximately million in face value of allied riser subordinated convertible notes entered into an exchange agreement and a settlement agreement 
pursuant to the exchange agreement  the allied riser noteholders surrendered to allied riser their notes  including accrued and unpaid interest thereon  in exchange for an aggregate cash payment by allied riser in the amount of approximately million and  shares of series d preferred stock and  shares of series e preferred stock 
under the agreement the series d and series e shares have been valued at the series c per share valuation of approximately per share 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  the allied riser noteholders dismissed their litigation with prejudice and delivered to us  allied riser and certain former directors of allied riser a general release in exchange for an aggregate cash payment by allied riser of approximately million 
as of december   we have accrued the amount payable under the settlement agreement  net of the recovery under our insurance policy 
this resulted in a net expense of approximately million recorded in the transaction under the exchange agreement will result in a financial statement gain of approximately million 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  these expenses include the depreciation of the capital equipment required to support our network  and the amortization of our irus and intangible assets 
amortization expense related to intangible assets for the years ended december  and december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
there were no intangible assets in until the september  acquisition of certain assets of netrail 
depreciation expense increased because we had more capital equipment and irus in service in than in the same period in we begin to depreciate our capital assets once the related assets are placed in service 
we believe that future depreciation and amortization expense will continue to increase due to the acquisition of additional network equipment  existing equipment being placed in service  and the amortization of our capital lease irus 
interest income and expense 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  interest income relates to interest earned on our marketable securities including money market accounts  certificates of deposit and commercial paper 
the change in interest income resulted from a decrease in marketable securities and a reduction in interest rates 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in borrowings under our credit facility  an increase in the number of capital leases and the interest expense associated with the allied riser convertible subordinated notes and was partially offset by a reduction in interest rates 
interest expense includes interest charged on our vendor financing facility  capital lease agreements  the allied riser convertible subordinated notes and the amortization of deferred financing costs 
cogent began borrowing under its credit facility with cisco capital in august and had borrowed million at december  and million at december  we capitalized million of interest expense for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the reduction in capitalized interest resulted from a reduction in the dollar value of our network under construction during the period and a reduction in interest rates 
we began capitalizing interest in july and will continue to capitalize interest expense while our network is under construction 
borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at the three month libor rate  established at the beginning of each calendar quarter  plus a stated margin 
income taxes 
we recorded no income tax expense or benefit for the year ended december  or the year ended december  due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of our net operating losses and our other deferred tax assets  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax asset 
for federal and state tax purposes  our net operating loss carry forwards could be subject to certain limitations on annual utilization if certain changes in ownership were to occur as defined by federal and state tax laws 
for federal and state tax purposes  our net operating loss carry forwards acquired in the allied riser merger will be subject to certain limitations on annual utilization due to the change in ownership as defined by federal and state tax laws 
should we achieve profitability  our net deferred tax assets may be available to offset future income tax liabilities

if another supplier offers such products with material functionality or features that are not available from cisco at a comparable price  we may purchase those products from the other supplier  and such purchases will not be included in determining our compliance with cisco minimum purchase obligations 
the majority of our network equipment has been obtained from cisco 
the cisco supply agreement provides for certain discounts against the list prices for cisco equipment 
the agreement also requires us to meet certain minimum purchase requirements each year during the four year initial term of the agreement  provided that cisco is not in default under the facility

future capital requirements 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our success in increasing the number of customers using our services and the number of buildings we serve  regulatory changes  competition  technological developments  potential merger and acquisition activity and the economy s ability to recover from the recent downturn 
in order to be in a position to fund our operations through  we will need to come to a satisfactory settlement with cisco systems capital corporation with respect to our default under the credit agreement 
we anticipate that in connection with any such settlement  we will need to raise additional capital 
we are currently in negotiations with cisco capital regarding such a settlement and with certain of our preferred stockholders regarding raising additional capital 
additionally  even if we settle with cisco capital  until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations  we will continue to rely on equity financing to satisfy our cash needs 
we cannot assure you that this financing will be available on terms favorable to us or our stockholders  or at all 
insufficient funds may require us to delay or scale back the number of buildings that we serve or require us to restructure our business 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
as described elsewhere in this report  we have violated the debt covenant related to minimum net revenues for the fourth quarter of accordingly  we are in default under the facility and the outstanding balance of approximately million at march   may be accelerated by cisco capital and made immediately due and payable 
unless cisco capital agrees to waive the default  we are not entitled to additional borrowings 
we may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the remaining million par value of allied riser notes with cash  stock or assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions  either directly or through intermediaries where we believe that market conditions are favorable to do so 
such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that the outcome of any such proceedings to which we are a party will not have a material adverse effect on us 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

 recission of fasb statements nos 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections 
the statement provides reporting standards for debt extinguishments and provides accounting standards for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions 
the statement is effective for certain lease transactions occurring after may  and all other provisions of the statement shall be effective for financial statements issued on or after may  adoption of this standard did not have any impact on our financial position or the presentation of any transactions 
on july   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
previous accounting guidance was provided by emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring

we have adopted sfas no 
by including the required additional disclosures 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
such judgments affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management continuously evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  revenue allowances  long lived assets  contingencies and litigation  and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize service revenue when the services are performed  evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
service discounts and incentives related to telecommunications services are recorded as a reduction of revenue when granted 
fees billed in connection with customer installations and other upfront charges are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated customer life 
direct costs incurred for provisioning and installing a customer and sales and commission costs associated with acquiring the new customer are expensed as incurred 
when we feel that collection is not probable  we recognize an allowance against and equal to the revenue amount 
we reverse this allowance and record revenue once these amounts are paid in cash 
we establish a valuation allowance for collection of doubtful accounts and other sales credit adjustments 
valuation allowances for sales credits are established through a charge to revenue  while valuation allowances for doubtful accounts are established through a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses 
we assess the adequacy of these reserves monthly by evaluating general factors  such as the length of time individual receivables are past due  historical collection experience  the economic and competitive environment  and changes in the credit worthiness of our customers 
as considered necessary  we also assess the ability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to us and establish specific valuation allowances based on the amount we expect to collect from these customers 
we believe that our established valuation allowances were adequate as of december  and if circumstances relating to specific customers change or economic conditions worsen such that our past collection experience and assessment of the economic environment are no longer valid  our estimate of the recoverability of our trade receivables could be changed 
if this occurs  we adjust our valuation allowance in the period the new information is known 
we record assets and liabilities under capital leases at the lesser of the present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the assets under lease 
we capitalize the direct costs incurred prior to an asset being ready for service as construction in progress 
construction in progress includes costs incurred under the construction contract  interest  and the salaries and benefits of employees directly involved with construction activities 
we capitalize interest during the construction period based upon rates applicable to borrowings outstanding during the period 
we record deferred compensation for options issued with exercise prices less than the estimated fair market value of our common stock at grant date 
prior to becoming a public company  we estimated the fair market value of our common stock based upon our most recent equity transaction 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment  and intangible assets with definite useful lives to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be addressed pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 

sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  sfas no 

in accordance with implementation requirements  we implemented the provisions of sfas no 
in pursuant to sfas no 
 impairment is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long lived assets to our best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
we believe that no impairment existed under sfas no 
as of december  and in the event that there are changes in the planned use of our long lived assets or our expected future undiscounted cash flows are reduced significantly  our assessment of our ability to recover the carrying value of these assets under sfas no 
could change 
because managements best estimate of undiscounted cash flows generated from these assets exceeds their carrying value for each of the periods presented  no impairment pursuant to sfas no 
exists 
however  because of the significant difficulties confronting the telecommunications industry  management believes that currently the fair value of our long lived assets including our network assets and iru s are significantly below the amounts the company originally paid for them 
we account for our business combinations pursuant to sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

under sfas no 
we allocate the cost of an acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
intangible assets are recognized when they arise from contractual or other legal rights or if they are separable as defined by sfas no 
we determine estimated fair values using quoted market prices  when available  or the using present values determined at appropriate current interest rates 
consideration not in the form of cash is measured based upon the fair value of the consideration given 
we account for our intangible assets pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

under sfas no 
we determine the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected use of the intangible asset  contractual provisions  obsolescence and other factors 
we amortized our intangible assets on a straight line basis 
we presently have no intangible assets that are not subject to amortization 
risk factors investing in our common stock involves risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in conjunction with the other information included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus before making an investment decision 
we are in default under our credit facility with cisco systems capital corporation 
our credit facility with cisco systems capital corporation requires compliance with certain financial and operational covenants 
our net revenues as reported herein are insufficient to meet the covenant related to minimum net revenues for the fourth quarter of accordingly  we are in default under the credit facility and the outstanding balance of approximately million at march   can be accelerated by cisco capital and made immediately due and payable 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term instruments were approximately million at december   which is substantially less than the amount due under the credit facility 
should cisco capital accelerate our debt  and seek to exercise its rights as a secured creditor  we may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection 
additionally  our business plan for the fiscal year contemplated receiving an additional million of working capital under the credit facility that was to become available in million monthly increments from may until september as a result of the default  we are no longer entitled to these funds 
we do not anticipate that cisco capital will loan additional working capital to us 
moreover  we have entered into account control agreements with cisco capital on our cash and investment accounts 
these agreements provide cisco capital with a security interest in these funds and the right to assume exclusive control over all of our cash and short term investments 
cisco capital has not acted on these agreements 
however  should cisco capital enforce its rights under these arrangements  our ability to fund operations will become immediately dependent upon cisco capital s willingness to release these funds 
we are currently in negotiations with cisco capital regarding the default and related matters 
should these negotiations fail  we will be required to pursue additional strategies likely to include  reductions in operating costs  a reduction in our expansion plans  and potentially  the filing for bankruptcy protection 
we are an early stage company in an unproven industry  and if we do not grow rapidly and obtain additional capital we will not succeed 
we have a short operating history and therefore the information available to evaluate our prospects is limited 
we initiated operations in moreover  the market for our high speed internet service itself has only existed for a short period of time and is unproven 
accordingly  our prospects must be evaluated in light of the risks  expenses  and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development  particularly in a new  unproven market 
because the communications industry is capital intensive  rapidly evolving  and subject to significant economies of scale  as a relatively small organization we are at a competitive disadvantage 
the growth we must achieve to reduce that disadvantage will put a significant strain on all of our resources 
if we fail to grow rapidly  we may not be able to compete with larger  well established companies 
our future capital requirements to sustain our current operations and to achieve the economies of scale necessary for success will depend on a number of factors  including our success in increasing the number of customers and the number of buildings we serve  the expenses associated with the build out and maintenance of our network  regulatory changes  competition  technological developments  potential merger and acquisition activity  and the economy s ability to recover from the recent downturn 
additionally  our future capital requirements likely will increase if we acquire or invest in additional businesses  assets  products  and technologies 
until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations  we will continue to rely on equity financing and long term debt to meet our cash needs 
given the current condition of the financial markets  it has become very difficult to raise capital  especially for telecommunications companies like us 
there is no assurance that access to additional capital will become any easier in the future  nor can we assure you that any such financing will be available on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
additionally  our amended and restated charter contains provisions that require our preferred stockholders to approve most equity issuances by us and that give our preferred stockholders adjusted conversion ratios if we issue equity at a lower price per share than those holders paid 
insufficient funds may require us to delay or scale back the number of on net buildings 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
in addition  if our operations do not produce positive cash flow in sufficient amounts to pay our financing obligations  our future financial results and our ability to implement our business plan will be materially and adversely affected 
we have historically incurred operating losses and we expect our losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
since our formation  we have generated increasing losses and we anticipate that we will continue to incur increasing losses for the foreseeable future 
in  we had a net loss of million on no revenues  in  we had a net loss of million on revenues of million  and in  we had a net loss of million on revenue of million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
continued losses significantly greater than we anticipate may prevent us from pursuing our strategies for growth or require us to seek unplanned additional capital  and could cause us to be unable to meet our debt service obligations  capital expenditure requirements  or working capital needs 
the issuance of common stock to holders of allied riser s convertible subordinated notes due as payment in kind in lieu of cash interest may result in immediate and substantial dilution of our common stock 
the indenture governing allied riser s notes provides that we may  at our option  issue common stock to the holders of the notes as payment in kind in lieu of cash interest 
any such issuance will result in immediate dilution of our then issued and outstanding common stock  and would likely create downward pressure on the market price of our common stock 
we are leveraged and we may not be able to repay our indebtedness 
as of march   we had million of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility with cisco systems capital and million under the convertible subordinated notes due as discussed more fully in the liquidity and capital resources section of this document  we are in default under a covenant of the cisco credit facility and cisco systems capital could require us to repay the full amount of the outstanding indebtedness immediately 
we could not currently make such a repayment 
our high level of indebtedness will have consequences on our operations 
among other things  our indebtedness will limit our ability to obtain additional financing  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our market or business plan  and render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
anti dilution and conversion price adjustment provisions could make it more difficult to raise new equity capital in the future 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for us to attract new investment in the future  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
under the terms of our certificate of incorporation with respect to our series c preferred stock  for example  if we issue additional shares of capital stock at a price per share that is less than the price of the series c preferred stock  the holders of the series c preferred stock will have the right to convert their stock to common stock at the same  reduced price per share 
the issuance of the shares of common stock as payment in kind of interest on the notes will not trigger these rights 
our other series of preferred stock and our warrants issued to cisco capital have similar provisions 
in addition  the holders of the preferred stock have liquidation preferences in the event of the sale or liquidation of cogent 
such provisions may have the effect of inhibiting our ability to raise needed capital 
similarly  future sales or issuances of our common stock  warrants or other convertible securities  may depress our stock price 
such issuances may be done in connection with future financings or as part of payment in kind interest payments under the notes 
such issuances will have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders and may adversely affect our stock price 
we may not be able to efficiently manage our growth  which could harm our business 
our future largely depends on our ability to implement our business strategy and proposed expansion in order to create new business and revenue opportunities 
our results of operations will be adversely affected if we cannot fully implement our business strategy 
future expansion will place significant strains on our personnel  financial  and other resources 
the failure to efficiently manage our growth could adversely affect the quality of our services  our business  and our financial condition 
our ability to manage our growth will be particularly dependent on our ability to develop and retain an effective sales force and qualified technical and managerial personnel 
we may not be able to hire and retain sufficiently qualified personnel  particularly given our current financial condition and stock price 
we may not be able to maintain the quality of our operations  to control our costs  to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations  and to expand our internal management  technical  information  and accounting systems in order to support our desired growth 
in addition  we must perform these tasks in a timely manner  at reasonable costs  and on satisfactory terms and conditions 
failure to effectively manage our planned expansion could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition  results of operations  and on our ability to make payments on our obligations 
our expansion may involve acquiring other companies or assets 
these acquisitions could divert resources and management attention and require integration with our existing operations 
we cannot assure you that these acquisitions will be successful 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be successful or timely in developing and marketing service enhancements or new services that respond to technological change  changes in customer requirements  and emerging industry standards 
any acquisitions or investments we make could disrupt our business and be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we intend to continue to consider acquisitions of  or investments in  complementary businesses  technologies  services  or products 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks  including the diversion of management attention  difficulties in assimilating the acquired business  potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the acquired business  difficulties in transitioning key customer relationships  difficulties in transitioning key supplier relationships  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and other unanticipated costs 
these acquisitions or investments may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and assumption of liabilities  large integration and acquisition expenses  and the creation of intangible assets that may result in significant amortization expense 
any of these factors could materially harm our business or our operating results 
we will face challenges in integrating assets we may acquire and  as a result  may not realize the expected benefits of the merger and acquisition 
integrating allied riser  the assets of psinet and other acquisitions into our operations has been and continues to be a costly and complex process 
we may make similar acquisitions in the future that will also have a costly and complex integration process 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the process of integrating operations could cause the disruption of our business activities 
further  the process of integrating any new businesses or assets acquired and related uncertainties associated with the acquisition could negatively affect employee performance  satisfaction  and retention 
our business has changed with the acquisition of the psinet and fiber network solutions  inc psinet s business involves a method of operating that differs from our prior methods of operating 
since the psinet acquisition we have had to acquire and maintain connections typically t lines provided by local telephone companies from our network to the customer 
the customers we acquired through the fiber network solutions transaction also require  for the most part  such connections from local telephone companies 
we do not know if we will be able to obtain and maintain these connections in a timely and cost effective manner 
we expect that the integration and related costs will continue to be significant 
we may be unable to successfully complete or expand our network 
the construction  operation  and any upgrading of our network are significant undertakings 
administrative  technical  operational  and other problems that could arise may be more difficult to address and solve due to the significant size and complexity of the planned network 
in order for our business plan to succeed  it will be necessary to build out our network and related facilities in a manner that is timely and cost efficient 
our ability to do so  however  will be affected by a variety of factors  many of which are difficult or impossible to control  including cost increases related to completion of route segments and metropolitan rings  timely performance by our suppliers  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  and shortages of materials or skilled labor  unforeseen engineering  environmental  or geological problems  work stoppages  weather interference  and floods 
the construction of our network also requires that both we and our fiber providers obtain many local rights of way and other permits 
in some cases  we and our fiber providers must also obtain rights to use underground conduit and other rights of way and fiber capacity 
the process of obtaining these permits and rights is time consuming and burdensome 
if we or our fiber providers are unable to obtain and maintain the permits and rights of way needed to build out our network and related facilities on acceptable terms and on a timely basis  or if permits or rights of way we or our fiber providers do obtain are cancelled or not renewed  the build out of our network could be delayed 
for these reasons  we cannot assure you that the budgeted costs of our current and future projects will not be exceeded or that these projects will commence operations within the contemplated schedules  if at all 
any significant variance from the contemplated schedules or increases in the budgeted cost of our network will materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our business could suffer from a delay  reduction or interruption of deliveries from our equipment suppliers or the termination of relationships with them 
our business could suffer from a delay  reduction or interruption of deliveries from our equipment suppliers or the termination of relationships with them 
we obtain most of our optical electronic equipment from cisco systems 
we depend on wiltel communications for most of our long haul fiber network 
metromedia fiber networks  level  qwest  looking glass networks and others provide us with metropolitan dark fiber linking our national network to individual buildings 
dark fiber is the term for optical fiber that has been installed  but does not include the optical electronic terminal equipment needed to transmit or receive data  which we install  and which is provided to us by third party suppliers 
such third party suppliers are responsible for additional amounts of conduit  computers  software  switches routers  and related components that we assemble and integrate into our network 
any reduction in or interruption of deliveries from our equipment suppliers  especially cisco systems  metromedia fiber networks  level  or wiltel communications could delay our plans to complete our network and install in building networks  impair our ability to acquire or retain customers  and harm our business generally 
historically  the metropolitan dark fiber industry has encountered delays in delivering its products 
our suppliers have encountered this and  as a result  we have experienced increasing delays in obtaining metropolitan dark fiber from them 
this has resulted in  and could continue to result in  a delay in extending our network to end user locations and our ability to service customers 
we may construct certain portions ourselves in order to complete our business plan on a timely basis 
in addition  the price of the equipment and other supplies we purchase may substantially increase over time  increasing the costs we pay in the future 
it could take a significant period of time to establish relationships with alternative suppliers for each of our technologies and substitute their technologies into our networks 
if any of these relationships are terminated or a supplier fails to provide reliable services or equipment and we are unable to reach suitable alternative arrangements quickly  we may experience significant delays and additional costs 
if that happens  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our business could suffer delays and problems due to the actions of network providers on whom we are partially dependent 
with the acquisition of psinet assets we began to provide services over networks provided and controlled by others  such as local telephone companies 
in the past we have acquired dark fiber from providers and installed our own equipment to operate our network 
many former psinet and fiber network solutions customers  who are now our customers  as well as new customers our sales force generates  are connected to our network by means of communications lines typically t lines that are provided as services by local telephone companies and others  and we plan to add new customers to our network using such services 
we may experience problems with the installation  maintenance  and pricing of these t lines and other communications links that are beyond our ability to control or to remedy directly 
our rights to the use of the dark fiber that make up our network may be affected by the financial health of our fiber providers 
except for some last mile lateral connections that we have constructed  we do not have title to the dark fiber that makes up the foundation of our network 
our interests in the dark fiber that makes up our network take the form of long term leases or indefeasible right of use agreements  known as irus 
a bankruptcy or financial collapse of one of our fiber providers could result in a loss of our rights under our long term lease agreements or irus with such provider  which in turn could have a negative impact on the integrity of our network and on our results of operations 
if we lose rights under our iru agreements  we may be required to expend additional funds for maintenance of the fiber  directly fund right of way obligations  or even purchase replacement fiber from another provider if it exists 
there may be geographic regions in which alternate providers do not exist 
this could require us to suspend operations to some customers or construct our own fiber connections to those customers 
there has been increasing financial pressure on some of our fiber providers as part of the overall weakening of the telecommunications market over the past to months 
our largest supplier of our metropolitan fiber networks  metromedia fiber networks  filed for bankruptcy and has yet to emerge 
the parent of the provider of our national backbone fiber rings filed for bankruptcy and emerged in october this will impact our operations chiefly by decreasing our ability to add new metropolitan fiber rings and our ability to add new buildings to existing rings 
another supplier of metropolitan fiber  acsi network technologies  inc  also filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
in these or other cases of bankruptcy or financial collapse  our rights under our dark fiber agreements remain unclear  although to date there has been no interruption of service 
in particular  to our knowledge  the rights of the holder of an iru in strands of dark fiber have never been addressed by the judiciary at the state or federal level in bankruptcy 
we often are limited in choices for metropolitan fiber suppliers 
in some of our target markets there is only one established carrier available to provide the necessary connection 
this increases our costs and makes it difficult to obtain sufficient dark fiber 
sufficient dark fiber may not be readily available from third parties at commercially reasonable rates  if at all 
our failure to obtain sufficient dark fiber could result in an inability to provide service in certain buildings and service interruptions  which could in time lead to loss of customers and damage to our reputation 
our business plan cannot succeed unless we continue to obtain and maintain license agreements with building owners and managers 
our business depends upon our ability to install in building networks 
this requires us to enter into access agreements with building owners or managers allowing us to install our in building networks and provide our services in the buildings 
these agreements typically have terms of five to ten years  with limited renewal rights 
we expect to need to enter into additional access agreements for the foreseeable future  and may need to amend some of the current agreements to allow us to offer all of the services contemplated by our current business plan 
the failure of building owners or managers to grant  amend  or renew access rights on acceptable terms  or any deterioration in our existing relationships with building owners or managers  could harm our marketing efforts and could substantially reduce our potential customer base 
current federal and state regulations do not require building owners to make space available to us  or to do so on terms that are reasonable or nondiscriminatory 
while the fcc has adopted regulations that prohibit carriers under its jurisdiction from entering into exclusive arrangements with owners of multi tenant commercial office buildings  these regulations do not require building owners to offer us access to their buildings 
building owners or managers may decide not to permit us to install our networks in their buildings or may elect not to renew or amend our access agreements 
the failure to obtain or maintain these agreements would reduce our revenues and we might not recover our infrastructure costs 
we will need to obtain or construct additional building laterals to connect buildings to our network 
in order to connect a building to our high speed cogent network  we must obtain or construct lateral fiber extensions from our metropolitan ring to the building to which we intend to provide our on net internet service 
to date  we have relied largely on third parties for lateral connections 
while we intend to continue using third parties for lateral connections in the future  we also have constructed or funded laterals on our own or in ventures with third parties 
the availability of such lateral connections from third parties is dependent on many factors  including but not limited to the financial health of those lateral providers  including metromedia fiber networks  and their willingness to offer laterals to us on acceptable terms and conditions  ability of those lateral providers to construct  deliver  and connect such laterals  which depends  in part  on their ability to obtain and maintain the necessary franchise rights and permits to supply laterals  construct such laterals in a timely and correct manner  and splice such laterals into our network rings to enable optical connections  and willingness of the various municipalities in which such laterals are located to allow the construction of fiber laterals 
our ability to construct or fund some laterals on our own is also dependent on these factors 
if any of these factors are not fulfilled  we may not be able to obtain some of the desired lateral connections to buildings  which could substantially reduce our customer base and our ability to fulfill our business plan 
we must make capital expenditures before generating revenues  which may prove insufficient to justify those expenditures 
prior to generating revenues  we must incur significant initial capital expenditures 
our expenditures will vary depending on  among other things  whether we encounter any construction related difficulties or difficulties in acquiring rights of way or other permits 
after the initial installation of our network  our capital expenditures for  among other things  equipment and wiring within buildings and fiber optic connections to buildings continue to grow based on the extent to which we add customers within a building 
we may not be able to recoup all of our expenditures 
our success depends on growth in the use of the internet  and on the willingness of customers to buy our internet service 
our future success depends in large part on growth in the number of people who use the internet as well as growth in the number of ways people use the internet 
specifically  we are dependent on the growth of the demand for high speed internet service  which is unproven and may grow less than the demand for communications services generally  or not at all 
furthermore  our own growth rate may not match the growth rate of the high speed internet service market as a whole 
our success also depends on rapid growth in sales of our particular internet services offerings 
this growth depends  in part  on customers trusting us to deliver the services in a timely and efficient manner  and that we will continue to operate for at least as long as the life of any contract between the two of us 
this trust may be difficult to establish because there has been a substantial downturn in the telecommunications industry  leading to many bankruptcies and closures of other internet service providers 
some of these closures required the customers of the closing internet service provider to find alternative providers on very short notice 
in light of these developments  there may be an increasing desire on the part of internet service customers to only do business with telecommunications providers who have a long operating history and are amongst the biggest providers in the industry 
our short operating history and small size could put us at a disadvantage in competing with such established providers 
impairment of our intellectual property rights and our alleged infringement on other companies intellectual property rights could harm our business 
we are aware of several other companies in our and other industries that use the word cogent in their corporate names 
one company has informed us that it believes our use of the name cogent infringes on their intellectual property rights in that name 
if such a challenge is successful  we could be required to change our name and lose the goodwill associated with the cogent name in our markets 
the sector in which we operate is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
we face competition from many communications providers with significantly greater financial resources  well established brand names  larger customer bases  and diverse strategic plans and technologies 
many of these competitors have longer operating histories and more established relationships in the industry than we do 
intense competition has led to declining prices and margins for many communications services 
we expect this trend to continue as competition intensifies in the future 
we expect significant competition from traditional and new communications companies  including local  long distance  cable modem  internet  digital subscriber line  fixed and mobile wireless  and satellite data service providers  some of which are described in more detail below 
if these potential competitors successfully focus on our market  we may face intense competition harmful to our business 
in addition  we may also face severe price competition for building access rights  which could result in higher sales and marketing expenses and lower profit margins 
incumbent carriers 
in each market we serve  we face  and expect to continue to face  significant competition from the incumbent carriers  which currently dominate the local telecommunications markets 
we compete with the incumbent local exchange carriers on the basis of product offerings  quality  capacity and reliability of network facilities  state of the art technology  price  route diversity  ease of ordering and customer service 
however  the incumbent carriers have long standing relationships with their customers and provide those customers with various transmission and switching services that we do not currently offer 
because our fiber optic networks have been recently installed compared to those of the incumbent carriers  our state of the art technology may provide us with cost  capacity  and service quality advantages over some existing incumbent carrier networks  however  our network may not support the breadth of products supported by these legacy networks 
in building competitors 
some competitors  such as cypress communications  xo communications  yipes  intellispace  and eureka networks  are attempting to gain access to office buildings in our target markets 
some of these competitors are seeking to develop preferential relationships with building owners 
to the extent these competitors are successful  we may face difficulties in building our networks and marketing our services within some of our target buildings 
our agreements to use utility shaft space riser facilities within buildings are generally not exclusive 
an owner of any of the buildings in which we have rights to install a network could also give similar rights to one of our competitors 
certain competitors already have rights to install networks in some of the buildings in which we have rights to install our networks 
it will take a substantial amount of time to build networks in all the buildings in which we intend to exercise our rights under our license agreements and master license agreements 
each building in which we do not build a network is particularly vulnerable to competitors 
it is not clear whether it will be profitable for two or more different companies to operate networks within the same building 
therefore  it is critical that we build our networks in additional buildings quickly 
once we have done so  if a competitor installs a network in the same building  there will likely be substantial price competition 
local telephone companies 
incumbent local telephone companies  including regional bell operating companies such as verizon  sbc  qwest and bellsouth  have several competitive strengths which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
these competitive strengths include an established brand name and reputation and significant capital to rapidly deploy or leverage existing communications equipment and broadband networks 
competitive local telephone companies often market their services to tenants of buildings within our target markets and selectively construct in building facilities 
historically incumbent local telephone companies have not been required to compensate building owners for access and distribution rights within a targeted building 
long distance companies 
many of the leading long distance companies  such as at t  mci worldcom and sprint  could begin to build their own in building voice and data networks 
the newer national long distance carriers  such as qwest  are building and managing high speed fiber based national voice and data networks  partnering with internet service providers  and may extend their networks by installing in building facilities and equipment 
competitive local telephone companies 
competitive local telephone companies often have broadband inter building connections  market their services to tenants of large and medium sized buildings  and selectively build in building facilities 
fixed wireless service providers 
fixed wireless service providers  such as mci worldcom  xo communications  first avenue networks  at t  sprint  terabeam  teligent and winstar communications  provide high speed communications services to customers using microwave or other facilities or satellite earth stations on building rooftops 
internet service providers 
internet service providers  such as at t worldnet  earthlink  prodigy  the uunet subsidiary of mci worldcom  level  sprint and verio  provide traditional and high speed internet access to residential and business customers  generally using the existing communications infrastructure 
digital subscriber line companies and or their internet service provider customers  such as at t and covad  typically provide broadband internet access using digital subscriber line technology  which enables data traffic to be transmitted over standard copper telephone lines at much higher speeds than these lines would normally allow 
providers  such as america online  microsoft network  prodigy  united online and earthlink  generally target the residential market and provide internet connectivity  ease of use and a stable environment for modem connections 
cable based service providers 
cable based service providers  such as roadrunner  rcn communications  comcast  cox  aol time warner and charter communications use cable television distribution systems to provide high capacity internet access 
other high speed internet service providers 
we may also lose potential customers to other high speed internet service 
these providers  such as yipes and onfiber  and are often characterized as ethernet metropolitan access networks 
they have targeted a similar customer base and have business strategies that have elements that parallel ours 
some of our competitors are in bankruptcy or may soon emerge from bankruptcy 
because the bankruptcy process allows for the discharge of debts and rejection of certain obligations the competitors may have pricing flexibility and a lower cost structure with which we will find it difficult to compete 
our failure to acquire  integrate  and operate new technologies could harm our competitive position 
the telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancement and the introduction of new products and services 
we do not possess significant intellectual property rights with respect to the technologies we use  and we are dependent on third parties for the development of and access to new technology 
in addition  we own the equipment we use to provide our services and we will have long term leases or indefeasible rights of use attached to the fiber optic networks that will constitute our network 
therefore  technological changes that render our equipment out of date  less efficient  or more expensive to operate than newer equipment could cause us to incur substantial increases in capital expenditures to upgrade or replace such equipment 
additionally  there currently are other technologies that provide more capacity and speed than dial up connections and can be used instead of our high speed data services  including digital subscriber line technology  cable modems  wireless technology  and integrated services digital networks 
furthermore  these technologies may be improved and other new technologies may develop that provide more capacity and speed than the broadband data technology we typically employ 
our connection to the internet requires us to obtain and maintain relationships with other providers 
the internet is composed of various public and private network providers who operate their own networks and interconnect them at public and private interconnection points 
our network is one such network 
in order to obtain internet connectivity for our network  we must obtain and maintain relationships with other such providers and incur the necessary capital costs to locate our equipment and connect our network at these various interconnection points 
some of these connections are made through the purchasing of transit capacity at negotiated rates  which gives us access to a provider and other networks to which that provider is connected 
in addition  in some instances we have minimum and maximum volume commitments to receive the negotiated rates 
if we fail to meet the minimum  or exceed the maximum  volume commitments  our rates and costs may rise 
another source of connection to the internet is peering arrangements 
by entering into what are known as settlement free peering arrangements  providers agree to exchange traffic between their respective networks without charging each other 
our establishment and maintenance of peering relationships is necessary to avoid the higher costs of transit capacity and in order to maintain high network performance capacity 
our business plan depends on our ability to avoid transit costs in the future as our network expands 
in that regard  we are attempting a number of initiatives to lower our transit costs 
we are seeking more settlement free peering arrangements 
we expect that these initiatives will enable us to reduce our transit costs but there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful 
peering relationships are not subject to regulation  and may change in terms and conditions 
some internet service providers have outbound versus inbound ratio requirements in order to establish or maintain peering relationships 
at the current time our customer base has more content providers web hosting  internet radio  etc  than retail users which may lead to more outbound traffic than inbound and thus unacceptable ratios to these providers 
if that happens we may be forced to send more traffic either over transit or via paid settlements 
if we are not able to maintain and increase our peering relationships  we may not be able to provide our customers with high performance and affordable services which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
network failure or delays and errors in transmissions expose us to potential liability 
our network uses a collection of communications equipment  software  operating protocols  and proprietary applications for the high speed transportation of large quantities of data among multiple locations 
given the complexity of our network  it may be possible that data will be lost or distorted 
delays in data delivery may cause significant losses to a customer using our network 
our network may also contain undetected design faults and software bugs that  despite our testing  may not be discovered in time to prevent harm to our network 
the failure of any equipment or facility on the network could result in the interruption of customer service until we effect necessary repairs or install replacement equipment 
network failures  delays  and errors could also result from natural disasters  power losses  security breaches  and computer viruses 
in addition  some of our customers are  at least initially  only served by partial fiber rings  increasing the risk of service interruption 
with the acquisition of psinet assets we have become partially dependent on the networks of other providers such as local telephone companies 
network failures  faults  or errors could cause delays or service interruptions  expose us to customer liability  or require expensive modifications that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as an internet access provider  we may be vulnerable to unauthorized access or we may incur liability for information disseminated through our network 
our networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses  and other disruptive problems 
addressing the effects of computer viruses and alleviating other security problems may require interruptions  incurrence of costs and delays  or cessation of service to our customers 
unauthorized access could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems or those of our customers  for which we could possibly be held liable 
the law relating to the liability of internet access providers and online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their networks is unsettled 
as the law in this area develops  the potential imposition of liability upon us for information carried on and disseminated through our network could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability  which may require the expenditure of substantial resources or the discontinuation of certain products or service offerings 
any costs that are incurred as a result of such measures or the imposition of liability could harm our business 
legislation and government regulation could adversely affect us 
we believe the enhanced services we provide today are not subject to substantial regulation by the fcc or the state public utilities commissions 
federal and state commissions exercise jurisdiction over providers of basic telecommunications services 
however  enhanced service providers are currently exempt from federal and state regulations governing providers of basic telecommunications services  including the obligation to pay access charges and contribute to the universal service fund 
changes in regulation or new legislation may increase the regulation of our current enhanced services 
such changes in the regulatory environment are difficult for us to predict and could affect our operating results by increasing competition  decreasing revenue  increasing costs  or impairing our ability to offer services 
if we decide to provide voice and other basic telecommunications services in the united states we may be unable to successfully respond to regulatory changes 
we will become subject to regulation by the fcc and state agencies in the event we decide to offer non enhanced voice and other basic telecommunications services and may become subject to regulation if we offer voice services over the internet 
complying with these regulatory requirements may be costly 
regulation of access to office buildings could negatively affect our business 
fcc rules prohibit common carriers from entering into contracts that restrict the right of commercial multi unit property owners to permit any other common carrier to access and serve the property s commercial tenants 
while we believe that this rule does not apply to us  we compete against common carriers in providing some of our services and this rule could make it easier for an increased number of such common carrier competitors to gain access to buildings where we provide service 
the fcc declined to adopt rules mandating that commercial multi unit property owners permit access to all carriers on a nondiscriminatory basis  but it is continuing to consider this and other issues in future phases of this proceeding 
bills have also been introduced in congress regarding the same topic but congress has yet to act 
some of the issues being considered in these developments include requiring real estate owners to provide utility shafts access to telecommunications carriers  and requiring some telecommunications providers to provide access to other telecommunications providers 
we do not know whether or in what form these proposals will be adopted 
deregulation of the provision of high speed internet access by incumbent local exchange carriers could result in increased competition and negatively affect our business 
the fcc is currently considering whether to reduce its regulation of the delivery of high speed internet access by incumbent local exchange carriers including the regional bell operating companies held by verizon  sbc  qwest and bellsouth 
while we do not know if or to what extent such a reduction will occur  such reduced regulation could negatively affect our business by enhancing the competitive position of the incumbent local exchange carriers 
in february  the fcc announced that it was eliminating some of its rules that made it easier for competitive entrants to gain access to the incumbent local exchange carrier s network for the purpose of providing high speed access to the internet 
we do not expect these rule changes to have a material impact on our ability to provide service to our customers  but the rule changes could result in increased competition from the incumbent local exchange carriers against the services we provide 
one of our subsidiaries  shared technologies of canada  operates in toronto  canada 
in addition to internet service  it offers voice services 
generally  the regulation of internet access services and competitive voice services has been similar in canada to that in the us in that providers of such services fewer regulatory requirements than the incumbent local telephone company 
this may change 
also  the canadian government has requirements limiting foreign ownership of certain telecommunications facilities in canada 
we will have to comply with these to the extent we have facilities that are subject to these regulations 
if our interpretation of regulations applicable to our operations is incorrect  we may incur additional expenses or become subject to more stringent regulation 
some of the jurisdictions where we provide services have little  if any  written regulations regarding our operations 
in addition  the written regulations and guidelines that do exist in a jurisdiction may not specifically address our operations 
if our interpretation of these regulations and guidelines is incorrect  we may incur additional expenses to comply with additional regulations applicable to our operations 
our affiliates own more than two thirds of the outstanding voting stock  and thus will control all matters requiring a stockholder vote and  as a result  could prevent or delay any strategic transaction 
our existing directors  executive officers  and greater than five percent stockholders and their affiliates  in the aggregate  beneficially own more than two thirds of the outstanding shares of voting stock 
if all of these stockholders were to vote together as a group  they would have the ability to exert significant influence over our board of directors and its policies 
for instance  these stockholders would be able to control the outcome of all stockholders votes  including votes concerning director elections  charter and bylaw amendments  and possible mergers  corporate control contests  and other significant corporate transactions including any going private transaction 
the concentration of our stock ownership could have the effect of preventing or delaying a change of control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could harm the market price of our common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a takeover premium over the market price for their shares of common stock 
anti takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change of control 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions include the staggered nature of our board of directors which results in directors being elected for terms of three years and the ability of the preferred stockholders to designate four of our seven directors 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in our control  impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover  or other business combination  which in turn could preclude our stockholders from recognizing a premium over the prevailing market price of the common stock 
our former principal independent public accountant  arthur andersen llp  has been found guilty of federal obstruction of justice charges and you are unlikely to be able to exercise effective remedies against them in any legal action 
on june   a jury in houston  texas found our former independent public accountant  arthur andersen llp  guilty of federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the federal government s investigation of enron corp 
as a result  arthur andersen has ceased practicing before the sec 
all of arthur andersen s personnel have left the firm  including the individuals responsible for auditing the cogent and allied riser audited financial statements 
because arthur andersen no longer exists  you are unlikely to be able to exercise effective remedies or collect judgments against them 
moreover  as a public company  we are required to file with the sec financial statements audited or reviewed by an independent public accountant 
on june  the sec issued a statement that it will continue to accept financial statements audited by arthur andersen on an interim basis if arthur andersen is able to make certain representations to its clients concerning audit quality controls 
arthur andersen has made such representations to us 
however  for the reasons noted above  arthur andersen may be unable to make these representations in the future or to provide other information or documents that would customarily be received by us in connection with an offering  including consents and comfort letters 
in addition  arthur andersen may be unable to perform procedures to assure the continued accuracy of its report on the cogent and allied riser audited financial statements 
arthur andersen will be unable to provide such information and documents and perform such procedures in future financings and other transactions 
as a result  we may encounter delays  additional expense and other difficulties in this offering  future financings or other transactions 
we may become involved in a securities class action lawsuit filed against goldman sachs co 
according to a press release dated october   a complaint was filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york charging goldman sachs co 
and certain of its officers and directors with issuing analyst reports regarding allied riser communications that recommended the purchase of allied riser common stock and which set price targets for allied riser common stock  without any reasonable factual basis 
the complaint further alleges that goldman had a conflict of interest and maintained a buy recommendation on allied riser in order to obtain and support lucrative financial deals with allied riser 
allied riser became our subsidiary after the events giving rise to the complaint 
neither cogent  allied riser  nor any of our officers and directors is a defendant in the lawsuit 
however  it is possible that one of the parties in the lawsuit will seek to assert a claim against allied riser now our subsidiary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our financial interests that are sensitive to market risk are entered into for purposes other than trading 
our primary market risk exposure is related to our marketable securities and credit facility 
we place our marketable securities investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
marketable securities were approximately million at december   million of which are considered cash equivalents and mature in days or less and million are short term investments consisting of commercial paper 
our credit facility provides for secured borrowings at the day libor rate plus a specified margin based upon our leverage ratio  as defined in the agreement 
the interest rate resets on a quarterly basis and was a weighted average of as of december  interest payments are deferred and begin in borrowings are secured by a pledge of all of our assets 
the credit facility matures on december  borrowings may be repaid at any time without penalty subject to minimum payment amounts 
as described elsewhere in this report  we have violated the covenant related to minimum net revenues for the fourth quarter of accordingly  we are in default under the facility and the outstanding balance of approximately million at march   may be accelerated by cisco capital and made immediately due and payable 
unless cisco capital agrees to waive the default  we are not entitled to additional borrowings 
we do not anticipate that cisco capital will loan additional working capital to us 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the level at december   the change to our interest sensitive assets and liabilities would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
a increase in the weighted average interest rate for the year ended december  would have increased interest expense for the period by approximately million
