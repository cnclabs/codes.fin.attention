critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  lasalle hotel operating partnership  lp  lhl and its consolidated subsidiaries and partnerships 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized the information available including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements is an estimated contingent lease termination expense of million related to the company s litigation with meridien hotels  inc see item legal proceedings 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by management in formulating its estimates inherent in these financial statements might not materialize 
however  application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from those estimates

revenue recognition for properties not leased by lhl  the company recognizes lease revenue on an accrual basis pursuant to the terms of the respective participating leases 
base rent and participating rent are recognized based on quarterly thresholds  pursuant to the lease agreements 
for properties leased by lhl  the company recognizes hotel operating revenue on an accrual basis consistent with the hotel operations 
investment in hotel properties the company s investments in hotel properties are carried at cost and are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to years for buildings and improvements and three to five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
renovations and or replacements that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation expense to reflect each year with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
should the company lengthen the expected useful life of particular assets  it would be depreciated over more years  and result in less depreciation expense and higher annual net income 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of each hotel to determine if circumstances exist indicating impairment in the carrying value of the investment in the hotel or that depreciation periods should be modified 
if facts or circumstances support the possibility of impairment  the company will prepare an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows  without interest charges  of the specific hotel and determine if the investment in such hotel is recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  an adjustment will be made to the carrying value 
table of contents of the hotel to reflect the hotel at fair value 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income  because making an impairment adjustment results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the company does not believe that there are any factors or circumstances indicating impairment of any of its investments in its hotels

no guarantee exists on behalf of the company for the refinanced loan 
the company has no other off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements  including distributions to shareholders  is its pro rata share of hotel operating cash flow distributed by lhl and lasalle hotel operating partnership  lp s cash flow from the participating leases 
the amended and restated agreement of limited partnership for lasalle hotel operating partnership  lp provides that distributions of available cash shall be distributed at least quarterly 
available cash is generally defined as net income plus any reduction in reserves and minus interest and principal payments on debt  capital expenditures  and additions to reserves and other adjustments 
there are currently no contractual or other arrangements limiting payment of distributions by the lasalle hotel operating partnership  lp similarly  lhl is a wholly owned subsidiary of lasalle hotel operating partnership  lp payments to the lasalle hotel operating partnership  lp are required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the lease agreements between lhl and lasalle hotel operating partnership  lp relating to the properties owned by lasalle hotel operating partnership  lp and leased by lhl 
except for the security deposits required under the participating leases for the three hotels not leased by lhl  the lessees obligations under the participating leases are unsecured and the lessees abilities to make rent payments to lasalle hotel operating partnership  lp  and the company s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to shareholders  is dependent on the lessees abilities to generate sufficient cash flow from the operations of the hotels 
the terrorist attacks of september  dramatically curtailed both business and leisure travel and have exacerbated pressures on an already weakened economy 
the company s operations have been adversely affected by the attacks and subsequent declines in travel 
while there have been modest improvements in occupancy and average daily rates throughout the year  they remain below prior year levels 
the company is unable to determine whether this adverse impact is temporary or of a more lasting duration 
military actions against iraq or other countries  terrorists  new terrorist attacks actual or threatened  a war and other political events may cause a lengthy period of uncertainty that could increase customer reluctance to travel and therefore adversely affect cash flow 
in addition  cash flow from hotel operations is subject to all operating risks common to the hotel industry 
these risks include competition for guests and meetings from other hotels  including as a result of new competition from internet wholesalers and distributors  increases in operating costs including wages  benefits  insurance and energy due to inflation and other factors  which may not be offset in the future by increases in room rates  dependence on demand from business and leisure travelers  including substantial weakness in business travel  which may fluctuate and be seasonal  increases in energy costs  airline fares  and other expenses related to travel  which may deter traveling  the potential of or actual war and its likely negative impact on travel and the economy  and terrorism and actions taken against terrorists may cause additional decreases in business and leisure travel 
these factors could adversely affect the ability of the hotel operators to generate revenues and therefore adversely affect the lessees of the company s hotels and their ability to make rental payments to the company pursuant to the participating leases and therefore impact the company s liquidity

inflation the company s revenues come primarily from its pro rata share of lasalle hotel operating partnership  lp s cash flow from the participating leases and the lhl hotel operating revenues  thus the company s revenues will vary based on changes in the underlying hotels revenues 
therefore  the company relies entirely on the performance of the hotels and the lessees abilities to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
the hotel operators can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit the lessees and hotel operators abilities to raise rates faster than inflation or even at the same rate  as has been the case for the period from the second quarter of through the company s expenses primarily real estate taxes  property and casualty insurance  administrative expenses and lhl hotel operating expenses are subject to inflation 
these expenses are expected to grow with the general rate of inflation  except for property and casualty insurance  liability insurance  employee benefits  and some wages  which are expected to increase at rates higher than inflation  and except for instances in which the properties are subject to periodic real estate tax reassessments

derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effects of interest rate changes 
as of december   approximately including the company s million pro rata portion of indebtedness relating to the company s joint venture investment in the chicago marriott downtown hotel of the company s borrowings were subject to variable rates 
the company limits the risks associated with interest rate changes by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives 
for interest rate exposures  derivatives are used primarily to align rate movements between interest rates associated with the company s hotel operating revenue  participating lease revenue and other financial assets with interest rates on related debt  and manage the cost of borrowing obligations 
the company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risk 
the company requires that hedging derivative instruments be effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designated to hedge 
this effectiveness is essential in order to qualify for hedge accounting 
some derivative instruments are associated with the hedge of an anticipated transaction 
in those cases  hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction will occur 
instruments that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as hedges at the inception of the derivative contract 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified  or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist  all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked to market with changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument matures 
the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  the company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives 
to manage interest rate risk  the company may employ options  forwards  interest rate swaps  caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying exposure 
the company utilizes a variety of borrowings including lines of credit and medium and long term financings 
to reduce overall interest cost  the company uses interest rate instruments  typically interest rate swaps  to convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
interest rate differentials that arise under these swap contracts are 
table of contents recognized in interest expense over the life of the contracts 
the resulting cost of funds is usually lower than that which would have been available if debt with matching characteristics was issued directly 
to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  the company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing as of each valuation date 
for the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives  long term investments and long term debt  standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing models  replacement cost  and termination cost are used to determine fair value 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized 
item a

at december   the carrying value of this mortgage loan approximated its fair value as the interest rate associated with the borrowing approximated current market rates available for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
this loan is subject to a fixed interest rate of  matures on july  and requires interest and principal payments based on a year amortization schedule 
at december   the mortgage loans that are collateralized by the le montrose suite hotel located in west hollywood  california  the new orleans grande hotel and the holiday inn beachside resort located in key west  florida had an aggregate balance of million 
at december   the carrying value of these approximated their fair values as the interest rates associated with the borrowings approximated current market rates available for similar types of borrowing arrangements
