critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
management regularly reviews its accounting policies to make certain they are current and also provide readers of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
these include  but are not limited to  matters related to accounts receivable  inventories  pension benefits  and income taxes 
implementation of these accounting policies includes estimates and judgments by management based on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable 
this may include judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities based on considerations that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition customer sales are recognized when revenue is realized and earned 
the company recognizes revenue when the risk and title passes to the customer  generally at the time of shipment 
customer sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated returns  trade promotions and other discounts  which are recognized as a deduction from sales at the time of sale 
accounts receivable allowances management maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
management also records estimates for customer returns and discounts offered to customers 
should a greater proportion of customers return goods and take advantage of discounts than estimated by the company  additional allowances may be required 
inventories management identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related to these inventories 
historically  these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the company s inventories are considered saleable and the company has been able to liquidate slow moving or obsolete inventories through the company s factory outlet stores or through various discounts to customers 
should management encounter difficulties liquidating slow moving or obsolete inventories  additional provisions may be necessary 
management regularly reviews the adequacy of its inventory reserves and makes adjustments to them as required 
pension benefits pension and post retirement benefit expenses are determined by actuaries using assumptions concerning the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase  and health care cost trend rates 
an actuarial analysis of benefit obligations and plan assets is determined as of september each year 
the funded status of the company s plans and reconciliation of accrued pension cost is determined annually as of december further discussion of the company s pension and post retirement benefit plans and related assumptions is included in note  retirement plans  to the consolidated financial statements included in the annual report on form k 
actual results would be different using other assumptions 
management records an accrual for pension costs associated with the company sponsored noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering the union and non union workers of the company s operations 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying plan assets could result in losses or a higher accrual 
income taxes currently  management has not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  however in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
percentage of net sales references to  and are to fiscal years of the company ended december of the respective year 
net sales costs of goods sold gross margin sg a expenses and plant closing costs in 
income from operations compared to net sales net sales declined to  for compared with  for this decline was primarily due to reduced sales of rugged outdoor footwear  which declined million to million in a number of the company s customers had higher inventories than planned at the end of the fall and winter seasons due to mild weather conditions 
as a result  orders for rugged outdoor footwear in were adversely affected 
demand increased during the fall and winter seasons due to more traditional seasonal weather conditions in most regions of the us where the company s rugged outdoor footwear is sold  which resulted in improved sell through compared with the prior year 
occupational footwear sales increased million to million in these sales are less susceptible to weather conditions and occur throughout the year 
the company introduced additional work styles in that were well received by customers 
sales of military boots to the us government declined million to million in due to fulfillment of a contract that began in which was completed in the second quarter these sales are dependent on specific awards from the us government based on a competitive bidding process  which occur from time to time 
casual footwear sales declined million to million in  consistent with the company s reduced emphasis on this footwear category 
rocky branded apparel and accessories  were introduced in the first quarter this line extension of the rocky brand achieved strong sell through in  resulting in sales of approximately million 
the company reacquired the licensing rights to rocky r kids and rocky r socks in the first quarter the company s factory outlet stores had net sales of million in compared with million the prior year 
this was primarily due to lower sales in the company s nelsonville store 
average list prices for the company s footwear  clothing and accessories were similar in compared with gross margin gross margin increased to of net sales in compared with in benefits from the company s manufacturing realignment  increased sourcing  and more favorable product mix contributed to the improvement 
in absolute dollars  gross margin rose  or  to  in from  the prior year 
the company closed its nelsonville  ohio factory in the fourth quarter and moved that production capacity to its factory in puerto rico 
the manufacturing realignment was completed in the fourth quarter  contributing to improved operating efficiencies and lower manufacturing costs in the company has been sourcing footwear from outside the united states since in  sourced footwear and branded apparel and accessories represented of total net sales versus in the increase in sourced products sales as a percentage of total sales is expected to continue in the future  however  may not be at the same year over year growth rates 
military boots are manufactured for the us government based on specific  competitively bid  contract awards 
the company manufactured military boots from second quarter to second quarter these military boots were produced at margins substantially below the company s overall gross margin as a percentage of net sales 
selling  general administrative expenses selling  general administrative sg a expenses increased  or  to  in compared to  in higher pension expenses  relatively small increases in multiple expense categories and start up costs associated with the launching of the company s work western boot line a sub category of the occupational category accounted for the small increase in sg a 
the more significant increase in sg a as a percentage of net sales was the result of reduced net sales for the year 
sg a expenses were of net sales in versus the prior year  principally due to the decline in nets sales in interest expense interest expense declined  or  to  for from  in the company benefited from substantial improvement in cash from operations  a portion of which was used to reduce outstanding debt under the company s credit facility 
lower interest rates also contributed to the reduction in interest expense in the company s funded debt decreased to  at december  versus  a year ago 
the company s investment in capital assets was substantially below depreciation expense for it was also able to continue to reduce inventory balances and accounts receivable 
these factors  along with the reinvestment back into the company of income contributed to the reduced reliance on borrowings 
income taxes the company recognized income tax expense of  for compared with an income tax benefit of  for the company s effective tax rate for was  which is lower than the statutory rate of due to proportionately more income being earned in offshore jurisdictions and the decision to not repatriate foreign earnings to the us the income tax benefit recognized during resulted primarily from an abatement of puerto rico tollgate taxes on all earnings subsequent to june  this resulted in a deferred tax benefit of  compared to net sales net sales rose to  for compared with  for this increase was primarily due to sales of military footwear  initial shipments of which were made during second quarter to a lesser extent  sales of accessory items contributed to the increase 
offsetting the increase were decreases in sales within each other major footwear category for the company attributes these reduced sales to the general softness within the economy  especially during the second half of  and milder than normal weather during its peak selling season 
average list prices for the company s product were approximately higher in than in gross margin gross margin decreased  or  to  in versus  in as a percentage of net sales  gross margin decreased to in from in included sales of intermediate cold wet military boots with gross margins below the company s average rate

improved pricing policies combined with an increase in sourced footwear to of net sales in from the prior year benefited gross margin for the year ended december selling  general administrative expenses selling  general administrative sg a expenses decreased  or  to  in compared to  in as a percentage of net sales  sg a declined to from in the most significant factors contributing to the reduction in sg a expenses for the were lower selling costs resulting from a restructuring of the sales force and reduced bad debt expense 
salaries and wages as well as advertising expenses were lower than the prior year  which offset higher fringe benefits for increased pension accruals  anticipated performance incentives  and additional professional fees 
the company continues to seek additional cost reductions that will benefit long term performance 
in addition  the company announced plans to realign its manufacturing operations on september   which included ceasing manufacturing operations at the nelsonville  ohio factory during fourth quarter a restructuring charge of million was recorded in for anticipated expenses associated with the realignment of manufacturing operations 
a summary of the costs accrued includes severance  pension and employee benefit costs  equipment and relocation costs  and legal and other expenses 
interest expense interest expense declined  or  to  for from  in the company benefited from lower outstanding balances and lower interest rates during  which were partially offset by a  reduction in second quarter interest expense due to a gain on the termination of an interest rate swap agreement 
the company s funded debt decreased to  at december  versus  a year ago due to reductions to inventories  accounts receivable and capital expenditures 
income taxes the company recognized income tax benefit of  for compared with an income tax expense of  for the current year benefit resulted primarily from an abatement of puerto rico tollgate taxes on all earnings subsequent to june  this resulted in a deferred tax benefit of impact of accounting standards in april  the fasb issued sfas  rescission of fasb statements   and  amendment of fasb statement  and technical corrections 
this statement rescinds sfas  reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and an amendment of that statement  sfas  extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
this statement also rescinds sfas  accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers 
this statement amends sfas  accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
this statement also amends other authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
this statement is effective for the first quarter in the year ended december  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities included in restructurings 
this statement eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs as defined in eitf issue  and requires that liabilities for exit activities be recognized when incurred instead of at the exit activity commitment date 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires a guarantor to recognize a liability  at the inception of the guarantee  for the fair value of obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee and also includes more detailed disclosures with respect to guarantees 
fin is effective for guarantees issued or modified starting january  and requires additional disclosures for the year ended december  we do not expect the provisions of fin to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of sfas the transition provisions and the disclosure requirements of this statement are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we continue to apply the intrinsic value based method to account for stock options and have complied with the new disclosure requirements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities fin  to expand upon and strengthen existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
until now  one company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin changes that by requiring a variable interest entity  as defined  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to older entities in the fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements  none of which appear to apply to us at this time  are effective in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we do not expect the provisions of fin to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements
