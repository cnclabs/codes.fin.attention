item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in this report  including those set forth under item  business special considerations 
overview we design  develop  and market interactive electronic bingo systems 
we currently market portable hand held systems that can be played anywhere within a bingo hall and a fixed base system with light pen or touchscreen activated monitors 
as of october   we had systems in service in over of the more than states that allow electronic bingo systems for use with charitable and commercial organizations 
under the indian gaming regulatory act  or igra  electronic bingo may be played on native american lands in the states where bingo is legal 
we estimate that bingo currently is played on tribal native american lands in states 
as of october   we had units in operation in native american bingo halls in of those states 
collectively  as of october   we had products in states and in countries outside of the united states 
we generate revenue by placing electronic bingo systems in bingo halls under contracts based on a a fixed fee per use per session  b a fixed weekly fee per unit  or c a percentage of the revenues generated by each unit 
revenue growth is affected by player acceptance of electronic bingo as an addition or an alternative to paper bingo  and our ability to expand operations into new markets 
fixed base bingo units generate greater revenue per unit than portable bingo units  but also require a greater initial capital investment 
we typically install our electronic bingo systems at no charge to our customers  and we capitalize the costs 
we record depreciation of bingo equipment over a three and five year estimated useful life using the straight line method of depreciation 
our expenses consist primarily of a cost of revenue  consisting of expenses associated with technical and operational support of the bingo systems within bingo halls  depreciation of bingo units  repair  refurbishment  and disposals of bingo units and related support equipment  and excess or obsolescence reserve  b general and administrative  consisting of activities associated with management of our company and related support  which includes finance and accounting  legal  compliance  information systems  human resources  accounts receivable reserve  and goodwill amortization prior to fiscal  c sales and marketing  consisting primarily of commissions paid to distributors for promoting and supporting our products and an internal sales force with a focus upon generating new customers and upgrades for existing customers  and d research and development r d  consisting of company sponsored r d activities to provide players with new or enhanced products on which to play bingo 
during fiscal  a number of events occurred that affected  or may in the future affect  our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources 
we expended approximately million as an investment in bingo units and related support equipment 
this investment included the installation of over  new ted c portable  color display units and the introduction of flat screens as an enhancement to our fixed base units in many markets 
in total  the number of our bingo units installed in the field increased by over during fiscal additionally  we had more than a increase in the number of installations of our redesigned back office accounting system software  the alltrak during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we terminated  for cause  our relationship with our primary distributor in texas and began transitioning the distribution of our products to our other texas distributors 
while the transition caused some short term disruption in the texas market  we believe we have completed the process and have retained virtually all of our customer relationships in the state 
we are in litigation with our former distributor 
the terms of the distributor agreement contain certain contingent commission liabilities  and other liabilities  which if a final judgment were rendered unfavorable to us  could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
no trial date has been set and there can be no assurance of a favorable outcome of the litigation 
no amounts have been reserved for settlement of this lawsuit 
all accounts receivable from the distributor have been reserved by us  although the court has ordered approximately  of funds collected by the distributor  on our behalf  to be placed in a restricted account pending resolution of the litigation 
in september  we became aware of a situation involving the unauthorized misuse of our system in nevada 
the misuse involved our fixed base units and was allegedly the result of the manipulation of the system  for personal gain  by a then employee of our company 
in cooperation with regulatory officials in nevada  texas  and mississippi  we voluntarily shut down our fixed based units in those states while we worked with gaming officials to assure them of the integrity of our system security 
our units were turned back on in texas in a matter of days  but remained turned off in nevada and mississippi through fiscal year end 
units in mississippi were restored to service in mid november and in nevada by mid december 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  bingo unit depreciation  goodwill impairment  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for bingo units placed in bingo halls under contracts based on a a fixed fee per use per session  b a fixed weekly fee per unit  or c a percentage of the revenue generated by each unit 
our revenue recognition is a key component of our results of operations  and determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states when all of the following factors exist a evidence of an arrangement with the customer  b play or availability of the bingo units  c a fixed or determinable fee  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
we exercise judgment in assessing the creditworthiness of our customers and therefore in our determination of whether collectibility is reasonably assured 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine these criteria are not met for future transactions  revenue recognized for future reporting periods could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the possible losses resulting from non payment of outstanding accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and distributors for creditworthiness  economic trends  changes in our customer payment terms  and historical collection experience when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also reserve a percentage of our accounts receivable based on aging category 
in determining these percentages  we review historical write offs of our receivables  payment trends  and other available information 
while such estimates have been within our expectations and the provisions established  a change in financial condition of specific customers or in overall trends experienced may result in future adjustments of our estimates of recoverability of our receivables 
reserve for bingo unit obsolescence we provide reserves for excess or obsolete bingo units on hand that we do not expect to be used 
our reserves are based upon several factors  including our estimated forecast of bingo unit demand for placement into halls 
our estimates of future bingo unit demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete bingo units 
although we attempt to assure the accuracy of our estimated forecasts  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our bingo units and our reported operating results 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we elected to early adopt statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  during our fiscal year end october   and accordingly we discontinued amortization of our goodwill as of november  we completed the required measurement test as of that date and determined there was no impairment of goodwill upon adoption of sfas no 
this measurement included market multiple methodology and a discounted cash flow methodology 
in addition  we are also required to perform an annual goodwill impairment review 
the review for fiscal was completed as of july  the valuation date  and we determined there was no impairment of goodwill as of that date 
any subsequent impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  a significant decrease in the market price of an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statement of operations data for our company expressed as a percentage of revenue years ended october  statement of operations data revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses general and administrative sales and marketing research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net income loss before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss year ended october  compared with year ended october  revenue 
we generated revenue of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase of approximately  or  was primarily a result of growth in the western region and the canadian market  partially offset with a decline in the northeast region 
revenues in nevada and mississippi were adversely affected by the shutdown of our fixed base units in those states for approximately the last five weeks of fiscal the two day shutdown of our fixed base units in texas had a minor negative affect on our revenues 
installed units increased by over from october  to october   driven by the installation of ted c units 
however  revenue per unit was lower due to competitive pricing pressures and changes in the composition of unit usage 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue decreased million  or  to million for fiscal from million during fiscal cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for the current fiscal year was compared to for fiscal cost of revenue includes  among other items  charges for refurbishment  repair and disposal of bingo units as well as recognition of excess or obsolete bingo units 
these charges in fiscal amounted to million  an improvement of million from the prior year 
fiscal included a million charge for excess uninstalled units as a result of the forecasted impact of the introduction of our new hand held product  the ted c 
other items in cost of revenue include service and operations expenses and depreciation of bingo units 
these items amounted to million in fiscal  an increase of  over fiscal the increase was primarily due to growth of approximately  in our service and operations costs  principally as a result of increased personnel costs 
bingo unit depreciation and other cost of revenue items increased by approximately  over fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a million decrease 
general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue for the current year were compared to for fiscal general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our executive management and our finance and accounting  legal  compliance  information technology  and human resources departments 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a a million decrease in amortization of goodwill due to our election to early adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill in fiscal  b a reduction of approximately million in the provision for uncollectable accounts receivable despite the reserve in the fourth quarter of fiscal of approximately  related to the termination of our largest distributor in texas  primarily as a result of improved credit and collection controls in fiscal  and fiscal including an unfavorable adjustment of approximately  for settlement of disputed account balances  and c an improvement of approximately million in personnel related costs due to a reduction of approximately million in costs related to severance and retirement of various management employees and additional cost containment efforts in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing decreased approximately million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased from during fiscal to during fiscal sales and marketing includes distributor commissions and related personnel  travel  promotional  and support costs 
distributor commissions decreased  to million due to the changes in mix of revenue generated by distributors and those customers served directly by us  offset by slightly higher termination and settlement costs in fiscal the balance of the decrease in sales and marketing was primarily due to reductions in personnel related costs and travel expenses 
research and development 
research and development costs decreased  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal research and development costs as a percentage of revenue decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to fiscal events a retirement of a co founder and associated costs of  and b costs of approximately  associated with centralization of research and development personnel to reno  nevada 
excluding those expenses from last year  research and development costs increased approximately  over the prior year  representing increased research and development expenditures for new or enhanced products on which to play bingo 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was approximately and for the fiscal years ended october  and  respectively 
the change in effective tax rates reflects the effect of state income taxes and nondeductible expenses on the pre tax loss in fiscal  which included amortization of goodwill without the goodwill the effective rate for fiscal was versus pre tax income in the current year 
year ended october  compared with year ended october  revenue 
we generated revenue of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the approximately million  or  net decline in revenue from fiscal was primarily attributable to competitive pricing pressures  as well as the removal of approximately  bingo units in the southern region due to cancellation of a distributor contract during the second quarter of fiscal revenue increases were experienced in the northeastern and western regions and internationally 
installed units increased  units  from approximately  units at october  to approximately  units at october  however  revenue per unit generated by these additional units  in some cases  were lower due to fewer bingo sessions played per week or pricing pressures 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased million  or  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal cost of revenue as a percent of revenue for the current fiscal year was compared to for fiscal the increase during fiscal for cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a increased bingo unit maintenance  repair and refurbishment expenses of million compared to the prior year  principally as a result of an increased focus on the repair and upgrade of existing units as opposed to the acquisition of new units  b an increase in the provision for excess uninstalled bingo units of million based on forecasts of unit placements impacted by expected new product ted c placements in fiscal and beyond  and c bingo unit depreciation expenses increased  as a result of an increase in the number of bingo units installed and our revised estimate of useful life for uninstalled units that began in the first quarter of fiscal service and operational costs aggregating approximately million and million  during fiscal years and  respectively  remained constant 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a million increase 
general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our executive management and our finance  legal and compliance  information technology  and human resources departments 
the increase in expenses over the prior year consists principally of an increase in personnel and related costs of million to million  including increases of  for severance costs associated with the retirement of a co founder and other executive management departures 
the provision for uncollectable accounts receivable increased million to million  including  relating to additional provision for distributors 
net increases in all other areas of  were offset by a reduction of  relating to relocation costs of the corporate offices to reno incurred during fiscal sales and marketing 
sales  marketing  and distributor commission expenses increased approximately million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from during fiscal to during fiscal payroll and related benefits increased  due to additional personnel and increases in compensation and benefits 
distributor commissions increased  to million  or as a percentage of revenue during fiscal compared to during fiscal the increase in distributor commissions as a percentage of revenue is a result of a higher commission rates in states with increased revenue in comparison to the prior year  versus the commission rates in states in which revenue declined from the prior year  and b the settlement of a distributor issue in the first quarter of fiscal for approximately research and development 
research and development costs increased  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal research and development costs as a percentage of revenue increased from during fiscal to during fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a retirement of a research and development co founder and associated costs of  and b centralization of research and development personnel to reno  nevada  and other employee costs of  offset in part by reduced project costs of  interest income expense 
net interest income totaled  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decline was primarily the result of our reduction of  in short term investments and substantially lower interest rates 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the change in effective tax rates reflects the effect of state income taxes and nondeductible expenses on the pre tax loss in fiscal versus pre tax income in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided million of cash during fiscal compared to million during fiscal the million consisted primarily of net income of million adjusted by million for depreciation  amortization  and obsolescence provisions offset by a net change of million in other operating assets and liabilities 
during fiscal  the million provided by operating activities consisted primarily of depreciation  amortization  and obsolescence provisions of million  adjusting a net loss of million 
we used approximately million of cash in investing activities during fiscal compared to million of cash during fiscal the million consisted of million of capital expenditures million of which was expended on bingo units and associated support equipment and an increase in short term investments of million 
during fiscal  the million consisted of million of capital expenditures million of which was for bingo units and associated support equipment offset by cash received from the sale of short term investments 
we used million in cash for financing activities during fiscal compared to  during fiscal the million used during fiscal was primarily for payments of million on long term debt  offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of million 
the  used during fiscal was primarily for payments of million on long term debt  offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of  as of october   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
on november   we paid cash of million to acquire certain assets of international gaming systems  llc 
among other things  the acquisition added approximately  fixed base bingo units to our installed base  principally in mississippi and new york 
the purchase price was paid from our cash and cash equivalents and involved no financing 
in addition to our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  we have a million line of credit with wells fargo bank  na  which has an interest rate based on the prime rate or libor plus  at our option  on which there was no outstanding balance at october  the revolving credit facility expires on april  we expect to renew the revolving credit facility with similar terms 
we believe that cash flow from operations and cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments on hand  together with funds available under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to support our operations and provide for budgeted capital expenditures and liquidity requirements through fiscal our long term liquidity requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate at which we expand our business  and whether we do so internally or through acquisitions 
in addition  strategic opportunities we may pursue could require us to fund our portion of operating expenses of such ventures and may require us to advance additional amounts should any partners in such ventures be unable to meet unanticipated capital calls or similar funding events 
to the extent that the funds generated from the sources described above are insufficient to fund our activities in the long term  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if it is available  it will be on terms acceptable to us 
the following table presents information on contractual obligations held as of october  contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases     other long term obligations     total contractual cash obligations    inflation and general economic condition although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had  or is likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our revolving credit facility with wells fargo is a million line of credit with an interest rate based on the prime rate or london interbank offered rate or libor plus  at our option 
the line of credit expires on april  because the interest rate on the revolving credit facility is variable  our cash flow may be affected by increases in interest rates  in that we would be required to pay more interest in the event that both the prime and libor interest rates increase 
we do not believe  however  that any risk inherent in the variable rate nature of the loan is likely to have a material effect on our interest expense or available cash 
we currently maintain a zero balance on the revolving credit facility 
sensitivity analysis 
assuming we had a million balance outstanding as of october   the rate of interest calculated using the prime rate option would be 
our monthly interest payment  if the rate stayed constant  would be  if the prime rate rose to  which assumes an unusually large increase  our monthly payment would be  a more likely increase of or  given the recent trend of decreasing or relatively low interest rates  would result in a monthly payment of  or  respectively 
we do not believe the risk resulting from such fluctuations is material or that the payment required would have a material effect on cash flow
