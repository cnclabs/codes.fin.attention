item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general critical accounting policies the company s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
if these estimates or assumptions are incorrect  there could be a material change in the company s financial condition or operating results 
many of these critical accounting policies are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the company s businesses and operations 
the company s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition related to membership and associate fees  deferral of membership and associate related costs  accrual of membership benefits liability  expense recognition related to commissions to associates and accounting for legal contingencies 
revenue recognition membership and associate fees the company s principal revenues are derived from membership fees  most of which are collected on a monthly basis 
memberships are generally guaranteed renewable and non cancelable except for fraud  non payment of membership fees or upon written request 
membership fees are recognized in income ratably over the related service period in accordance with membership terms  which generally require the holder of the membership to remit fees on an annual  semi annual or monthly basis 
approximately of members remit their membership fees on a monthly basis  of which approximately are paid in advance and  therefore  are deferred and recognized over the following month 
the company also charges new members  who are not part of an employee group  a enrollment fee 
this enrollment fee and related incremental direct and origination costs are deferred and recognized in income over the estimated life of a membership in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab 
the company computes the expected membership life using over years of actuarial data as explained in more detail in the measures of membership retention section of md a 
at december   management computed the expected membership life to be approximately years 
if the expected membership life were to change significantly  which management does not expect in the short term  the deferred membership enrollment fee and related costs would be recognized over a longer or shorter period 
the company derives revenues from services provided to its marketing sales force from a one time non refundable enrollment fee of from each new sales associate for which the company provides initial sales and marketing supplies and enrollment services to the associate 
revenue from  and costs of  the initial sales and marketing supplies approximately are recognized when the materials are delivered to the associates 
the remaining of revenues and related incremental direct and origination costs are deferred and recognized over the estimated average active service period of associates which at december  is estimated to be approximately six months 
management estimates the active service period of an associate periodically based on the average number of months an associate produces new memberships including those associates that fail to write any memberships 
if the active service period of associates changes significantly  the deferred revenue and related costs will be recognized over the new estimated active service period 
the company also encourages participation in a training program fast start that allows an associate who successfully completes the program to advance through the various commission levels at a faster rate 
associates participating in this training program typically pay a fee ranging from to  depending on special promotions the company implements from time to time 
the fee covers the additional training and materials used in the training program  and is recognized in income upon completion of the training 
associate services also includes revenue recognized on the sale of marketing supplies and promotional material to associates and includes fees related to the company s eservice program for associates 
the eservice program provides subscribers internet based back office support such as reports  on line documents  tools  a personal email account and up to three personalized web sites with flash movie presentations 
member and associate costs deferred costs represent the incremental direct and origination costs the company incurs in enrolling new members and new associates related to the deferred revenue discussed above  and that portion of payments made to provider law firms and associates related to deferred membership revenue 
deferred costs for enrolling new members include the cost of the membership kit and salary and benefit costs for employees who process membership enrollments 
deferred costs for enrolling new associates include training and success bonuses paid to individuals involved in recruiting the associate and salary and benefit costs of employees who process associate enrollments 
such costs are deferred to the extent of the lesser of actual costs incurred or the amount of the related fee charged for such services 
deferred costs are amortized to expense over the same period as the related deferred revenue as discussed above 
deferred costs that will be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are classified as current and all remaining deferred costs are considered noncurrent 
associate related costs are reflected as associate services and direct marketing  and are expensed as incurred if not related to the deferred revenue discussed above 
these costs include providing materials and services to associates  fast start bonuses  associate introduction kits  the associate incentive program  group marketing and marketing services departments including costs of related travel  marketing events  leadership summits and international sales convention 
membership benefits liability approximately of active memberships at december  have benefits delivered by a designated provider law firm with whom the company has arranged for the services to be provided in a particular geographic area  typically a state or province 
provider law firms receive a fixed monthly payment for each member in their service area and are responsible for providing the membership benefits without additional remuneration 
the fixed cost aspect of this arrangement provides significant advantages to the company in managing its claims risk 
amounts due the provider law firms at period end under these capitated agreements are included in the membership benefits liability 
membership benefit costs relating to non provider memberships open panel memberships primarily sold prior to or memberships in states where a provider law firm is not in place  which constituted approximately of memberships in force at december   are based on the usual  reasonable and customary fee for providing the required services 
such costs are generally paid on a current basis  as most costs are certain in amount and require only limited investigation 
the company maintains a reserve for estimated incurred but not reported open panel membership benefit costs as well as costs which are in the payment process 
these reserves  which are recorded in the membership benefits liability  are reviewed annually by an independent actuary as necessary in conjunction with the preparation and filing of financial statements and other reports with various state insurance regulatory authorities 
underwriting risks associated with the open panel memberships are managed primarily through contractual benefit limitations and  as a result  underwriting decisions are not necessarily based on individual membership purchases 
commissions to associates beginning with new memberships written after march   the company implemented a level commission schedule approximately per annum at december  with up to a three year advance commission payment 
prior to march   the company s commission program provided for advance commission payments to associates of approximately of first year membership premiums on new membership sales and commissions were earned by the associate at a rate of approximately in all subsequent years 
effective march   and in order to offer additional incentives for increased membership retention rates  the company returned to a differential commission structure with rates of approximately of first year membership premiums on new memberships written and variable renewal commission rates ranging from five to per annum based on the first month membership retention rate of the associate s personal sales and those of his organization 
prior to march   the company had a level membership commission schedule of approximately of membership fees  with up to a three year advance commission payment on new membership sales 
prior to january the company advanced commissions at the time of sale of all new memberships 
in january  the company implemented a policy whereby the associate receives only earned commissions on the first three sales unless the associate has successfully completed the fast start training program 
for all sales beginning with the fourth membership or all sales made by an associate successfully completing the fast start training program  the company currently advances commission payments at the time of sale of a new membership 
the amount of cash potentially advanced upon the sale of a new membership  prior to the recoupment of any charge backs described below  represents an amount equal to up to one year commission earnings 
although the average number of marketing associates receiving an advance commission payment on a new membership is  the overall initial advance may be paid to more than thirty different individuals  each at a different level within the overall commission structure 
the commission advance immediately increases an associate s unearned advance commission balance to the company 
although the company  prior to march   advanced its sales associates up to three years commission when a membership is sold and subsequent to march   up to one years commission  the average commission advance paid to its sales associates as a group is actually less than the maximum amount possible because some associates choose to receive less than a full advance and the company pays less than a full advance on some of its specialty products 
in addition  the company may from time to time place associates on a less than full advance basis if there are problems with the quality of the business being submitted or other performance problems with an associate 
also  any residual commissions due an associate defined as commission on an individual membership after the advance has been earned are retained to reduce any remaining unearned commission advance balances prior to being paid to that sales associate 
the commission cost per new membership sold has increased over each of the last three years by  and for  and  respectively  and varies depending on the compensation structure that is in place at the time a new membership is sold and the amount of any charge backs recoupment of previous commission advances that are deducted from amounts that would otherwise be paid to the various sales associates that are compensated for the membership sale 
should the company add additional commissions to its compensation plan or reduce the amount of chargebacks collected from its associates  the commission cost per new membership will increase accordingly 
the average commission advance in for the period subsequent to march  was years and for the period prior to march  was years compared to the and averages of approximately years and years  respectively 
the company expenses advance commissions ratably over the first month of the related membership 
as a result of this accounting policy  the company s commission expenses are all recognized over the first month of a membership and there is no commission expense recognized for the same membership during the remainder of the advance period 
the company tracks its unearned advance commission balances outstanding in order to ensure the advance commissions are recovered before any renewal commissions are paid and for internal purposes of analyzing its commission advance program 
while not recorded as an asset  unearned advance commission balances from associates for the following years ended december were amounts in s beginning unearned advance commission balances    advance commissions  net    earned commissions applied    advance commission write offs    ending unearned advance commission balances before estimated unrecoverable balances    estimated unrecoverable advance commission balances    ending unearned advance commission balances  net    these amounts do not represent fair value  as they do not take into consideration timing of estimated recoveries 
in  the company began writing off unearned advanced commission balances rather than increasing the estimated unrecoverable balance when the associate had no remaining active memberships since the associate would no longer have any future commission earnings 
estimated unrecoverable advances increased as a percentage of ending advances from at december  to at december  due to the change in the compensation structure described above from a month possible advance to a month possible advance 
this change allows the advances to be earned more quickly by the associate so the increase in advances before estimated unrecoverable balances increased from to compared to an increase of from to the ending unearned advance commission balances  net  above includes net unearned advance commission balances of non vested associates of million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
as such  at december  future commissions and related expense will be reduced as unearned advance commission balances of million are recovered 
commissions are earned by the associate as membership premiums are earned by the company  usually on a monthly basis 
the company reduces unearned advance commission balances or remits payment to an associate  as appropriate  when commissions are earned 
should a membership lapse before the advances have been recovered for each commission level  the company generates an immediate charge back to the applicable sales associate to recapture up to of any unearned advance on memberships written prior to march   and on any memberships written thereafter 
this charge back is deducted from any future advances that would otherwise be payable to the associate for additional new memberships 
in order to encourage additional membership sales  the company waived chargebacks for associates that met certain criteria in december and march  which effectively increases the company s commission expense 
any remaining unearned advance commission balance may be recovered by withholding future residual earned commissions due to an active associate on active memberships 
additionally  even though a commission advance may have been fully recovered on a particular membership  no additional commission earnings from any membership are paid to an associate until all previous advances on all memberships  both active and lapsed  have been recovered 
the company also has reduced chargebacks from to for certain senior marketing associates who have demonstrated the ability to maintain certain levels of sales over specified periods 
the company may adjust chargebacks from time to time in the future in order to encourage certain production incentives 
prior to march   the company charged associates a fee on unearned advance commission balances relating to lapsed memberships membership lapse fee 
the fee that was recorded on the associates unearned commission balance was determined by applying the prime interest rate to the unearned advance commission balance pertaining to lapsed memberships 
the company realized and recognized this fee only when the amount of the calculated fee was collected by withholding from cash commission payments due the associate 
the fees collected reduced commission expense 
the company s ability to recover these fees was primarily dependant on the associate selling new memberships  which qualify for commission advances 
the company eliminated the membership lapse fee for memberships sold after march  in conjunction with the change in the commission structure described above 
the company has the contractual right to require associates to repay unearned advance commission balances from sources other than earned commissions including cash a from all associates either i upon termination of the associate relationship  which includes but is not limited to when an associate becomes non vested or ii when it is ascertained that earned commissions are insufficient to repay the unearned advance commission payments and b upon demand  from agencies or associates who are parties to the associate agreements signed between october and july or july to august  respectively 
the sources  other than earned commissions  that may be available to recover associate unearned advance commission balances are potentially subject to limitation based on applicable state laws relating to creditors rights generally 
historically  the company has not demanded repayments of the unearned advance commission balances from associates  including terminated associates  because collection efforts would likely increase costs and have the potential to disrupt the company s relationships with its sales associates 
this business decision by the company has a significant effect on the company s cash flow by electing to defer collection of advance payments of which approximately million were not expected to be collected from future commissions at december  however  the company regularly reviews the unearned advance commission balance status of associates and will exercise its right to require associates to repay advances when management believes that such action is appropriate 
non vested associates are those that are no longer vested because they fail to meet the company s established vesting requirements by selling at least three new memberships per quarter or retaining a personal membership 
non vested associates lose their right to any further commissions earned on memberships previously sold at the time they become non vested 
as a result the company has no continuing obligation to individually account to these associates as it does to active associates and is entitled to retain all commission earnings that would be otherwise payable to these terminated associates 
the company does continue to reduce the unearned advance commission balances for commissions earned on active memberships previously sold by those associates 
substantially all individual non vested associate unearned advance commission balances were less than  and the average balance was at december  although the advance commissions are expensed ratably over the first month of the related membership  the company assesses  at the end of each quarter  on an associate by associate basis  the recoverability of each associate s unearned advanced commission balance by estimating the associate s future commissions to be earned on active memberships 
each active membership is assumed to lapse in accordance with the company s estimated future lapse rate  which is based on the company s actual historical membership retention experience as applied to each active membership s year of origin 
the lapse rate is based on the company s more than year history of membership retention rates  which is updated quarterly to reflect actual experience 
the company also closely reviews current data for any trends that would affect the historical lapse rate 
the sum of all expected future commissions to be earned for each associate is then compared to that associate s unearned advance commission balance 
the company estimates unrecoverable advance commission balances when expected future commissions to be earned on active memberships aggregated on an associate by associate basis are less than the unearned advance commission balance 
if an associate with an outstanding unearned advance commission balance has no active memberships  the unearned advance commission balance is written off but has no financial statement impact as advance commissions are expensed ratably over the first month of the related memberships 
refer to measures of member retention expected membership life  expected remaining membership life for a description of the method used by the company to estimate future commission earnings 
further  the company s analysis of the recoverability of unearned advance commission balances is also based on the assumption that the associate does not write any new memberships 
the company believes that this assessment methodology is highly conservative since its actual experience is that many associates do continue to sell new memberships and the company  through its chargeback rights  gains an additional source to recover unearned advance commission balances 
legal contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
given the inherent unpredictability of litigation  it is difficult to estimate the impact of litigation on the company s financial condition or results of operation 
sfas  accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
the company evaluates  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
the company has established an accrued liability it believes will be sufficient to cover estimated damages in connection with various cases  which at december  was million 
this process requires subjective judgment about the likely outcomes of litigation 
liabilities related to most of the company s lawsuits are especially difficult to estimate due to the nature of the claims  limitation of available data and uncertainty concerning the numerous variables used to determine likely outcomes or the amounts recorded 
litigation expenses are recorded as incurred and the company does not accrue for future legal fees 
it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases or increased litigation costs could have an adverse effect upon the company s financial condition  operating results or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
see legal proceedings 
operating ratios three principal operating measures monitored by the company in addition to measures of membership retention are the membership benefit ratio  commission ratio and the general and administrative expense ratio 
the membership benefits ratio  the commissions ratio and the general and administrative expense ratio represent those costs as a percentage of membership fees 
the company strives to maintain these ratios as low as possible while at the same time providing adequate incentive compensation to its sales associates and provider law firms 
these ratios do not measure total profitability because they do not take into account all revenues and expenses 
cash flow considerations relating to sales of memberships the company generally advances significant commissions at the time a membership is sold 
since approximately of membership fees are collected on a monthly basis  a significant cash flow deficit is created at the time a membership is sold 
this deficit is reduced as monthly membership fees are remitted and no additional commissions are paid on the membership until all previous unearned advance commission balances have been fully recovered 
since the cash advanced at the time of sale of a new membership may be recovered over a multi year period  cash flow from operations may be adversely affected depending on the number of new memberships written in relation to the existing active base of memberships and the composition of new or existing sales associates producing such memberships 
income tax matters net operating losses the company has a net operating loss carryforward nol in the amount of  as of december  representing the remaining nols of tpn 
the ability of the company to utilize nols and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future federal income taxes is subject to various limitations under the internal revenue code of  as amended  but the company expects to fully utilize the remaining tpn nol in the income tax return for investment policy the company s investment policy is to some degree controlled by certain insurance regulations  which  coupled with management s own investment philosophy  results in a conservative investment portfolio that is not risk oriented 
the company s investments consist of common stocks  investment grade rated baa or higher preferred stocks and investment grade bonds primarily issued by corporations  the united states treasury  federal agencies  federally sponsored agencies and enterprises  as well as mortgage backed securities and state and municipal tax exempt bonds 
the company is required to pledge investments to various state insurance departments as a condition to obtaining authority to do business in certain states 
disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheets include a certain amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risk 
due to the company s significant investment in fixed maturity investments  interest rate risk represents the largest market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial position 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
as of december   substantially all of the company s investments were in investment grade rated baa or higher fixed maturity investments and interest bearing money market accounts including certificates of deposit 
the company does not hold any investments classified as trading account assets or derivative financial instruments 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly  with no effect given to any steps that management might take to counteract that change 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates reflect what could be deemed best and worst case scenarios 
the fair values shown in the following table are based on contractual maturities 
significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and  therefore  actual results might differ from those reflected in the following table hypothetical change estimated fair value in interest rate after hypothetical fair value bp basis points change in interest rate dollars in thousands fixed maturity investments at december   bp increase  bp increase  bp decrease  bp decrease  fixed maturity investments at december   bp increase  bp increase  bp decrease  bp decrease  excluding short term investments with a fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the table above illustrates  for example  that an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates at december  would reduce the estimated fair value of the company s fixed maturity investments by approximately million at that date 
at december   and based on the fair value of fixed maturity investments of million  an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates would have reduced the estimated fair value of the company s fixed maturity investments by approximately million at that date 
the company s decreased sensitivity to rising interest rates is due to the million decrease in fixed maturity investments at december  of million from million at december  the definitive extent of the interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable due to the variability of future interest rates  but the company does not believe such risk is material 
the company primarily manages its exposure to interest rate risk by purchasing investments that can be readily liquidated should the interest rate environment begin to significantly change 
accounting standards to be adopted in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect sfas to materially impact its reported results 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections  that  among other things  rescinded sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
with the rescission of sfas no 
 the early extinguishment of debt generally will no longer be classified as an extraordinary item for financial statement presentation purposes 
the provision is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  the company does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which replaces emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the new standard required companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the statement is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the new standard provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
additionally  the statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used in reported results 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  in compliance with sfas no 
 the company has elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method in accounting for its stock based employee compensation arrangement as defined by apb no 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirement for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
for a guarantee subject to fasb interpretation no 
 a guarantor is required to measure and recognize the fair value of the guarantee liability at inception 
for many guarantees  fair value will likely be determined using the expected present value method described in fasb concepts statement  using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements 
in addition  fin provides new disclosure requirements 
the disclosure requirements of fin were effective for the company as of december  the measurement and liability recognition provisions are applied prospectively to guarantees or modifications after december  the company anticipates that fin will not have a material impact on the financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
subject to certain criteria defined in the interpretation  fin will require consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities if the enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb the majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
the provisions of fin are effective immediately for interests acquired in variable interest entities after january   and at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june   for interests acquired in variable interest entities before february  for the company in the third quarter of 
the company is in the process of determining what impact  if any  the adoption of the provisions of fin will have upon its financial condition or results of operations 
certain transitional disclosures required by fin in all financial statements initially issued after january   have been included in the accompanying financial statements 
measures of member retention one of the major factors affecting the company s profitability and cash flow is the ability of the company to retain a membership  and therefore continue to receive fees  once it has been sold 
the company monitors its overall membership persistency rate  as well as the retention rates with respect to memberships sold by individual associates and agents and retention rates with respect to memberships by year of issue  geographic region  utilization characteristics and payment method  and other sub groupings 
terminology the following terms are used in describing the various measures of retention o membership life is a period that commences on the day of initial enrollment of a member and continues until the individual s membership eventually terminates or lapses the terms terminate or lapse may be used interchangeably here 
o membership age means the time since the membership has been in effect 
o lapse rate means the percentage of memberships of a specified group of memberships that lapse in a specified time period 
o retention rate is the complement of a lapse rate  and means the percentage of memberships of a specified group that remain in force at the end of a specified time period 
o persistency and retention are used in a general context to mean the tendency for memberships to continue to remain in force  while the term persistency rate is a specific measure that is defined below 
o lapse rates  retention rates  persistency rates  and expected membership life may be referred to as measures of membership retention 
o expected membership life means the average number of years a new membership is expected to remain in force 
o blended rate when used in reference to any measure of member retention means a rate computed across a mix of memberships of various membership ages 
o expected remaining membership life means the number of additional years that an existing member is expected to continue to renew from a specific point in time based on the membership life 
variations in membership retention by sub groups  impact on aggregate numbers company wide measures of membership retention include data relating to members who can potentially be further sorted by identifiable sub groupings 
for example  memberships may be subdivided into those owned by members who are or are not sales associates  to those who are or are not members of group plans  etc 
measures of membership retention of different sub groups may vary 
for example  the company s experience indicates that first year retention rate of memberships owned by members who also are sales associates is approximately better than retention of memberships owned by non associate members 
while this correlation can be identified  the cause and effect relationship here cannot be isolated 
these sales associate members may have a financial incentive to retain the membership in order to continue to receive commissions 
they also likely have a better understanding and appreciation of the benefits of the membership  which may have contributed in fact to their decision to also become a sales associate 
additionally  members who have accessed the services of the provider law firms historically have higher retention rates than those who have not 
all aggregate measures of membership retention or expected life may be impacted by shifts in the underlying enrollment mix of sub groups that have different retention rates 
for example memberships owned by non associate new members have comprised an increasing percentage of new memberships enrolled each year over the past five years 
since non associate members have a known lower first year retention rate  a shift in mix alone will cause a reduction in reported aggregate retention measures and expected member life  even if the retention rates within each sub group do not change 
it is important to note that all blended rates discussed here may reflect the impact of such shifts in enrollment mixes 
at december    of the active  memberships were also vested associates which represents of the total active memberships 
the following table shows total new memberships sold during each year and the number and percentage of memberships sold to persons who are associates 
total new associate year memberships memberships ratio variations in retention over life of a membership  impact on aggregate measures measures of member retention also vary significantly by the membership age 
historically  the company has observed that memberships in their first year have a significantly higher lapse rate than memberships in their second year  and so on 
the following chart shows the historical observed lapse rates and corresponding yearly retention rates as a function of membership age 
for example  of all new memberships lapse during the first year  leaving still in force at the end of the first year 
more tenured memberships have significantly lower lapse rates 
for example  by year seven lapse rates are under and annual retention exceeds 
the following table shows as of december  the company s blended retention rate and lapse rates based on its historical experience for the last years 
the blended retention and lapse rates as of the end of did not differ materially from those previously reported at the end of membership retention versus membership age membership yearly lapse yearly end of year year rate retention memberships membership persistency the company s membership persistency rate is a specific computation that measures the number of memberships in force at the end of a year as a percentage of the total of i memberships in force at the beginning of such year  plus ii new memberships sold during such year 
from through the year ended december   the company s annual membership persistency rates  using the foregoing method  have averaged approximately 
beginning new memberships ending year memberships total memberships persistency the company s overall membership persistency rate varies based on  among other factors  the relative age of total memberships in force  and shifts in the mix of members enrolled 
the company s overall membership persistency rate could become lower when the memberships in force include a higher proportion of newer memberships  as will happen following periods of rapid growth 
the company s overall membership persistency rate could also become lower when the new enrollments include a higher proportion of non associate members  a trend that has been observed over the past five years 
unless offset by other factors  these factors could result in a decline in the company s overall membership persistency rate as determined by the formula described above  but does not necessarily indicate that the new memberships written are less persistent 
expected membership life  expected remaining membership life using historical data through for all past members enrolled  the expected membership life can be computed to be approximately three years 
this number represents the average number of years a new membership can be expected to remain in force 
although about half of all new memberships may lapse in the first year  the expected membership life is much longer due to the contribution of higher annual retention rates in subsequent years 
since the company s experience is that the retention rate of a given generation of new memberships improves with membership age  the expected remaining membership life of a membership also increases with membership age 
for example  while a new membership may have an expected membership life of three years  the expected remaining membership life of a membership that reaches its first year anniversary is approximately five years 
since the actual population of memberships in force at any time is a distribution of ages from zero to more than years  the expected remaining membership life of the entire population at large greatly exceeds three years per membership 
as of december   based on the historical data described above  the current expected remaining membership life of the actual population is over six years per membership 
this measure is used by the company to estimate the future revenues expected from memberships currently in place 
expected membership life measures are based on more than years of historical membership retention data  unlike the membership persistency rate described above which is computed from  and determined by  the most recent one year period only 
both or these measures however include data from memberships of all membership ages and hence are referred to as blended measures 
actions that may impact retention in the future the potential impact on the company s future profitability and cash flow due to future changes in membership retention can be significant 
while blended retention rates have not changed significantly over the past five years  the company has recently taken actions that may impact retention rates in the future 
the company has implemented several new initiatives aimed at improving the retention rate of both new and existing memberships 
such initiatives include a revised compensation structure  effective march   featuring variable renewal commission rates ranging from five to per annum based on the month membership retention rate of the associate s personal sales and those of his organization  implementation of a non taken administrative fee to sales associates of for any membership application that is processed by the company after march   but for which a payment is never received  and  an increase in the amount of the commission charge back described above for memberships written after march  from of the unearned membership commission advance balance to of the unearned membership commission advance balance except during the months of december and march when the company waived chargebacks for associates that met certain criteria 
the company has designed and implemented an enhanced member life cycle communication process aimed at both increasing the overall amount of communication from the company to the members as well as more specific target messaging to members based on the length of their membership as well as utilization characteristics 
the company believes that such efforts may increase the utilization by members and therefore lead to higher retention rates 
the company s retention rates did not differ materially from and the company intends to continue to develop programs and initiatives designed to improve retention 
results of operations comparison of to the company reported net income applicable to common shares of million  or per diluted common share  for the net income per diluted share was up from net income applicable to common shares of million  or per diluted common share  for the increase in the net income applicable to common shares for is primarily the result of increases in membership fees for as compared to as well as a decrease in the weighted average number of shares outstanding of 
membership fees totaled million during compared to million for  an increase of 
membership fees and their impact on total revenues in any period are determined directly by the number of active memberships in force during any such period

risk factors there are a number of risk factors which could affect our financial condition or results of operations 
our future results may be adversely affected if membership persistency or renewal rates are lower than our historical experience 
the company has over years of actual historical experience to measure the expected retention of new members 
these retention rates could be adversely affected by the quality of services delivered by provider law firms  the existence of competitive products or services  the company s ability to provide administrative services to members or other factors 
if the company s membership persistency or renewal rates are less than the company has historically experienced  the company s cash flow  earnings and growth rates could be adversely affected 
the company may not be able to grow memberships and earnings at the same rate as it has historically experienced 
the company s year end active memberships have increased  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
net income applicable to common stockholders for the same three years has increased  and  respectively 
however  in the fourth quarter of  the company experienced its first decline in new memberships sold and associates recruited compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year 
the company s ability to grow memberships and earnings is substantially dependent upon its ability to expand or enhance the productivity of its sales force  develop additional legal expense products  develop alternative marketing methods or expand geographically 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to achieve increases in membership and earnings growth comparable to its historical growth rates 
the company is dependent upon the continued active participation of its principal executive officer 
the success of the company depends substantially on the continued active participation of its principal executive officer  harland c 
stonecipher 
although the company s management includes other individuals with significant experience in the business of the company  the loss of the services of mr 
stonecipher could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
there is litigation pending that may have a material adverse effect on the company if adversely determined 
see item legal proceedings 
the company is in a regulated industry and regulations could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to conduct its business 
the company is regulated by or required to file with or obtain approval of state insurance departments  state bar associations and state attorney general s offices  depending on individual state positions regarding regulatory responsibility for prepaid legal expense plans 
regulation of the company s activities is inconsistent among the various states in which the company does business with some states regulating legal expense plans as insurance or specialized legal expense products and others regulating such plans as services 
such disparate regulation requires the company to structure its memberships and operations differently in certain states in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations 
the company s multi level marketing strategy is also subject to us federal  canadian provincial and us state regulation under laws relating to consumer protection  pyramid sales  business opportunity  lotteries and multi level marketing 
changes in the regulatory environment for the company s business could increase the compliance costs the company incurs in order to conduct its business or limit the jurisdictions in which the company is able to conduct business 
the business in which the company operates is competitive 
there are a number of existing and potential competitors that have the ability to offer competing products that could adversely affect the company s ability to grow 
in addition  the company may face competition from a growing number of internet based legal sites with the potential to offer legal and related services at competitive prices 
increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
see description of business competition 
the company is dependent upon the success of its marketing force 
the company s principal method of product distribution is through multi level marketing 
the success of a multi level marketing force is highly dependent upon the company s ability to offer a commission and organizational structure and sales training and incentive program that enable sales associates to recruit and develop other sales associates to create an organization 
there are a number of other products and services that use multi level marketing as a distribution method and the company must compete with these organizations to recruit  maintain and grow its multi level marketing force 
in order to do so  the company may be required to increase its marketing costs through increases in commissions  sales incentives or other features  all of which could adversely affect the company s future earnings 
in addition  the level of confidence of the sales associates in the company s ability to perform is an important factor in maintaining and growing a multi level marketing force 
adverse financial developments concerning the company  including negative publicity or common stock price declines  could adversely affect the ability of the company to maintain the confidence of its sales force 
the company s stock price may be affected by the significant level of short sellers of the company s stock 
as of february   the new york stock exchange reported that approximately million shares of the company s stock were sold short  which constitutes approximately of the company s outstanding shares and of its public float  representing one of the largest short interest percentages of any new york stock exchange listed company 
short sellers expect to make a profit if the company s shares decline in value 
the company has been the subject of a negative publicity campaign from several known sources of information who support short sellers 
the existence of this short interest position may contribute to volatility in the company s stock price and may adversely affect the ability of the company s stock price to rise if market conditions or the company s performance would otherwise justify a price increase
