cumulative billed units for the fiscal year ended december  were  as compared to  for the same period in  a decline of 
these changes resulted in an increase in average copies per unit to  from  for the same period in this increase in average copies per unit is a result of active asset management designed to remove photocopiers from lower volume sites and to re deploy those machines into higher volume sites

additional accruals and deferrals of revenue can result when meter readings on newly installed or pulled machines do not coincide with the actual calendar month 
the company has adjusted its meter reading dates in order to more closely match meter readings with a complete calendar month in order to mitigate the need for accruals and deferrals going forward 
revenues from the company s atm business increased to million during from million in the company experienced this significant increase in atm revenues due to increases in the company s base of installed atm units of approximately on a consolidated basis and an asset management strategy that included moving atms from low transaction volume sites to higher volume sites

sales discounts are greater in the photocopy business than in the atm business and generally vary at individual retail businesses depending on volume the higher the volume  the greater the discount 
sales discounts as a percentage of sales in were as compared to in the increase as a percentage of sales is primarily due to a shift in the atm industry toward higher discount programs that allow the retailer to retain a larger portion of the revenue

the software development portion of the business that was retained by the company contributed million or of contributed revenue in the decrease in selling  general  and administrative costs associated with iatmglobal 
net was partially offset by a million increase in non labor related expenses in the company s other businesses 
these include a  increase in expense for value added tax vat in the united kingdom atm business 
of this amount  approximately  had been capitalized since the inception of the atm business and  had been recorded as vat receivable in that was subsequently determined to be non reclaimable 
the remainder was vat expense related to fiscal year in the company received a final determination from uk taxing authorities as to the applicability and method of calculating vat associated with its atm business which resulted in the need to record additional expense 
prior to  the treatment of vat related to the atm business could not be reasonably determined or estimated since non bank atm placements were relatively new to the united kingdom and the taxing authority had not yet provided guidance as to their tax treatment 
an additional  related to non recurring expense was recorded in anticipation of renewing the company s fleet leases earlier than originally planned

in the fourth quarter of  the company determined that certain of its mita analog photocopiers held in storage would not likely be returned to service  and  representing the net book value of these copiers was charged to expense 
in conjunction with the company s commitment to purchase an additional konica photocopy machines during  year over year declines in photocopy transaction volumes  and limited opportunities for large scale expansion  the company determined that the market no longer supported plans to redeploy older technology photocopiers

the company entered into capital leases on equipment in and interest expense related to these capital leases for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
as such  in fiscal year  the decline in both the line of credit outstanding balance and interest rates  offset partially by an increase in capital lease interest  resulted in an overall reduced interest expense compared to fiscal year in october the company incurred a million loss on the disposal of the assets of its french operations

total copy volume for the fiscal year ended december  was billion copies as compared to billion copies for the same period in  a decline of 
cumulative billed units for the fiscal year ended december  were  as compared to  for the same period in  a decline of 
these changes resulted in an increase in average copies per unit to  from  for the same period in this increase in average copies per unit is a result of active asset management designed to remove photocopiers from lower volume sites and to re deploy those machines into higher volume sites 
due to the timing of installations  removals  or maintenance during any given billing period  billed units may be slightly less than the average number of units installed during a billing period 
the differences in units billed and average units installed during a billing period does not result in material timing differences 
revenues from the company s atm business increased to million during from million in the company experienced this significant increase in atm revenues due to increases in the company s base of installed atm units of approximately on a consolidated basis and an asset management strategy that included moving atms from low transaction volume sites to higher volume sites

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
interest rate risk 
the company maintains an investment portfolio that is comprised solely of money market funds 
the income earned from these money market funds is subject to changes in interest rates 
for the years ended december  and  interest income amounted to  and  respectively 
an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s net income 
additionally  the company is exposed to interest rate risk related to its credit facility 
advances against the credit facility periodically renew  at which point the borrowings are subject to the then current market interest rates  which may differ from the rates the company is currently paying on its borrowings 
total debt outstanding under the company s line of credit was million and million at december  and  respectively 
total interest expense relative to these borrowings was million and million for and  respectively  at average interest rates of and  respectively 
if interest rates had increased by basis points for each of those years  interest expense would have increased by approximately  and  for and  respectively 
foreign currency risk 
the company has international subsidiaries subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
the company pays the expenses of its international operations in local currencies  namely  the british pound and canadian dollar 
the international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as they relate to revenues and operating expenses as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
because exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
to date  the company s exposure to exchange rate volatility has not been significant 
foreign exchange rate transaction losses  net of gains for the years ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively 
if foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by from rates at december  and december   the company s financial position would be materially affected 
assuming a appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december   the potential change in the fair value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities in each entity would aggregate approximately million 
no assurance can be given that changes in foreign currency rates will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
the company does not hold or issue derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes
