investment securities available for sale 
at december   new valley had investment securities available for sale of  new valley classifies investments in debt and marketable equity securities as either available for sale or held to maturity

long term investments 
at december   new valley had long term investments of  representing investments in various limited partnerships

income taxes

new valley s losses during these and prior years have generated federal tax net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards of approximately  as of december  and capital loss carryforwards of  which expire at various dates from through generally accepted accounting principles require that new valley record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with these loss carryforwards if it is more likely than not that new valley will not be able to utilize it to offset future taxes 
due to the size of the loss carryforwards in relation to new valley s history of unprofitable operations and to the continuing uncertainties surrounding its operations as it seeks to acquire additional operating companies  new valley has not recognized any of this net deferred tax asset 
new valley currently provides for income taxes only to the extent that it expects to pay cash taxes primarily state taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax for current income 
it is possible  however  that new valley could be profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize all or a portion of the carryforwards 
upon reaching such a conclusion  new valley would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to its combined federal and state effective rates  which would approximate under current tax rates  rather than the nominal rate currently being used 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause new valley s provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although its cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the loss carryforwards is utilized
