item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item business 
we design  manufacture and market capital equipment  packaging materials and test interconnect products as well as service  maintain  repair and upgrade equipment  all used to assemble and or test semiconductor devices 
we also provide semiconductor wafer bumping services flip chip bumping and licensing of our bumping process to semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontractors 
we are currently the world s leading supplier of semiconductor wire bonding assembly equipment  according to vlsi research  inc our business is currently divided into four product segments equipment  packaging materials  wafer and package test interconnect products  and advanced packaging technology 
in november  the company announced its intentions to divest its operations of the advanced packaging segment 
the semiconductor industry has been historically volatile  with periods of rapid growth followed by industry wide retrenchment 
one such downturn started in fiscal and has persisted into fiscal in response to this downturn the company has shifted its strategy  focusing on our larger more established product lines  and divesting or discontinuing smaller or more speculative businesses 
additionally  we have been actively reducing the company s cost structure both by moving operations to lower cost areas and by downsizing 
our goal is to be both the technology leader  and the lowest cost supplier in each of our major lines of business 
based on increased order activity starting late in fiscal  as well as other factors we believe the semiconductor industry is entering a growth cycle 
there can be no assurances about either the duration or vigor of this cycle  and in any case  we believe the historical volatility both upward and downward will persist 
we believe we are the only major supplier to the semiconductor assembly industry that can provide customers with semiconductor wire bonding equipment along with the complimentary packaging materials and test interconnect products that actually contact the surface of the customer s semiconductor devices 
we believe that the ability to control all of these assembly related products provides us with a significant competitive advantage and should allow us to develop system solutions to the new technology challenges inherent in assembling and packaging next generation semiconductor devices

products and services we offer a range of wire bonding equipment and spare parts  packaging materials  test interconnect products  and flip chip bumping services used in various semiconductor assembly processes 
set forth below is a table listing the net sales and percentage of our total net sales for each business segment for our fiscal years ended september    and dollars in thousands fiscal year ended september  of total of total of total net sales net sales net sales net sales net sales net sales equipment packaging materials test interconnect advanced packaging technologies in the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired two test interconnect companies  cerprobe corporation and probe technology corporation  creating our test interconnect segment 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we closed the substrate business that was part of the advanced packaging technology segment 
that business was a startup and had no revenue 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold the assets related to the saw and hard material blade businesses that were part of the equipment segment and packaging materials segment  respectively 
those businesses had fiscal revenue of million 
as the above chart indicates  our equipment sales are highly volatile  based on the semiconductor industry s need for new capability and capacity  whereas packaging materials and test interconnect sales in general tend to be more stable  following the trend of total semiconductor unit production 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for financial results by business segment 
equipment our principal equipment product line is our family of wire bonders  which are used to connect very fine wires  typically made of gold  aluminum or copper  between the bond pads of a semiconductor die and the leads on the integrated circuit ic package to which the die has been attached 
we offer both ball and wedge type wire bonders in automatic and manual configurations 
automatic ic ball bonders represent a large majority of our wire bonder business 
we believe that our wire bonders offer competitive advantages by providing customers with high productivity throughput and superior package quality process control 
especially important is the machine s ability to perform very fine pitch bonding as well as create the sophisticated wire loop shapes which are needed in the assembly of today s advanced semiconductor packages 
the largest portion of our wire bonder revenue comes from the sale of ic ball bonders 
as part of our competitive strategy  we have been introducing new models of ic ball bonders every to months  with each new model designed to increase both productivity and process capability as compared to its predecessor 
in may  we began marketing the maxum  our latest generation ic ball bonder  which offers up to more productivity than its predecessor 
in december  we plan to introduce the maxum plus to customers offering further productivity increases  as well as process capability improvements 
in addition  in january of  we began shipping the nu tek  a new automatic wire bonder optimized for low lead count ic s and discrete device applications  which are both segments of the market where we had not previously participated 

table of contents we also produce other models of wire bonders  targeted at specific market niches  including the model  a large area ball bonder designed for wire bonding hybrid  chip on board  and other large area applications  the waferpro  for wafer level bumping for flip chip and other area array applications  the triton rda  a wedge bonder designed for ribbon bonding  the model and model wedge bonders  and the series of manual wire bonders 
as part of our efforts to reduce the cost of our wire bonders  we transferred our automatic ball bonder manufacturing from willow grove  pennsylvania to singapore in fiscal further cost reductions were achieved in fiscal by integrating a china based supply chain 
in response to customer trends in outsourcing packaging requirements  we provide repair and maintenance services  a variety of equipment upgrades  machine and component rebuild activities and expanded customer training through a customer operations group 
packaging materials we manufacture and market a range of semiconductor packaging materials and expendable tools for the semiconductor assembly market  including very fine gold  aluminum and copper wire  capillaries  wedges  die collets and saw blades  all of which are used in packaging and assembly processes 
our packaging materials are designed for use on both our own and our competitors assembly equipment 
a wire bonder uses a capillary or wedge tool and bonding wire much like a sewing machine uses a needle and thread 
our principal products are bonding wire 
we manufacture very fine gold  aluminum and copper wire used in the wire bonding process 
this wire is bonded to the chip surface and package substrate by the wire bonder and becomes a permanent part of the customers semiconductor package 
we produce wire to a wide range of specifications  which can satisfy most wire bonding applications across the spectrum of semiconductor packages 
expendable tools 
our expendable tools include a large variety of capillaries  wedges  die collets and wafer saw blades 
the capillaries and wedges actually attach the wire to the semiconductor chip  allow a precise amount of wire to be paid out to form a permanent wire loop  then attach the wire to the package substrate  and finally cut the wire so that the bonding process can be repeated again 
die collets are used to pick up and place die into packages before the wire bonding process 
our hub blades are used to cut silicon wafers into individual semiconductor die 
test interconnect we offer a broad range of fixtures used to temporarily contact a semiconductor device while it is still in the wafer format wafer probing thereby providing electrical connections to automatic test equipment 
we also offer test sockets used to test the final semiconductor package package or final testing 
our principal test interconnect products are probe cards 
a probe card consists of a complex  multilayer printed circuit board pcb upon which are attached numerous probe needles designed to make temporary contact to each of the bond pads or bumps on a die while it is still in a wafer format  thereby providing electrical connections to automatic test equipment 
automatic test equipment ate interface assemblies 
an ate interface assembly  sometimes called a space transformer  typically consists of mechanical docking hardware and an intricate  multilayer pcb  which mechanically connects ate equipment to a wafer prober  carrying electrical signals to a probe card  and ultimately to the semiconductor device under test 
ate test boards 
an ate test board is a complex  multilayer pcb that mounts directly to ate equipment and transfers electrical signals from the ate to the test socket 
test sockets 
a socket holds a packaged semiconductor device while making electrical connections to the device leads through spring loaded contacts 

table of contents changes in the design of a semiconductor device often require changes in the probe card  test socket and  in certain cases  the ate test board used to test that semiconductor 
customers generally purchase new versions of these custom designed products each time there is a design change in the semiconductor being tested 
changes in semiconductor design and processes drive improvements in test interconnect technology in order to support significant increases in the number and density of bond pads or leads being tested and the speed of the electrical signals being tested 
examples of the new families of probe cards we have introduced include the duraplus and advanced epoxy products 
advanced packaging technologies since the closure of our substrate business in august   our advanced packaging technologies segment consists solely of our flip chip business 
our flip chip business unit focuses primarily on licensing its flip chip technology and providing flip chip bumping and wafer level packaging services to customers 
in february  we entered into a joint venture agreement with delco electronic corporation delco to license flip chip technology and to provide wafer bumping services on a contract basis 
in march  we purchased all of delco s interest in the flip chip venture not previously owned by us 
we are currently providing contract bump services to approximately customers 
we also developed and market a wafer level package  named the ultracsp  which is in production and has been licensed to customers 
in september  we introduced spheron  a wafer level package technology that expands the capability and performance of our wafer level package product 
as of september   we had sold nine licenses for wafer solder bumping and wafer level packaging applications 
our flip chip business unit has not been profitable to date and we announced our intention to divest this business unit in november  customers our major customers include large semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems 
some of these major customers are semiconductor manufacturers semiconductor assemblers vertically integrated manufacturers advanced micro devices advanced semiconductor engineering ibm agere amkor technologies motorola conexant chippac nec international infineon technologies orient semiconductor electronics philips electronics intel siliconware precision industries co  ltd samsung lsi logic seagate micron national semiconductor st microelectronics texas instruments 
table of contents these customers sometimes vary year to year based on their capital investment and operating expense budgets 
the chart below shows the company s top ten end use customers for each of the last three fiscal years fiscal fiscal fiscal texas instruments advanced semiconductor engineering advanced semiconductor engineering st microelectronics st microelectronics st microelectronics micron siliconware precision industries ltd intel advanced semiconductor eng 
intel amkor technologies intel texas instruments texas instruments infineon technologies infineon technologies infineon technologies lexmark amkor technologies national semiconductor amkor technologies national semiconductor philips electronics philips electronics samsung st assembly test agere philips electronics siliconware precision industries ltd we believe that developing long term relationships with our customers is critical to our success 
by establishing these relationships with semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor subcontract assemblers  and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems  we gain insight into our customers future ic packaging strategies 
this information assists us in our efforts to develop material  equipment and process solutions that address our customers future assembly requirements 
international operations we sell our products to semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor subcontract assemblers  and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems  which are primarily located in or have operations in the asia pacific region 
approximately of our fiscal net sales  of our fiscal net sales  and of our fiscal net sales were for delivery to customer locations outside of the united states 
the majority of these foreign sales were destined for customer locations in the asia pacific region  including taiwan  malaysia  singapore  korea  japan  and the philippines 
our shipments to customers in china have historically been a small portion of our sales  however  we expect this portion to increase as some of our customers increase their production capacity in china 
we expect sales outside of the united states to continue to represent a majority of our future revenues 
similarly  a majority of our manufacturing operations are also in countries other than the us  including major manufacturing operations located in singapore  israel  and china with other smaller facilities in france  japan  scotland  switzerland and taiwan 
risks associated with our international operations include risks of foreign currency and foreign financial market fluctuations  international exchange restrictions  changing political conditions and monetary policies of foreign governments  war  civil disturbances  expropriation  and other events that may limit or disrupt markets 
sales and customer support through the end of fiscal we operated a single sales management team to coordinate global activities and provide local support in each country where our customers are located 
our country and regional managers rely on a combination of a direct sales force  manufacturers representatives and distributors for the sale of our various product lines 
we believe that providing comprehensive worldwide sales  service  training and support are important competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment industry  and we have managed these functions as a global customer operations group 
in order to support our customers  whose semiconductor assembly operations are located primarily outside of the united states  we have sales  service  and support personnel based in china  hong kong  japan  korea  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  taiwan  and europe with applications labs in singapore  japan  israel  taiwan  and germany 
our local presence enables us to provide timely customer service and support by positioning our service representatives and spare parts near customer facilities  and affords customers the ability to place orders locally and to deal with service and support personnel who speak the customer s language and are familiar with local country practices 

table of contents subsequent to the end of fiscal we reorganized some of these customer operations along product lines with one group focused on wire bonder related products  and another on test related products 
backlog at september   our backlog of orders approximated million  compared to approximately million at september   and million at june our backlog consists of customer orders  which are scheduled for shipment within months 
our customer order to sale cycle is relatively short with quarter ending backlog typically representing of the succeeding quarter s net sales 
virtually all orders are subject to cancellation  deferral or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalties 
because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellations and potential delays in product shipments  our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of future revenues 
manufacturing the company believes excellence in manufacturing can create competitive advantage  both through lower costs  and superior responsiveness 
in order to achieve these goals  we manage our manufacturing operations through a single organization  and are trending to fewer  larger factories taking advantage of economies of scale and the cost savings available in low labor cost areas 
equipment 
our equipment manufacturing activities consist primarily of integrating outsourced parts and subassemblies  and testing the finished product to customer specifications 
during fiscal most equipment manufacturing took place in singapore  with small numbers of machines built in willow grove  pennsylvania  and haifa  israel which was sold in august 
we believe the outsourcing model enables us to minimize our fixed costs and capital expenditures and allows us to focus on product differentiation through technology innovations in system design and manufacturing quality control 
just in time inventory management has reduced our manufacturing cycle times and limited our on hand inventory 
we have obtained iso certification for our equipment manufacturing facilities in willow grove  pennsylvania  singapore and haifa  israel 
packaging materials 
we manufacture expendable tools at facilities in yokneam  israel and suzhou  china  and bonding wire at facilities in singapore and thalwil  switzerland 
we manufacture blades for wafer sawing in santa clara  california 
the bonding wire facility in switzerland has received iso certification  the bonding wire facility in singapore has received qs and iso certifications  the blade facility in california has received iso certification  the bonding tools facility  in yokneam  israel has received iso and iso certifications  and the bonding tools facility in suzhou  china has received iso and iso certifications 
test interconnect products 
we manufacture test probe cards in various facilities located in gilbert  arizona  hayward and san jose  california  hsin chu  taiwan  e 
kilbride  scotland  singapore  and corbeil and meyreuil  france 
we plan to begin manufacturing test probe cards in suzhou  china in fiscal ate interface assemblies are manufactured in gilbert  arizona and test sockets in hayward  california and singapore 
as part of our ongoing cost reduction activities  the company closed the ate test board facility in dallas  texas in the third quarter of fiscal  moving to an outsource strategy for this product line 
advanced packaging technology 
we maintain a manufacturing facility in phoenix  arizona for our flip chip business unit 
our flip chip manufacturing facility has received qs certification 
research and product development many of our customers generate technology roadmaps describing the future manufacturing capability requirements needed to support their product development plans 
our research and product development activities are organized so that our products anticipate our customers requirements 
this can happen  either through continuous improvement of our existing products  including upgrades for products already installed in customers facilities  or through the creation of next generation products 
examples of continuous improvement include the nutek and maxum plus wire bonders mentioned above both improvements of the maxum our advanced epoxy line of probe cards  and our duracap line of bonding tools 
a major next 
table of contents generation wire bonder effort is also underway  with that product scheduled for launch in late whether the company proceeds via continuous improvement  or via next generation technology development  our goal is technology leadership in each of our major product lines 
our net expenditures for research and development totaled approximately million  million  and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
we have received funding from certain customers and government agencies pursuant to specific contracts or other arrangements for the performance of specified research and development activities 
such amounts are recognized as a reduction of research and development expense when specified activities have been performed 
during the fiscal years ended september    and  such funding totaled approximately thousand  thousand  and million  respectively 
competition the market for semiconductor equipment  packaging materials  and test interconnect products is intensely competitive 
significant competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment market include speed throughput  production yield  customer support  and price  which all contribute to lower the overall cost per package being manufactured 
our major equipment competitors include wire bonders asm pacific technology and shinkawa competitive factors in the semiconductor packaging materials industry include performance  price  delivery  life of the product  and quality 
our significant packaging materials competitors include bonding tools gaiser tool co  small precision tools  inc and peco saw blades disco corporation bonding wire tanaka electronic industries  sumitomo metal mining  heraeus  and nippon metal 
the test products face competition from a few large international firms as well as many small regional firms 
our significant competitors include wafer test japan electronic materials  formfactor  inc  and micronics package test everett charles technologies  yamaichi  johnstech  and synergetix our flip chip competitors include unitive and chipbond in each of the markets we serve  we face competition and the threat of competition from established competitors and potential new entrants  a few of which may have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than we have 
some of these competitors are asian and european companies that have had and may continue to have an advantage over us in supplying products to local customers because many of these customers appear to prefer to purchase from local suppliers  without regard to other considerations 
intellectual property where circumstances warrant  we seek to obtain patents on inventions governing new products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research  engineering and manufacturing activities 
we currently hold a number of united states patents  some of which have foreign counterparts 
we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the life cycles of the technologies disclosed and claimed in the patents 
although the patents we hold or may obtain in the future may be of value  we believe that our success will depend primarily on our engineering  manufacturing  marketing and service skills 

table of contents in addition  we believe that much of our important technology resides in our trade secrets and proprietary software 
as long as we rely on trade secrets and unpatented knowledge  including software  to maintain our competitive position  there is no assurance that competitors may not independently develop similar technologies and possibly obtain patents containing claims applicable to our products and processes 
our ability to defend ourselves against these claims may be limited 
in addition  although we execute non disclosure and non competition agreements with certain of our employees  customers  consultants  selected vendors and others  there is no assurance that such secrecy agreements will not be breached  or that they can be enforced 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  use  emission  discharge  transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the health and safety of our employees 
in addition  we are subject to environmental laws which may require investigation and cleanup of any contamination at facilities we own or operate or at third party waste disposal sites we use or have used 
these laws could impose liability even if we did not know of  or were not responsible for  the contamination 
we have in the past and will in the future incur costs to comply with environmental laws 
we are not  however  currently aware of any costs or liabilities relating to environmental matters  including any claims or actions under environmental laws or obligations to perform any cleanups at any of our facilities or any third party waste disposal sites  that we expect to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
it is possible  however  that material environmental costs or liabilities may arise in the future 
employees at september   we had  permanent employees and temporary employees worldwide  down from  employees a year earlier 
the only employees represented by a labor union are the bonding wire employees in singapore 
generally  we believe our employee relations to be good 
competition in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry is intense  particularly with respect to software engineering 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management  marketing and technical employees

introduction we design  manufacture and market capital equipment  packaging materials and test interconnect products as well as service  maintain  repair and upgrade equipment  all used to assemble semiconductor devices 
we also provide semiconductor wafer bumping services flip chip bumping and license of our bumping process to semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontractors 
today  we are the world s leading supplier of semiconductor wire bonding assembly equipment  according to vlsi research  inc our business is currently divided into four product segments equipment  packaging materials  wafer and package test interconnect products  and advanced packaging technology 
in november  the company announced its intentions to divest its operations of the advanced packaging segment 
the semiconductor industry has been historically volatile  with periods of rapid growth followed by industry wide retrenchment 
one such downturn started in fiscal  and has persisted into fiscal in response to this downturn the company has shifted its strategy  focusing on our larger more established product lines  and divesting or discontinuing smaller or more speculative businesses 
additionally  we have been actively reducing the company s cost structure both by moving operations to lower cost areas and by downsizing 
our goal is to be both the technology leader  and the lowest cost supplier  in each of our major lines of business 
based on increased order activity starting late in fiscal  as well as other factors we believe the semiconductor industry is entering a growth cycle 
there can be no assurances about either the duration or vigor of this cycle  and in any case  we believe the historical volatility both upward and downward will persist 
products and services we offer a range of wire bonding equipment and spare parts  packaging materials  test interconnect products  and flip chip bumping services used in various semiconductor assembly processes 
set forth below is a table listing the net sales and percentage of our total net sales for each business segment for our fiscal years ended september    and 
table of contents dollars in thousands fiscal year ended september  of total of total of total net sales net sales net sales net sales net sales net sales equipment packaging materials test interconnect advanced packaging technologies in the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired two test interconnect companies  cerprobe corporation and probe technology corporation  creating our test interconnect segment 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we closed the substrate business that was part of the advanced packaging technology segment 
that business was a startup and had no revenue 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold the assets related to the saw and hard material blade businesses that were part of the equipment segment and packaging materials segment  respectively 
those businesses had fiscal revenue of million 
as the above chart indicates  our equipment sales are highly volatile  based on the semiconductor industry s need for new capability and capacity  whereas packaging materials and test interconnect sales tend to be more stable  following the trend of total semiconductor unit production 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for financial results by business segment 
equipment our principal equipment product line is our family of wire bonders  which are used to connect very fine wires  typically made of gold  aluminum or copper  between the bond pads of a semiconductor die and the leads on the integrated circuit ic package to which the die has been attached 
we offer both ball and wedge type wire bonders in automatic and manual configurations 
automatic ic ball bonders represent a large majority of our wire bonder business 
we believe that our wire bonders offer competitive advantages by providing customers with high productivity throughput and superior package quality process control 
especially important is the machine s ability to perform very fine pitch bonding as well as create the sophisticated wire loop shapes which are needed in the assembly of today s advanced semiconductor packages 
the largest portion of our wire bonder revenue comes from the sale of ic ball bonders 
as part of our competitive strategy  we have been introducing new models of ic ball bonders every to months  with each new model designed to increase both productivity and process capability as compared to its predecessor 
in may  we began marketing the maxum  our latest generation ic ball bonder  which offers up to more productivity than its predecessor 
in december  we plan to introduce the maxum plus to customers offering further productivity increases  as well as process capability improvements 
in addition  in january of  we began shipping the nu tek  a new automatic wire bonder optimized for low lead count ic s and discrete device applications  which are both segments of the market where we had not previously participated 
we also produce other models of wire bonders  targeted at specific market niches  including the model  a large area ball bonder designed for wire bonding hybrid  chip on board  and other large area applications  the waferpro  for wafer level bumping for flip chip and other area array applications  the triton rda  a wedge bonder designed for ribbon bonding  the model and model wedge bonders  and the series of manual wire bonders 
as part of our efforts to reduce the cost of our wire bonders  we transferred our automatic ball bonder manufacturing from willow grove  pennsylvania to singapore in fiscal further cost reductions were achieved in fiscal by integrating chinese vendors into our supply chain 

table of contents in response to customer trends in outsourcing packaging requirements  we provide repair and maintenance services  a variety of equipment upgrades  machine and component rebuild activities and expanded customer training through a customer operations group 
packaging materials we manufacture and market a range of semiconductor packaging materials and expendable tools for the semiconductor assembly market  including very fine gold  aluminum and copper wire  capillaries  wedges  die collets and saw blades  all of which are used in packaging and assembly processes 
our packaging materials are designed for use on both our own and our competitors assembly equipment 
a wire bonder uses a capillary or wedge tool and bonding wire much like an automatic sewing machine uses a needle and thread 
our principal products are bonding wire 
we manufacture very fine gold  aluminum and copper wire used in the wire bonding process 
this wire is bonded to the chip surface and package substrate by the wire bonder and becomes a permanent part of the customers semiconductor package 
we produce wire to a wide range of specifications  which can satisfy most wire bonding applications across the spectrum of semiconductor packages 
expendable tools 
our expendable tools include a large variety of capillaries  wedges  die collets and wafer saw blades 
the capillaries and wedges actually attach the wire to the semiconductor chip  allow a precise amount of wire to be paid out to form a permanent wire loop  then attach the wire to the package substrate  and finally cut the wire so that the bonding process can be repeated again 
die collets are used to pick up and place die into packages before the wire bonding process 
our hub blades are used to cut silicon wafers into individual semiconductor die 
test interconnect we offer a broad range of fixtures used to temporarily contact a semiconductor device while it is still in the wafer format wafer probing thereby providing electrical connections to automatic test equipment 
we also offer test sockets used to test the final semiconductor package package or final testing 
our principal test interconnect products are probe cards 
a probe card consists of a complex  multilayer printed circuit board pcb upon which are attached numerous probe needles designed to make temporary contact to each of the bond pads or bumps on a die while it is still in a wafer format  thereby providing electrical connections to automatic test equipment 
automatic test equipment ate interface assemblies 
an ate interface assembly  sometimes called a space transformer  typically consists of mechanical docking hardware and an intricate  multilayer pcb  which mechanically connects ate equipment to a wafer prober  carrying electrical signals to a probe card  and ultimately to the semiconductor device under test 
ate test boards 
an ate test board is a complex  multilayer pcb that mounts directly to ate equipment and transfers electrical signals from the ate to the test socket 
test sockets 
a socket holds a packaged semiconductor device while making electrical connections to the device leads through spring loaded contacts 
changes in the design of a semiconductor device often requires changes in the probe card  test socket and  in certain cases  the ate test board used to test that semiconductor 
customers generally purchase new versions of these custom designed products each time there is a design change in the semiconductor being tested 
changes in semiconductor design and processes drive improvements in test interconnect technology in order to support significant increases in the number and density of bond pads or leads being tested and the speed of the electrical signals being tested 
examples of the new families of probe cards we have introduced include the duraplus and advanced epoxy products 

table of contents advanced packaging technologies since the closure of our substrate business in august   our advanced packaging technologies segment consists solely of our flip chip business 
our flip chip business unit focuses primarily on licensing its flip chip technology and providing flip chip bumping and wafer level packaging services to customers 
in february  we entered into a joint venture agreement with delco electronic corporation delco to license flip chip technology and to provide wafer bumping services on a contract basis 
in march  we purchased all of delco s interest in the flip chip venture not previously owned by us 
we own of flip chip 
we are currently providing contract bump services to approximately customers 
we also developed and market a wafer level package  named the ultracsp  which is in production and has been licensed to customers 
in september  we introduced spheron  a wafer level package technology that expands the capability and performance of our wafer level package product 
as of september   we had sold nine licenses for wafer solder bumping and wafer level packaging applications 
our flip chip business unit has not been profitable to date and we announced our intention to divest this business unit in november  critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following accounting policy is critical to the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
we changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal  effective october   based upon guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  the collectibility is reasonably assured  and we have satisfied any equipment installation obligations and received customer acceptance  or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations 
in the event terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period  we recognize revenue based upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance  whichever occurs first 
our standard terms are ex works k s factory  with title transferring to our customer at our loading dock or upon embarkation 
we do have a small percentage of sales with other terms  and revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the related customer purchase order 
revenue related to services is generally recognized upon performance of the services requested by a customer order 
revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a term more than one month is recognized on a prorated straight line basis over the term of the contract 
revenue from royalty arrangements and license agreements is recognized in accordance with the contract terms  generally prorated over the life of the contract or based upon specific deliverables 
our business is subject to contingencies related to customer orders as follows right of return a large portion of our revenue comes from the sale of machines that are used in the semiconductor assembly process 
these items are generally built to order  and often include customization to a customer s specifications 
revenue related to the semiconductor equipment is recognized upon customer acceptance 
other product sales relate to consumable products  which are sold in high volume quantities  and are generally maintained at low stock levels at our customer s facility 
as a result  customer returns represent a very small percentage of customer sales on an annual basis 
our policy is to provide an allowance for customer returns based upon our historical experience and management assumptions 
warranties our products are generally shipped with a one year warranty against manufacturer s defects and we do not offer extended warranties in the normal course of our business 
we recognize a liability for estimated warranty expense when revenue for the related product is recognized 
the estimated liability for warranty is based upon historical experience and management estimates of future expenses 
conditions of acceptance sales of our consumable products and bonding wire generally do not have customer acceptance terms 
in certain cases  sales of our equipment products do have customer acceptance clauses which 
table of contents generally require that the equipment perform in accordance with specifications during an on site factory inspection by the customer  as well as when installed at the customer s facility 
in such cases  if the terms of acceptance are satisfied at our facility prior to shipment  the revenue for the equipment will be recognized upon shipment 
if the customer must first install the equipment in their own factory  then generally  revenue associated with that sale is not recognized until acceptance is received from the customer 
price protection we do not provide price protection to our customers 
before we adopted sab  we recorded revenue upon the shipment of products or the performance of services 
provisions for estimated product returns  warranty and installation costs were accrued in the period in which the revenue was recognized 
this policy assumed customer acceptance when the product specifications were met and the products shipped 
product returns and disputes with customers due to dissatisfaction with the performance of our products have been immaterial  accordingly  we recognized revenue upon the transfer of title and did not require our customers to provide notice of acceptance 
generally accepted accounting principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the more significant areas involving the use of estimates in these financial statements include allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  carrying value and lives of fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  self insurance reserves  pension benefit liabilities  resizing  warranty  litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which are the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies require significant judgements and estimates allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we are also subject to concentrations of customers and sales to a few geographic locations  which may also impact the collectability of certain receivables 
if economic or political conditions were to change in the countries where we do business  it could have a significant impact on the results of our operations  and our ability to realize the full value of our accounts receivable 
our average write off of bad debts over the past five fiscal years has been less than inventory reserves 
we generally provide reserves for equipment inventory and spare part and consumable inventories considered to be in excess of months of forecasted future demand 
the forecasted demand is based upon internal projections  historical sales volumes  customer order activity and a review of consumable inventory levels at our customers facilities 
we communicate forecasts of our future demand to our suppliers and adjust commitments to those suppliers accordingly 
if required  we reduce the carrying value of our inventory to the lower of cost or market value  based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions and the next cyclical market upturn 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we review and dispose of excess and obsolete inventory on a regular basis 
valuation of long lived assets 
our long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets 
our property  plant and equipment and intangible assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets is based upon our estimates of future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we manage and value our intangible technology assets in the aggregate  as one asset group  not by individual technology 
we perform our annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  which coincides with our annual planning process 
our annual impairment testing resulted in an impairment charge of million in fiscal in our flip chip business unit and a fiscal impairment charge of million in the test business unit and million in the hub blade business 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment 
table of contents charges in accordance with sfas and sfas deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we expect is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
in fiscal and we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets generated from our us net operating losses 
as the company generates additional us net operating loss carryforwards  additional valuation allowances are set up against these deferred tax assets 
overview net sales 
our equipment sales depend on the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers worldwide which  in turn  depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and technology driven advancements in semiconductor design 
the semiconductor industry historically has been highly volatile  and has experienced periodic downturns and slowdowns  which have had a severe negative effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment 
for example  a downturn in the semiconductor industry from fiscal through most of fiscal contributed to lower net sales in each of those fiscal years in comparison to our fiscal net sales  during which time the semiconductor industry was experiencing an upturn 
our packaging materials sales depend on manufacturing expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers  many of which also purchase our equipment products 
however  the volatility in demand for our packaging materials is less than that of our equipment sales due to the consumable nature of these products 
our test interconnect solutions sales depend on the manufacturing expenditures of some of the same semiconductor manufacturers and subcontractors as our equipment and packaging materials sales 
because of the consumable and customized nature of most of our test products  however  the volatility in demand for these test products is less than that of our equipment sales 
our advanced packaging technology sales represent the sales from our flip chip business unit 
cost of goods sold 
equipment cost of goods sold consists mainly of subassemblies  materials  direct and indirect labor costs and other overhead 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture many of the components and subassemblies for our products and we rely on sole source suppliers for some material components 
packaging materials cost of goods sold consists primarily of gold  aluminum  direct labor and other materials used in the manufacture of bonding wire  capillaries  wedges and other company products  with gold making up the majority of the cost 
gold bonding wire is generally priced based on a fabrication charge per  feet of wire  plus the value of the gold 
to minimize our exposure to gold price fluctuations  we obtain gold for fabrication under a contract with our gold supplier on consignment and only purchase the gold when we ship the finished product to the customer 
accordingly  fluctuations in the price of gold are generally absorbed by our gold supplier or passed on to our customers 
since gold makes up a significant portion of the cost of goods sold of the bonding wire business unit  the gross profit margins of that business unit and therefore the packaging materials segment will be lower than can be expected in the equipment business 
we rely on one supplier for our gold requirements 
test interconnect cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct labor  indirect labor for engineering design and materials used in the manufacture of wafer and ic package testing cards and devices 
cost of goods sold in our advanced packaging technology segment is comprised of material  labor and overhead at our flip chip division 
selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expense is comprised primarily of personnel and related costs  professional costs  and depreciation expense 

table of contents research and development expense 
our research and development costs consist primarily of labor  prototype material and other costs associated with our developmental efforts to strengthen our product lines and develop new products and depreciation expense 
for example  in fiscal  we began shipping the nu tek  a new automatic wire bonder designed for low lead applications  a segment of the market we had not previously targeted 
included in research and development expense is the cost to develop the software that operates our semiconductor assembly equipment  which is expensed as incurred 
our research and development costs decreased in fiscal as a result of the resizing of our business 
however  we expect to continue to incur significant research and development costs 
results of operations the table below shows principal line items from our historical consolidated statements of operations  as a percentage of our net sales  for the three years ended september fiscal year ended september  net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  general and administrative research and development  net resizing asset impairment goodwill impairment amortization of goodwill and intangibles purchased in process research and development loss from operations fiscal years ended september  and september  bookings and backlog 
during the fiscal year ended september  we recorded bookings of million compared to million in fiscal a booking is recorded when a customer order is reviewed and determination is made that all specifications can be met  production or service and a delivery date can be scheduled  and the customer meets the company s credit requirements 
at september   the backlog of customer orders totaled million  compared to million at september  since the timing of deliveries may vary and orders are generally subject to cancellation  our backlog as of any date may not be indicative of net sales for any succeeding period 
sales 
net sales for the year ended september  were million  an increase of from million in fiscal the higher sales were primarily due to a increase in equipment sales and a increase in packaging material sales partially offset by a decrease in flip chip sales and a decrease in test segment sales 
equipment sales were higher than in the prior year due primarily to a increase in unit sales of automatic ball bonders  partially offset by lower sales of other bonding machines and accessories 
the higher packaging materials sales were due primarily to higher unit sales of bonding tools and an increase in the price of gold and the volume of gold wire shipped 
the lower sales in our test segment and flip chip services were primarily due to a lower volume of shipments 
the majority of our sales are to customers that are located outside of the united states or have manufacturing facilities outside of the united states 
shipments of our products with ultimate foreign destinations comprised of our total sales in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the majority of these foreign sales were to customer locations in the asia pacific region  including taiwan  malaysia  singapore  korea and japan 
taiwan accounted for the largest single destination for our product shipments with of our shipments in fiscal compared to of our shipments in the prior fiscal year 

table of contents gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal included in the results for fiscal and fiscal are charges for inventory write downs of million and million  respectively 
the inventory write down charge in fiscal was due primarily to excess and obsolete inventory and discontinued products 
the charge for inventory write downs in fiscal includes three distinct components million related to the write down of spare parts inventories  million associated with the discontinuance of our model dual spindle saw  and million related to excess and obsolete inventory 
we provide reserves for equipment inventory and for spare parts and consumables inventory considered to be in excess of months of forecasted future demand 
the forecasted demand is based upon internal projections  historical sales volumes  customer order activity and review of consumable inventory levels at our customers facilities 
we communicate forecasts of our future demand to suppliers and adjust commitments to those suppliers accordingly 
we review and dispose of our excess and obsolete inventory on a regular basis 
in fiscal we disposed of million of excess and obsolete inventory and in fiscal we disposed of million of excess and obsolete inventory 
the charges for inventory write downs in fiscal and fiscal primarily involve items that are not part of our continuing product offerings and accordingly  should not have a significant impact on our future business or profitability 
excluding the effect of inventory write offs  the higher gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to higher unit sales of automatic ball bonders  lower manufacturing cost per unit of our automatic ball bonders  higher unit sales of bonding tools and a higher volume of gold wire shipped 
these improvements were partially offset by lower sales and associated gross profit in our test and flip chip business units 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales was in fiscal  as compared to for the same period in the prior year 
as indicated above  gross margin in fiscal and  was unfavorably impacted by inventory write offs  which amounted to and of sales  respectively in fiscal and fiscal excluding the effect of inventory write offs  gross margin increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to lower unit cost of production for our automatic ball bonders 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative referred to as sg a expenses decreased million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the lower sg a expenses in fiscal resulted primarily from our cost saving initiatives  principally related to reductions in employment levels 
included in the sg a expense for fiscal were costs associated with workforce reductions severance of million  start up costs for our new china facility of approximately million and a million charge for the early termination of an information technology services agreement partially offset by the favorable reversal of a million reserve  previously established for potential obligations to us customs 
included in the fiscal sg a expense were workforce reductions severance of million and training and start up costs for our new china facility of million 
research and development 
research and development r d expense in fiscal decreased million or from fiscal the lower r d expense in fiscal was primarily due to the closure of our substrate business unit in the fourth quarter of fiscal and lower payroll and related expenses due to our ongoing cost reduction efforts 
resizing costs 
the semiconductor industry is volatile  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
the industry experienced excess capacity and a severe contraction in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment from through most of in fiscal and  we developed resizing plans in response to these changes in the business environment with the intent to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels 
expenses associated with these cost containment activities were incurred and included downsizing and facility consolidations 
accounting for resizing activities requires an evaluation of formally agreed upon and approved plans 
although we made every attempt to consolidate all known resizing activities into one plan  the extreme cycles and rapidly changing forecasting environment place limitations on achieving this objective 
the recognition of a resizing event does not necessarily preclude similar but unrelated actions in future periods 
in the fiscal we reversed thousand of these resizing charges due to the actual severance cost associated with the terminated positions being less than those originally estimated 
we recorded resizing charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal 
table of contents a summary of all the resizing plans initiated in fiscal and and acquisition restructuring plans initiated in fiscal appears below in thousands fiscal and resizing plans and severance and acquisition restructurings benefits commitments total provision for resizing plans in fiscal acquisition restructurings payment of obligations in fiscal balance  september  provision for resizing plans in fiscal payment of obligations in fiscal balance  september  change in estimate payment of obligations in fiscal balance  september  the individual resizing plans and acquisition restructuring plans initiated in fiscal and are identified below charges in fiscal year fourth quarter in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced that we would close our substrate operations due to its high capital and operating cash requirements 
as a result  we recorded a resizing charge of million 
the resizing charge included a severance charge of million for the elimination of positions and lease obligations of million 
at september  all the positions had been eliminated 
the plans have been completed but cash payments for the severance charge are expected to continue through and cash payments for the lease obligations are expected to continue into  or such time as the obligations can be satisfied 
in addition to these resizing charges  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote off million of fixed assets and million of intangible assets associated with the closure of the substrate operation 
the resizing costs were included in accrued liabilities 
the table below details the activity related to this resizing program during fiscal and in thousands severance and fourth quarter charge benefits commitments total provision for resizing balance  september  change in estimate payment of obligations balance  september  third quarter in the third quarter of fiscal  we announced a resizing plan to reduce headcount and consolidate manufacturing in our test division 
the resizing plan was a result of our decision to move towards a hour per day manufacturing model in our major us wafer test facility  which would provide our customers with faster turn around time and delivery of orders and economies of scale in manufacturing 
as part of this plan  we moved manufacturing of wafer test products from our facilities in gilbert  arizona and austin  texas to our facility in san jose  california and dallas  texas and from 
table of contents our kaohsuing  taiwan facility to our hsin chu  taiwan facility 
the resizing plan includes a severance charge of million for the elimination of positions as a result of the manufacturing consolidation 
at september   all of the positions had been eliminated 
the resizing plan also includes a charge of million associated with the closure of the kaohsuing  taiwan facility and an austin  texas facility  representing costs of non cancelable lease obligations beyond the facility closure and costs required to restore the production facilities to their original state 
both facilities have been closed 
the plans have been completed but cash payments for the severance are expected to continue through and cash payments for facility and contractual obligations are expected to continue through  or such time as the obligations can be satisfied 
the resizing costs were included in accrued liabilities 
the table below details the activity related to this resizing program during fiscal and in thousands severance and third quarter charge benefits commitments total provision for resizing payment of obligations balance  september  payment of obligations balance  september  second quarter in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced a resizing plan comprised of a functional realignment of business management and the consolidation and closure of certain facilities 
in connection with the resizing plan  we recorded a charge of million  consisting of severance and benefits of million for positions that were to be eliminated as a result of the functional realignment  facility consolidation  the shift of certain manufacturing to china including our hub blade business and the move of our microelectronics products to singapore and a charge of million for the cost of lease commitments beyond the closure date of facilities to be exited as part of the facility consolidation plan 
to reduce our short term cash requirements  we decided  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  not to relocate either our hub blade manufacturing facility from the united states to china or its microelectronics product manufacturing from the united states to singapore  as previously announced 
this change in our facility relocation plan resulted in a reversal of million of the resizing costs recorded in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of the functional realignment  we terminated employees at all levels of the organization from factory workers to vice presidents 
the organizational change shifted management of our businesses to functional ie sales  manufacturing  research and development  etc 
areas across product lines rather than by product line 
for example  research and development activities for the entire company are now controlled and coordinated by one corporate vice president under the functional organizational structure  rather than separately by each business unit 
this structure provides for a more efficient allocation of human and capital resources to achieve corporate r d initiatives 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we closed five test facilities two in the united states  one in france  one in malaysia  and one in singapore 
these operations were absorbed into other company facilities 
the resizing charge for the facility consolidation reflects the cost of lease commitments beyond the exit date that is associated with these closed test facilities 
the plans have been completed but cash payments for the severance charges and the facility and contractual obligations are expected to continue through  or such time as the obligations can be satisfied 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed thousand of resizing expenses and in the fourth quarter of fiscal we reversed thousand of resizing expenses  previously recorded in the second quarter of fiscal  due to actual severance costs associated with the terminated positions being less than those estimated as a result of employees leaving the company before they were severed

goodwill impairment 
effective october   we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the provisions of this standard  the intangible assets that are classified as goodwill and those with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized 
intangible assets with determinable lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful life 
the standard also requires that an impairment test be performed to support the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at least annually 
we reviewed our business and determined that there are five reporting units to be reviewed for impairment in accordance with the standard the reporting units are the bonding wire  hub blade  substrate  flip chip and test businesses 
the bonding wire and hub blade businesses are included in our packaging materials segment  the substrate and flip chip businesses are included in our advanced packaging segment and the test business comprises our test segment 
there is no goodwill associated with our equipment segment 
upon adoption of sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the required transitional impairment testing of intangible assets  and based upon those analyses  did not identify any impairment charges as a result of adoption of this standard effective october  we have determined that our annual test for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets will take place at the end of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  which coincides with the completion of our annual forecasting process 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we determined that the value of goodwill at our flip chip business unit could not be supported by our current earnings forecasts 
as a result  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million 
likewise  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our earnings forecasts did not support the value of goodwill at several of our operating units 
as a result  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million in our test reporting unit and a goodwill impairment charge of million in our hub blade reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows

purchased in process research and development in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for in process r d associated with the acquisitions of cerprobe and probe tech  representing the appraised value of products still in the development stage that did not have a future alternative use and which had not reached technological feasibility 
as part of the acquisition  we acquired ongoing r d projects  all aimed at increasing the technological features of the existing probe cards and therefore the number of test applications for which they could be marketed 
the r d projects ranged from researching the feasibility of producing multi die testing probes to researching the feasibility of producing probes for specialized semiconductor package csp and bga configurations 
the project stage of completion ranged from to and all projects were due for completion and product launch by the third quarter of at prices and costs similar to the existing probe cards marketed by cerprobe and probe tech 
in the valuation of this in process technology  we utilize a variation of the income approach 
we forecast revenue  earnings and cash flow for the products under development 
revenues are projected to extend out over the expected useful lives for each project 
the technology is then valued through the application of the discounted cash flow method 
values were calculated using the present value of their projected future cash flow at discount rates of between and 
we anticipated that some of these projects might take longer to develop than originally thought and that some of these projects may never be marketable and took into account the risk that the anticipated future cash flows might not be achieved 
of the ongoing r d projects at the time of the acquisition five have been completed  one is still in progress  four have been cancelled due to overlapping technology with our cobra line of vertical test products  and six were cancelled due to nonproductive results

we then shifted our r d efforts to further enhancement of the probe tech vertical probe technology and cancelled the r d projects at cerprobe that were enhancing the cerprobe vertical probe technology 
the r d projects identified by in the above table were cerprobe projects that were cancelled due to the shift in focus to the probe tech vertical probe technology 
we expect the future revenue from the probe tech vertical probe technology will replace the anticipated revenue from the cerprobe vertical probe r d projected that have been cancelled 
the value assigned at purchase reflects the present value of the projected future cash flow generated from the sale of products created by each r d project from its launch date through the expected life of the product 
loss from operations 
our loss from operations in fiscal was million compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the smaller operating loss in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to higher sales and gross profit  lower sg a and r d expenses  no resizing expenses  and lower asset and goodwill impairment charges 
interest 
interest income in fiscal was thousand compared to million in the prior year 
the lower interest 
table of contents income was due primarily to lower cash balances to invest coupled with lower interest rates on short term investments 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the lower interest expense in fiscal resulted from the elimination in fiscal of interest associated with a receivable securitization program which was cancelled in july of loss on sale of product lines 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold the fixed assets  inventories and intellectual property associated with our sawing and hard material blade product lines for million in cash 
we wrote off million of net assets associated with the transaction 
in addition  we sold the assets associated with our polymers business for thousand 
other income and minority interest 
other income of million in fiscal was associated with the cash settlement of an insurance claim associated with a fire in our bonding tools facility 
other income also includes minority interest of thousand in fiscal for the portion of the loss of a foreign test division subsidiary that was owned by a third party 
we purchased the third party s interest in fiscal tax expense 
we recognized tax expense of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the tax expense in fiscal represents income tax on foreign earnings and reserves for foreign withholding tax on repatriation of certain foreign earnings 
in fiscal we established a valuation allowance of million against our u 
s and foreign net operating losses 
the tax expense in fiscal was due primarily to a million charge to establish a valuation allowance against our us net operating loss carryforwards  a million charge to provide for tax expense on repatriation of certain foreign earnings and foreign income taxes of million 
these charges were partially offset by a benefit of million from the pretax loss in the us cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in fiscal  we adopted sab and recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  net of taxes of million 
the cumulative effect represents the net income associated with million of sales that were deferred upon adoption of the standard 
we recognized million of the million of deferred sales in fiscal and million in fiscal at september   deferred sales revenue was approximately thousand 
net loss 
our net loss for fiscal was million compared to a net loss of million in fiscal  for the reasons enumerated above 
fiscal years ended september  and september  bookings and backlog 
during the fiscal year ended september  we recorded bookings of million compared to million in fiscal at september   the backlog of customer orders totaled million  compared to million at september  since the timing of deliveries may vary and orders are generally subject to cancellation  our backlog as of any date may not be indicative of net sales for any succeeding period 
sales 
net sales for the year ended september  were million  down from million in fiscal the decrease in sales reflected the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry  which significantly impacted sales of our semiconductor assembly equipment and test products 
fiscal sales in the equipment segment were down  due to lower average selling prices for our automatic ball bonders and lower sales of dicing systems and tab bonders  partially offset by higher unit sales of automatic ball bonders 
net sales in the packaging materials segment were up  due to higher demand for gold wire and capillaries primarily in the fourth quarter 
net sales in the advanced packaging segment were down from the prior year due to lower bumping revenue and license fees at flip chip 
sales for the test division were down for the fiscal year  however  test sales for fiscal included only the months from the dates of acquisition through september  international sales shipments of our products with ultimate foreign destinations comprised and of our total sales during fiscal and  respectively 
the majority of these foreign sales were destined for customer locations in the asia pacific region  including taiwan  malaysia  singapore  korea  japan  and the philippines 
our shipments to customers in china have historically been a small portion of our sales  however we expect this portion to increase as some of our customers increase their production capacity in china 
we expect sales outside of the united states to continue to 
table of contents represent a substantial portion of our future revenues 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline was due primarily to lower average selling prices for automatic ball bonders and lower unit sales of dicing systems and tab bonders in the equipment segment and lower sales volume at flip chip in the advanced packaging segment 
partially offsetting the above mentioned declines in gross profit was higher unit sales of automatic ball bonders and packaging materials and higher gross profit in the test segment 
included in the results for fiscal are charges for inventory write downs of million 
these charges for inventory write downs include three distinct components 
the largest component of the charge  amounting to approximately million  relates to the write down of spare parts inventories 
we decided in the second quarter of fiscal to outsource our spare parts inventory management and accordingly wrote down excess inventory 
the second component of the charge relates to the write down of million of inventory associated with the discontinuance of our model dual spindle saw 
annual revenue for this product over the past several fiscal years has been insignificant therefore  the discontinuance of this product is not expected to have a material impact on sales  gross profit or net income 
the smallest portion of the charge  amounting to million  related to our normal excess and obsolescence reviews that are a recurring part of our normal business and ongoing operations 
we provide reserves for equipment inventory and for spare parts and consumables inventory considered to be in excess of months of forecasted future demand 
the forecasted demand is based upon internal projections  historical sales volumes  customer order activity and review of consumable inventory levels at our customers facilities 
we communicate forecasts of our future demand to suppliers and adjust commitments to those suppliers accordingly 
we review and dispose of our excess and obsolete inventory on a regular basis 
in fiscal  we disposed of million of excess and obsolete inventory 
the charges for inventory write downs in fiscal primarily involve items that are not part of our continuing product offerings and accordingly  should not have a significant impact on our future business or profitability 
included in the results for fiscal are charges for inventory write downs of million to costs of goods sold 
we recorded million of the charge in the first quarter for excess and obsolete ball bonder inventory and million in the second quarter for ball bonder and spare parts inventory 
in the fourth quarter we recorded a charge of million for excess and obsolete ball bonder  dicing saw  test fixture and spare parts inventory 
the charges for inventory write downs resulted from the severe and continued downturn in the semiconductor industry 
in fiscal  we also recorded an acquisition related inventory step up charge of million 
in fiscal  we disposed of million of excess and obsolete inventory 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales was in fiscal  as compared to for the same period in the prior year 
the decline in gross margin for the year was due primarily to lower average selling prices of automatic ball bonders and dicing systems and a negative gross profit at flip chip 
the inventory write downs in fiscal and fiscal amounted to and of net sales  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative referred to as sg a expenses decreased million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal fiscal sg a expenses include approximately million of expenses which are not comparable to the fiscal expenses 
the million of non comparable expense include million of severance expense  million for two additional months of expenses at the test division months of operations in vs 
only ten months and million of training and start up expense associated with our new china facility 
excluding these charges  our fiscal sg a expense declined due to reduced compensation and outside services expenses from our resizing initiatives taken in the current and prior year 
research and development 
research and development r d expense in fiscal decreased million or from fiscal the lower r d spending was due to a shift in certain engineering functions to lower cost foreign subsidiaries  and the push out of certain future product development initiatives 
our r d expense includes the cost to develop the software that operates our semiconductor assembly equipment  which is expensed as incurred 
resizing costs 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
the industry has experienced excess capacity and a severe contraction in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment for the past two years 
we developed resizing plans in response to these changes in our business environment with the intent to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels 
expenses have been incurred associated with cost containment activities including downsizing and facility consolidations 
accounting for resizing activities requires an 
table of contents evaluation of formally agreed upon and approved plans 
although we make every attempt to consolidate all known resizing activities into one plan  the extreme cycles and rapidly changing forecasting environment places limitations on achieving this objective 
the recognition of a resizing event does not necessarily exclude similar but unrelated actions in future periods 
we recorded resizing charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal charges in fiscal year fourth quarter in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced that we would close our substrate operations due to its high capital and operating cash requirements 
as a result  we recorded a resizing charge of million 
the resizing charge includes a severance charge of million for the elimination of positions and lease obligations of million 
while none of the positions were terminated as of september   all but one were terminated in the first quarter of fiscal and the remaining position was expected to be terminated by march  cash payments for the severance charge are expected to be complete by march  but cash payments for the facility and contractual obligations are expected to continue until the end of  or such time as the obligations can be satisfied 
in addition to these resizing charges  we wrote off million of fixed assets and million of intangible assets associated with the closure of the substrate operation 
the resizing costs were included in accrued liabilities 
the table below details the spending and activity related to the resizing plan initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal in thousands severance and fourth quarter charge benefits commitments total provision for resizing payment of obligations balance  september  third quarter in the third quarter of fiscal  we announced a resizing plan to reduce headcount and consolidate manufacturing in our test division 
the resizing plan was a result of our decision to move towards a hour per day manufacturing model in our major us wafer test facility  which will provide our customers with faster turn around time and delivery of orders and economies of scale in manufacturing 
as part of this plan  we moved manufacturing of wafer test products from our gilbert  arizona facility and our austin  texas facility to our san jose  california and dallas  texas facilities and from our kaohsuing  taiwan facility to our hsin chu  taiwan facility 
the resizing plan includes a severance charge of million for the elimination of positions as a result of the manufacturing consolidation 
at september   of the positions have been eliminated 
the remaining positions were expected to be terminated by june  the resizing plan also included a charge of million associated with the closure of the kaohsuing  taiwan and austin  texas facilities representing costs of non cancelable lease obligations beyond the facility closure date and costs required to restore the production facilities to their original state 
both facilities have been closed 
cash payments for the severance charge are expected to be complete by march  but cash payments for the facility obligations are expected to continue through  or such time as the obligations can be satisfied 

table of contents the resizing costs were included in accrued liabilities 
the table below details the spending and activity related to the resizing plan initiated in the third quarter of fiscal in thousands severance and third quarter charge benefits commitments total provision for resizing payment of obligations balance  september  second quarter in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced a resizing plan comprised of a functional realignment of business management and the consolidation and closure of certain facilities 
in connection with the resizing plan  we recorded a charge of million  consisting of severance and benefits of million for positions that were to be eliminated as a result of the functional realignment  facility consolidation  the shift of certain manufacturing to china including our hub blade business and the move of the company s microelectronics products to singapore and a charge of million for the cost of lease commitments beyond the closure date of facilities to be exited as part of the facility consolidation plan 
to reduce our short term cash requirements  we decided  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  not to move our hub blade manufacturing facility from the united states to china and our microelectronics product manufacturing from the united states to singapore  as previously announced 
while we believe our cost structure would be reduced by transitioning production from the united states to less expensive sites in asia  we have decided that the immediate costs associated with transition and training should be deferred 
this change in our facility relocation plan resulted in a reversal of million of the resizing costs recorded in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of the functional realignment  we terminated employees at all levels of the organization from factory workers to vice presidents 
the organizational change shifts management of our businesses to functional ie sales  manufacturing  research and development  etc 
areas across product lines rather than by product line 
for example  research and development activities for the entire company are now controlled and coordinated by one corporate vice president under the functional organizational structure  rather than separately by each business unit 
this structure provides for a more efficient allocation of human and capital resources to achieve corporate r d initiatives 
in the second quarter  we closed five test facilities two in the united states  one in france  one in malaysia  and one in singapore  whose operations were absorbed into other company facilities 
the resizing charge for the facility consolidation reflects the cost of lease commitments beyond the exit date that is associated with these closed test facilities 
at september   four positions remain to be terminated and are expected to be terminated by december  cash payments for the severance charge were expected to be complete by march  but cash payments for the facility and contractual obligations were expected to continue through  or such time as the obligations can be satisfied 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed thousand of resizing expenses  previously recorded in the second quarter  due to actual severance costs associated with the terminated positions being less than those originally estimated

in addition to the workforce resizings and the facility consolidations  we terminated several of our major initiatives in an effort to more closely align our cost structure with expected revenue levels 
as a result  we recorded asset impairment charges of million in fiscal we also recorded an asset impairment of thousand in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment of million 
the charge included million associated with the cancellation of a company wide integrated information system  an million write off of assets associated with the closure of the substrates operation and million of assets associated with a closed wire facility in taiwan 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million 
the write off included a million charge for the write off of development and license costs of certain engineering and manufacturing software  which had not yet been completed or placed in service and would never be utilized 
also in the second quarter  we wrote off million related to leasehold improvements at the leased probe card manufacturing facilities in malaysia and the united states  which have been closed 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to the closure of a wire facility in the united states and the disposition of the associated equipment 
goodwill impairment 
effective october   we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the intangible assets that are classified as goodwill and those with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized under the provisions of this standard 
intangible assets with determinable lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful life 
the standard also requires that an impairment test be performed to support the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at least annually 
we reviewed our business and determined that there are five reporting units to be reviewed for impairment in accordance with the standard the reporting units were the bonding wire  hub blade  substrate  flip chip and test business

due to the severity and the length of the current industry downturn and uncertainty of the timing of improvement in industry conditions we have revised our earnings forecasts for each of our business units that were tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  we discontinued our substrate business and wrote off intangible assets of million and recognized a goodwill impairment loss of million in our test reporting unit and a goodwill impairment loss of million in our

the agreement governing our purchase of probe tech from siegel robert corp 
included a provision for reducing the purchase price if probe tech s actual earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda were less than a projected amount 
we disputed probe tech s ebitda calculation and initiated arbitration seeking a reduction in the purchase price 
the arbitrator s award reduced the purchase price by million in the second quarter of fiscal in june  we received the final settlement and reduced goodwill by million  reflecting the award  less costs incurred in the arbitration

this amount consists of equipment that was shipped and recorded as revenue in fiscal but had not met the customer acceptance criteria required by sab in fiscal  we recorded an after tax non cash charge of million or per fully diluted share  associated with the million of deferred revenue  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
in fiscal  we received customer acceptances for million of the million that was deferred as of the beginning of the fiscal year and accordingly recognized million of revenue 
also in fiscal  we recorded after tax non cash profit of million or per fully diluted share associated with the million of deferred revenue 
at september   deferred revenue was approximately million  which will be recognized in future periods as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
in fiscal  we recognized net sales of million  of the million of sales deferred upon adoption  and million of associated after tax profit 
no additional revenue was deferred during fiscal at september   deferred revenue was approximately thousand 
shipping and handling revenues and costs 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on issue eitf no 
 accounting for shipping and handling revenues and costs 
the task force concluded that amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling should be classified as revenue 
we adopted the consensus in fiscal  and the impact was not material to our financial position and results of operations 
effective october   we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the intangible assets that are classified as goodwill and those with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized under the provisions of this standard 
intangible assets with determinable lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful life 
we amortize our intangible assets with determinable lives on a straight line basis over the estimated period to be benefited by the intangible assets which we estimates to be years 
the standard also requires that an impairment test be performed to support the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at least annually 
our goodwill impairment test utilizes discounted cash flows to determine fair value and comparative market multiples to corroborate fair value 
our intangible assets other than goodwill are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows  and if impaired  written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values 
our intangible assets are comprised of customer accounts and complete technology in our test interconnect business segment 
we manage and value our complete technology in the aggregate as one asset group 
asset retirement obligations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
this standard provides guidance for financial reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it also provides guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessors 
we adopted this standard effective october  and the adoption did not have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations  however this standard could impact our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
this standard provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and establishes additional criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group 
estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset or asset group must incorporate the entity s own assumptions about its use of the asset or asset group and must factor in all available evidence 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such events include significant under performance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes in market capitalization 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of our sawing and hard material blade product lines as well as our polymer product line 
as a result of these transactions  we recorded a loss of million made up of asset write offs of million offset by cash proceeds of million 
as of september   we recognized a million impairment charge associated with our flip chip division 
the 
table of contents present value of flip chip s future cash flows was less than the remaining carrying value 
as a result  an asset impairment charge was recorded to reduce the carrying value of flip chip to its fair value 
sfas in april  the fasb issued sfas  recission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
in rescinding fasb statement no 
and fasb no 
 fasb eliminates the requirement that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of the related income tax effect  however  an entity would not be prohibited from classifying such gains and losses as extraordinary items so long as they meet the criteria of paragraph of apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
further  the statement amends sfas to eliminate an inconsistency between the accounting for sale leaseback transactions and certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
we adopted this standard and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for exit or disposal activities which addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the emerging issues task force eitf has set forth in eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the standard is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we have adopted this standard and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations  however  this standard will in certain circumstances change the timing of recognition of restructuring costs 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the standard is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure provisions of this standard 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires a company the guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the interpretation also incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others which is being superseded 
the recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we adopted this standard and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations  however this standard could impact our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   total cash and investments were million  compared to million at june  and million at september  cash used by operating activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cash used by operating activities in fiscal was primarily to fund the net loss and working capital needs 
the working capital needs in fiscal were primarily for the pay down of current trade payables  the pay out of costs associated with our fiscal and resizing programs and an increase in trade accounts receivable 
cash used by operating activities in fiscal was primarily to fund the net loss in that year 
cash provided by investing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
in fiscal and  the investing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from sales of investments  offset by purchases of investments and capital expenditures 
in fiscal we spent million in capital expenditures  consisting primarily of million for continued expansion of our china facility  million for manufacturing 
table of contents equipment in our test business unit and million of manufacturing equipment in our other manufacturing facilities 
in fiscal we spent million in capital expenditures  million of which was for costs associated with our initiative to implement a company wide integrated information system 
these costs were accounted for in accordance with sop we discontinued this project in the fourth quarter of fiscal and wrote off the million as part of a total write off of million associated with this project 
in fiscal  we also spent approximately million on facility upgrades and manufacturing equipment in our test business 
in addition  in fiscal  we announced plans to build a facility in china to manufacture capillaries  selected test products and other products 
we spent million on this china facility in fiscal cash provided by financing activities was thousand in fiscal compared to cash used in financing activities of million in the prior fiscal year 
the cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in restricted cash and proceeds from the issuance of common stock  resulting from employee stock option exercises 
cash used by financing activities in the prior year was primarily due to establishing restricted cash balances  to support letters of credit  and payments on capital leases partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock  resulting from employee stock option exercises 
at september   the fair value of our million convertible subordinated notes was million  and the fair value of our million convertible subordinated notes was million 
the fair values were determined using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date 
the fair value of our other assets and liabilities approximates the book value of those assets and liabilities 
on september   the standard poor s rating on the above referenced convertible subordinated notes was ccc 
the securities and exchange commission declared effective on august  a shelf registration statement on form s  which will permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  senior debt securities  senior subordinated debt securities  subordinated debt securities  warrants and units  having an aggregate sales price of up to million 
on june   we issued and contributed  shares of common stock with a fair market value of  to fund certain obligations to our pension plan 
we will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of these shares by the pension plan 
the proceeds will be retained by the pension plan trust to fund future obligations to participants of the pension plan 
we believe that our existing cash reserves and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  our liquidity is affected by many factors  some based on normal operations of the business and others related to uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
we may seek  as we believe appropriate  additional debt or equity financing to provide capital for corporate purposes 
we may also seek additional debt or equity financing for the refinancing or redemption of existing debt and or to fund strategic business opportunities  including possible acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances or other business arrangements which could require substantial capital outlays 
the timing and amount of such potential capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our products  semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industry conditions  competitive factors  the condition of financial markets and the nature and size of strategic business opportunities which we may elect to pursue 
under gaap  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on liquidity 
certain of the following commitments as of september  have not been included in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
however  they have been disclosed in the following table in order to provide a more complete picture of our company s financial position and liquidity 

table of contents the following table identifies obligations and contingent payments under various arrangements at september   including those not included on our consolidated balance sheet in thousands amounts amounts due in amounts amounts due in less than due in due in more than total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations inventory purchase obligations commercial commitments standby letters of credit total contractual obligations and commercial commitments represents contractual amounts not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at september  long term debt includes the amounts due under our convertible subordinated notes due december and our convertible subordinated notes due august the capital lease obligations principally relate to a building and equipment lease 
the operating lease obligations at september  represent obligations due under various facility and equipment leases with terms up to fifteen years in duration 
inventory purchase obligations represent outstanding purchase commitments for inventory components ordered in the normal course of business 
the standby letters of credit represent obligations of the company in lieu of security deposits for a facility lease and employee benefit programs 
risk factors risks relating to our business the semiconductor industry is volatile with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns our operating results are significantly affected by the capital expenditures of large semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems 
expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products that use semiconductors  including personal computers  telecommunications equipment  consumer electronics  and automotive goods 
significant downturns in the market for semiconductor devices or in general economic conditions reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with periods of rapid growth followed by industry wide retrenchment 
these periodic downturns and slowdowns have adversely affected our operating results 
they have been characterized by  among other things  diminished product demand  excess production capacity  and accelerated erosion of selling prices 
this has severely and negatively affected the industry s demand for capital equipment  including the assembly equipment that we manufacture and market and  to a lesser extent  the packaging materials and test interconnect solutions that we sell 
the semiconductor industry has recently experienced downturns in fiscal through the first half of fiscal  and in fiscal through the first half of fiscal in the downturn  our net sales declined from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal in the most recent downturn  our net sales declined from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal although the business environment 
table of contents improved in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we cannot assure you that the market for semiconductors will continue to improve or that the market will not experience additional and possibly more severe and prolonged downturns in the future 
such downturns would adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may experience increasing price pressure our historical business strategy for many of our products has been focused on product performance and customer service rather than on price 
the length and severity of the recent economic downturn put increased cost pressure on our customers and we have observed increasing price sensitivity on their part 
in response to these pressures  we are actively seeking to reduce our cost structure by moving operations to lower cost areas and by reducing other operating costs 
if we are unable to realize prices that allow us to continue to compete on the basis of performance and service  our financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly and may continue to do so in the future in the past  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly  we expect that they will continue to fluctuate 
although these fluctuations are partly due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor industry  they also reflect other factors  many of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that may cause our revenues and or operating margins to fluctuate significantly from period to period are market downturns  the mix of products that we sell because  for example our test interconnect business has lower margins than assembly equipment and packaging materials  some lines of equipment are more profitable than others  and some sales arrangements have higher margins than others  the volume and timing of orders for our products and any order postponements  virtually all of our orders are subject to cancellation  deferral or rescheduling by the customer without prior notice and with limited or no penalties  adverse changes in our pricing  or that of our competitors  higher than anticipated costs of development or production of new equipment models  the availability and cost of key components for our products  market acceptance of our new products and upgraded versions of our products  customers delay in purchasing our products due to customer anticipation that we may introduce new or upgraded products  and our competitors introduction of new products 
many of our expenses  such as research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses and interest expense  do not vary directly with our net sales 
as a result  a decline in our net sales would adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  if we were to incur additional expenses in a quarter in which we did not experience comparable increased net sales  our operating results would decline 
in a downturn  we may have excess inventory  which is required 
table of contents to be written off 
some of the factors that may cause our expenses to fluctuate from period to period include the timing and extent of our research and development efforts  severance  resizing and the costs of relocating or closing down facilities  inventory write offs due to obsolescence  and inflationary increases in the cost of labor or materials 
because our revenues and operating results are volatile and difficult to predict  we believe that consecutive period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
most of our sales and a substantial portion of our manufacturing are located outside of the united states  and we rely on independent foreign distribution channels for certain product lines  all of which subject us to risks from changes in trade regulations  currency fluctuations  political instability and war approximately of our net sales for fiscal  of our net sales for fiscal and of our net sales for fiscal were attributable to sales to customers for delivery outside of the united states  in particular to customers in the asia pacific region 
we expect these trends to continue 
thus  our future performance will depend  in significant part  on our ability to continue to compete in foreign markets  particularly in asia pacific 
these economies have been highly volatile  resulting in significant fluctuation in local currencies  and political and economic instability 
these conditions may continue or worsen  which may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we also rely on non united states suppliers for materials and components used in our products  and most of our manufacturing operations are located in countries other than the united states 
we manufacture our automatic ball bonders and bonding wire in singapore  we manufacture capillaries in israel and china and we have sales  service and support personnel in china  hong kong  japan  korea  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  taiwan and europe 
we also rely on independent foreign distribution channels for certain of our product lines 
as a result  a major portion of our business is subject to the risks associated with international  and particularly asian pacific  commerce  such as risks of war and civil disturbances or other events that may limit or disrupt markets  expropriation of our foreign assets  longer payment cycles in foreign markets  international exchange restrictions  restrictions on the repatriation of our assets  including cash  the difficulties of staffing and managing dispersed international operations  episodic events outside our control such as  for example  the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  tariff and currency fluctuations  changing political conditions  labor conditions and costs  foreign governments monetary policies  
table of contents less protective foreign intellectual property laws  and legal systems which may be less predictable than those in the united states 
because most of our foreign sales are denominated in united states dollars  an increase in value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies  particularly the japanese yen  will make our products more expensive than those offered by some of our foreign competitors 
our ability to compete overseas in the future may be materially and adversely affected by a strengthening of the united states dollar against foreign currencies 
because we have significant assets  including cash  outside the united states  those assets are subject to risks of destruction and seizure  and it may be difficult to repatriate them  including cash  or repatriation may result in the payment by us of significant united states taxes 
our international operations also depend  in part  upon a continuation of current trade relations between the united states and those foreign countries in which our customers  subcontractors  and materials suppliers have operations 
a protectionist trade environment in either the united states or those foreign countries in which we do business  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export compliance or other trade policies  may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets 
our business depends on attracting and retaining management  marketing and technical employees as with many other technology companies  our future success depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified management  marketing and technical employees 
in particular  we periodically experience shortages of engineers 
if we are unable to continue to attract and retain the managerial  marketing and technical personnel we require  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we may not be able to rapidly develop and manufacture new and enhanced products required to maintain or expand our business we believe that our continued success depends on our ability to continuously develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
we also must timely introduce these products and product enhancements into the market in response to customers demands for higher performance assembly equipment  leading edge materials and for test interconnect solutions customized to address rapid technological advances in integrated circuits and capital equipment designs 
our competitors may develop new products or enhancements to their products that offer performance  features and lower prices that may render our products less competitive 
the development and commercialization of new products will require significant capital expenditures over an extended period of time  and some products that we seek to develop may never become profitable 
in addition  we may not be able to develop and introduce products incorporating new technologies in a timely manner or at a price that will satisfy our customers future needs or achieve market acceptance 
difficulties in forecasting demand for our product lines may lead to periodic inventory shortages or excesses we typically operate our business with a relatively short backlog 
as a result  we sometimes experience inventory shortages or excesses 
we generally order supplies and otherwise plan our production based on internal forecasts of demand 
we have in the past  and may again in the future  fail to forecast accurately demand  in terms of both volume and configuration for either our current or next generation wire bonders 
this has led to and may in the future lead to delays in product shipments or  alternatively  an increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
if we fail to forecast accurately demand for our products  including assembly equipment  packaging materials and test interconnect solutions  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
advanced packaging technologies other than wire bonding may render some of our products obsolete advanced packaging technologies have emerged that may improve device performance or reduce the size of an integrated circuit package  as compared to traditional die and wire bonding 
these technologies include flip chip and chip scale packaging 
some of these advanced technologies eliminate the need for wires to establish the electrical connection 
table of contents between a die and its package 
we cannot assure you that the semiconductor industry will not  in the future  shift a significant part of its volume into advanced packaging technologies  such as those discussed above 
if a significant shift to advanced packaging technologies were to occur  demand for our wire bonders and related packaging materials may be materially and adversely affected 
a decline in demand for any of our products could cause our revenues to decline significantly if demand for  or pricing of  our wire bonders or test interconnect solutions declines because our competitors introduce superior or lower cost systems  the semiconductor industry changes or demand for our products declines because of other events beyond our control  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
because a small number of customers account for most of our sales  our revenues could decline if we lose any significant customer the semiconductor manufacturing industry is highly concentrated  with a relatively small number of large semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems purchasing a substantial portion of our semiconductor assembly equipment  packaging materials and test interconnect solutions 
sales to a relatively small number of customers account for a significant percentage of our net sales 
in fiscal and  sales to advanced semiconductor engineering accounted for and  respectively  of our net sales 
in fiscal  no customer accounted for more than of our net sales 
we expect that sales of our products to a small number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
thus  our business success depends on our ability to maintain strong relationships with our important customers 
any one of a number of factors could adversely affect these relationships 
if  for example  during periods of escalating demand for our equipment  we are unable to add inventory and production capacity quickly enough to meet the needs of our customers  they may turn to other suppliers making it more difficult for us to retain their business 
similarly  if we are unable for any other reason to meet production or delivery schedules  particularly during a period of escalating demand  our relationships with our key customers could be adversely affected 
if we lose orders from a significant customer  or if a significant customer reduces its orders substantially  these losses or reductions may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we depend on a small number of suppliers for raw materials  components and subassemblies 
if our suppliers do not deliver their products to us  we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers our products are complex and require raw materials  components and subassemblies having a high degree of reliability  accuracy and performance 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture many of these components and subassemblies and we rely on sole source suppliers for some important components and raw materials  including gold 
as a result  we are exposed to a number of significant risks  including lack of control over the manufacturing process for components and subassemblies  changes in our manufacturing processes  dictated by changes in the market  that may delay our shipments  our inadvertent use of defective or contaminated raw materials  the relatively small operations and limited manufacturing resources of some of our suppliers  which may limit their ability to manufacture and sell subassemblies  components or parts in the volumes we require and at acceptable quality levels and prices  the risk of reliability or quality problems with certain key subassemblies provided by single source suppliers as to which we may not have any short term alternative  shortages caused by disruptions at our suppliers and subcontractors for a variety of reasons  including work stoppage  fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters  
table of contents delays in the delivery of raw materials or subassemblies  which  in turn  may delay our shipments  and the loss of suppliers as a result of the consolidation of suppliers in the industry 
if we are unable to deliver products to our customers on time for these or any other reasons  if we are unable to meet customer expectations as to cycle time  or if we do not maintain acceptable product quality or reliability  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
our diversification presents significant management and operating challenges during fiscal  we acquired two companies that design and manufacture test interconnect solutions  cerprobe corporation and probe technology corporation  and combined their operations to create our test division 
since its acquisition in  our test interconnect business has not performed to our expectation 
problems include difficulty in rationalizing duplicated products and facilities  and in integrating these acquisitions 
our plan to correct these problems centers on the following steps standardize production processes between the various test manufacturing sites  create and ramp production of our highest volume products in a new low cost site in china and or outsource production where appropriate  then rationalize excess capacity by converting existing high cost  low volume manufacturing sites to service centers 
these plans will not mature before the second half of fiscal  and if we are unable to successfully implement this plan or another  our operating margins and results of operations will continue to be adversely affected by the performance of our test interconnect segment 
more generally  our diversification strategy has increased demands on our management  financial resources and information and internal control systems 
our success will depend in part on our ability to manage and integrate our test interconnect and equipment and packaging materials businesses and to continue successfully to implement  improve and expand our systems  procedures and controls 
if we fail successfully to integrate our existing businesses or businesses that we may subsequently acquire or to develop the necessary internal procedures to manage diversified businesses  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may from time to time in the future seek to expand our business through acquisition 
in that event  the success of any such acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate and finance on acceptable terms the acquisition 
we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor equipment  packaging materials and test interconnect solutions industries the semiconductor equipment  packaging materials and test interconnect solutions industries are very competitive 
in the semiconductor equipment and test interconnect solutions markets  significant competitive factors include performance  quality  customer support and price 
in the semiconductor packaging materials industry competitive factors include price  delivery and quality 
in each of our markets  we face competition and the threat of competition from established competitors and potential new entrants  some of which have significantly greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than we have 
some of these competitors are asian and european companies that have had and may continue to have an advantage over us in supplying products to local customers who appear to prefer to purchase from local suppliers  without regard to other considerations 
we expect our competitors to improve their current products performance  and to introduce new products and materials with improved price and performance characteristics 
our competitors may independently develop technology that is similar to or better than ours 
new product and materials introductions by our competitors or by new market entrants could hurt our sales 
if a particular semiconductor manufacturer or subcontract assembler selects a competitor s product or materials for a particular assembly operation  we may not be able to sell products or materials to that manufacturer or assembler for a significant period of time because manufacturers and assemblers sometimes develop lasting relations with suppliers  and assembly equipment in our industry often goes years without requiring replacement 
in addition  we may have to lower our prices in response to price cuts by our competitors  which may materially and adversely affect our 
table of contents business  financial condition and operating results 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete in these or other areas in the future 
if we cannot compete successfully  we could be forced to reduce prices  lose customers and market share and experience reduced margins and profitability 
our success depends in part on our intellectual property  which we may be unable to protect our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
to protect this technology  we rely principally on contractual restrictions such as nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions in our agreements with employees  vendors  consultants and customers and on the common law of trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we also rely  in some cases  on patent and copyright protection 
we may not be successful in protecting our technology for a number of reasons  including employees  vendors  consultants and customers may violate their contractual agreements  and the cost of enforcing those agreements may be prohibitive  or those agreements may be unenforceable or more limited than we anticipate  foreign intellectual property laws may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights  and our patent and copyright claims may not be sufficiently broad to effectively protect our technology  our patents or copyrights may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or we may otherwise be unable to obtain adequate protection for our technology 
in addition  our partners and alliances may also have rights to technology that we develop through these alliances 
we may incur significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitive position may be weakened 
third parties may claim we are infringing on their intellectual property  which could cause us to incur significant litigation costs or other expenses  or prevent us from selling some of our products the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  with frequent introductions of new products and technologies 
industry participants often develop products and features similar to those introduced by others  creating a risk that their products and processes may give rise to claims that they infringe on the intellectual property of others 
we may unknowingly infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and incur significant liability for that infringement 
if we are found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others  we could be enjoined from continuing to manufacture  market or use the affected product  or be required to obtain a license to continue manufacturing or using the affected product 
a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical 
occasionally  third parties assert that we are  or may be  infringing on or misappropriating their intellectual property rights 
in these cases  we will defend against claims or negotiate licenses where we consider these actions appropriate 
intellectual property cases are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
if we become involved in this type of litigation  it could consume significant resources and divert our attention from our business 
some of our customers are parties to litigation brought by the lemelson medical  education and research foundation limited partnership the lemelson foundation  in which the lemelson foundation claims that certain manufacturing processes used by those customers infringe patents held by the lemelson foundation 
we have never been named a party to any such litigation 
some customers have requested that we indemnify them to the extent their liability for these claims arises from use of our equipment 
we do not believe that products sold by us infringe valid lemelson patents 
if a claim for contribution were to be brought against us  we believe we would have valid defenses to assert and also would have rights to contribution and claims against our suppliers 
we have not incurred any material liability with respect to the lemelson claims or any other pending intellectual property claim and we do not believe that these claims will materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
the ultimate outcome of any infringement or misappropriation claim that might be made  however  is uncertain and we cannot assure you that the resolution of any such claim would not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents we may be materially and adversely affected by environmental and safety laws and regulations we are subject to various and frequently changing federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  use  emission  discharge  transportation and disposal of hazardous material  investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and the health and safety of our employees 
increasingly  public attention has focused on the environmental impact of manufacturing operations and the risk to neighbors of chemical releases from such operations 
proper waste disposal plays an important role in the operation of our manufacturing plants 
in many of our facilities we maintain wastewater treatment systems that remove metals and other contaminants from process wastewater 
these facilities operate under effluent discharge permits that must be renewed periodically 
a violation of those permits may lead to revocation of the permits  fines  penalties or the incurrence of capital or other costs to comply with the permits  including potential shutdown of operations 
in the future  applicable land use and environmental regulations may impose upon us the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements  restrict our ability to expand our operations  subject us to liability for  among other matters  remediation  and or cause us to curtail our operations 
we cannot assure you that any costs or liabilities associated with complying with these environmental laws will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
other risks we may be unable to sell our flip chip business we previously announced our intention to sell our flip chip business  if satisfactory arrangements can be negotiated 
if we are unable to accomplish that sale  we will either continue to operate the flip chip business  which has not been profitable to date  or close it  which could result in significant closure costs 
we have significant intangible assets and goodwill  which we are required to evaluate annually in fiscal  we recorded a substantial write down of goodwill 
however  our financial statements continue to reflect significant intangible assets and goodwill 
as discussed under management s discussion and analysis  we are required to perform an impairment test at least annually to support the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets 
should we be required to recognize additional intangible or goodwill impairment charges  our financial condition would be adversely affected 
anti takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and pennsylvania law may discourage other companies from attempting to acquire us some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of pennsylvania law may discourage some transactions where we would otherwise experience a change in control 
for example  our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that classify our board of directors into four classes  with one class being elected each year  permit our board to issue blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval  and prohibit us from engaging in some types of business combinations with a holder of or more of our voting securities without super majority board or stockholder approval
