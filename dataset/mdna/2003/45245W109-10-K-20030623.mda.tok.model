item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein and below under the overview and risk factors section of item  we have restated our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and all amounts included in this discussion and analysis reflect the effects of the restatement 
the following discussion and analysis by our management is provided to identify certain significant factors that affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
critical accounting policies during january  the securities and exchange commission the sec published a commission statement in the form of financial reporting release no 
 which requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical revenue recognition we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
in the fourth quarter of with an effective date of january   implementing a change in accounting policy with respect to revenue recognition 
beginning january   non refundable fees received upon entering into collaborative agreements in which the company has continuing involvement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
payments received under the development  promotion  distribution and supply agreement the commercial agreement dated september  and as amended on march   with bristol myers squibb company bms and er squibb sons  llc  and a wholly owned subsidiary of bms llc squibb  relating to erbitux  are being deferred and recognized as revenue based upon the actual product research and development costs incurred since september  to date by bms  er squibb and imclone systems as a percentage of the estimated total of such costs to be incurred over the term of the agreement 
of the  in upfront payments we received from bms through december   approximately  was recognized as revenue during the year ended december  and  from the commencement of the commercial agreement through december  the methodology used to recognize deferred revenue involves a number of estimates and judgments  such as the estimate of total product research and development costs to be incurred under the commercial agreement 
changes in these estimates and judgments can have a significant effect on the amount and timing of revenue recognition 
non refundable milestone payments  which represent the achievement of a significant step in the research and development process  pursuant to collaborative agreements other than the commercial agreement  are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the specified milestone 
withholding taxes the estimated amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include penalties and interest that may be imposed with respect to the withholding tax issues described below and other related contingencies  including the period covered by the statue of limitations and our determination of certain exercise dates because we do not believe that losses from such contingencies are probable 
with respect to the statute of limitations and our determination of certain exercise dates  while we do not believe a loss is probable  there is a potential additional liability with respect to these issues that may be asserted by a taxing authority 
however  if our assessment of these withholding tax issues and other related contingencies is incorrect  the liability that could be imposed by taxing authorities may be substantial 
the potential interest on the withholding tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet could be up to a maximum amount of  at december  potential additional withholding tax liability on other related contingencies amount to approximately  exclusive of any interest or penalties  and excluding the amount potentially attributable to mr 
goldhammer noted below 
production costs the costs associated with the manufacture of erbitux are included in research and development expenses when incurred and will continue to be so classified until such time as erbitux may be approved for sale or until we obtain binding obligations from our corporate partners for commercial supply of such product 
in the event of such approval or obligations from our corporate partners  the subsequent costs associated with manufacturing erbitux for commercial sale will be included in inventory and expensed as cost of goods sold at the time of sale 
if erbitux is approved by the united states food and drug administration fda  any subsequent sale of this inventory that was previously expensed will result in revenue from product sales with no corresponding cost of goods sold 
litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in contingencies  note to our consolidated financial statements and item legal proceedings of this form k 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 no reserve has been established in our financial statements for these legal proceedings because the company does not believe that a loss is probable 
however  if in a future period events in any such legal proceedings render it probable that a loss will be incurred  and if such loss is reasonably estimable at that time  we will establish such a reserve 
thus  it is possible that legal proceedings discussed in contingencies  note  may have a material adverse impact on the operating results for that period 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered 
assets are considered to be impaired and written down to fair value if expected associated undiscounted cash flows are less than carrying amounts 
fair value is generally determined as the present value of the expected associated cash flows 
we recently built a single product facility  are building a multiple product facility  purchased a material logistics and warehousing facility and purchased an administrative facility  all of which are summarized in property  plant and equipment note to the consolidated financial statements and item properties to this form k 
the single product facility is dedicated to the clinical and commercial production of erbitux and the multiple product facility will be a multi use production facility 
erbitux is currently being produced for clinical trials and potential commercialization 
the material logistics and warehousing facility includes office space  a storage location and sampling laboratory for erbitux 
the newly renovated administrative facility houses the clinical  regulatory  sales  marketing  finance  human resources  project management and mis departments  as well as certain executive and legal offices and other necessities 
if erbitux is ultimately approved for commercialization  the full carrying values of the single product facility  the multiple product facility  the material logistics and warehouse facility and the administrative facility will be recovered 
changes in regulatory or other business conditions in the future could change our judgments about the carrying value of these facilities  which could result in the recognition of material impairment losses 
manufacturing contracts as summarized under contract services  note to the consolidated financial statements and item business manufacturing of this form k  we have entered into certain development and manufacturing services agreements with lonza biologics plc lonza for the clinical and commercial production of erbitux 
we have commitments from lonza to manufacture erbitux at the  liter scale through december as of december   the estimated remaining future commitments under the amended commercial manufacturing services agreement with lonza were  if erbitux were not to receive regulatory approval  it is possible that a liability would need to be recognized for any remaining commitments to lonza 
valuation of stock options and warrants we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
and related interpretations in accounting for our stock options and warrants 
accordingly  compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant of an option to an employee or member of the board of directors only if the fair market value of the underlying stock at the time of grant exceeds the exercise price 
no options have been granted with an exercise price less than the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
in addition  we have granted options to certain scientific advisory board members and outside consultants  which are required to be measured at fair value and recognized as compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
estimating the fair value of stock options and warrants involves a number of judgments and variables that are subject to significant change 
a change in the fair value estimate could have a significant effect on the amount of compensation expense recognized 
recently issued statements of financial accounting standards in august  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations was issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb and was effective for us in the first quarter of the year ending december  the new rule requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  a cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
to settle the liability  the obligation for its recorded amount is paid or a gain or loss upon settlement is incurred 
management is analyzing this requirement and does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for restructuring costs  which applies to costs associated with an exit activity including restructuring or with a disposal of long lived assets 
those activities can include eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts  and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
under sfas no 
 a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit  disposal or other covered activity when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
sfas no 
will require a company to disclose information about its exit  disposal and other covered activities  the related costs  and changes in those costs in the notes to the interim and annual financial statements that include the period in which an exit activity is initiated and in any subsequent period until the activity is completed 
sfas no 
is effective prospectively for exit  disposal or other covered activities initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires a guarantor to recognize a liability at the inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee and include more detailed disclosure with respect to guarantees 
fin is effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  the initial adoption of this accounting pronouncement will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
overview and risk factors we are a biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to advance oncology care by developing a portfolio of targeted biologic treatments  which address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancer 
our three primary programs include growth factor blockers  angiogenesis inhibitors and cancer vaccines 
since our inception in april  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to research and development conducted on our own behalf and through collaborations with corporate partners and academic research and clinical institutions 
we have not derived any revenue from commercial product sales 
as a result of our substantial research and development costs  we have incurred significant operating losses and have generated an accumulated deficit of approximately  as of december  we expect to incur additional operating losses  which could be substantial 
substantially all of our revenues were generated from collaborative arrangements with our partners 
such revenues  as well as our results of operations  have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period due to several factors  including but not limited to the status of development of our various product candidates the time at which we enter into collaborative arrangements with corporate partners that provide for payments to us  and the timing and accounting treatment of payments to us under these agreements whether or not we achieve specified research or commercialization milestones timely payment by our corporate partners of amounts payable to us the addition or termination of research programs or funding support variations in the level of expenses related to our proprietary product candidates during any given period to be commercialized  our product candidates will require additional development and clinical testing 
generally  to make a profit we will need to successfully develop  test  introduce and market our products at an adequate price 
it is not certain that any of our products will be successfully developed or that required regulatory approvals to commercialize them can be obtained 
moreover  even if we successfully develop a product  there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully manufacture or market that product or that potential customers will buy it if  for example  a competitive product is deemed more cost effective 
additionally  the process of obtaining requisite fda approval has historically been costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug or biological product to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of pre clinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  filing with the fda of an ind  to conduct human clinical trials for drugs or biologics  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical investigations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its recommended use  and filing by a company and acceptance and approval by the fda of a new drug application nda for a drug product or a biological license application bla for a biological product to allow commercial distribution of the drug or biologic 
overall  conducting clinical trials is a lengthy  time consuming  expensive and risky process 
in december  we entered into a development and license agreement with merck kgaa  a germany based drug company  relating to the development  marketing and sale of erbitux 
under the terms of this agreement which was subsequently amended in august  as discussed below we retained the rights to develop and market erbitux within the united states and canada which we subsequently licensed  in part  to bms and er squibb pursuant to the terms of the commercial agreement we granted merck kgaa exclusive rights  except in japan  to develop and market erbitux outside of the united states and canada  we agreed to supply merck kgaa  and merck kgaa agreed to purchase from us  erbitux for conducting clinical trials and the commercialization of the product outside of the united states and canada which we are now currently supplying to merck kgaa  and merck kgaa is currently purchasing from us  we along with er squibb pursuant to the terms of the commercial agreement  will co develop and co market erbitux in japan  either together or co exclusively with merck kgaa  and we granted merck kgaa an exclusive license outside of the united states and canada  without the right to sublicense  to certain of our patents to apply to a humanized antibody to the egf receptor that merck kgaa currently has in development 
in return  merck kgaa has paid us  in up front fees and early cash based milestone payments based upon our achievement of the milestones set forth in the agreement  has agreed  subject to the terms of the agreement  to pay us an additional  if further milestones are achieved  for which merck kgaa will receive equity in imclone systems that will be priced at varying premiums to the then market price of our common stock depending upon the timing of the achievement of the respective milestones 
the first equity based milestone was achieved and we received  in the second equity based milestone was recently achieved and we received  on may  the third equity based milestone was recently achieved and we received  on june   is funding clinical development of erbitux outside of the united states and canada  except in japan where co exclusive development rights exist  and will pay us royalties on future sales of erbitux in its territory  if any 
this agreement may be terminated by merck kgaa in various instances  including at its discretion on any date on which a milestone is achieved in which case no milestone payment will be made  or for a one year period after first commercial sale of erbitux in merck kgaa s territory  upon merck kgaa s reasonable determination that the product is economically unfeasible in which case merck kgaa is entitled to receive back of the up front fees and cash based milestone payments then paid to date  but only out of revenues received  if any  based upon a royalty rate applied to the gross profit from erbitux sales or a percentage of erbitux fees and royalties from a sublicensee on account of the sale of erbitux in the united states and canada 
in august  we and merck kgaa amended this agreement to provide  among other things  that merck kgaa may manufacture erbitux for supply in its territory and may utilize a third party to do so upon our reasonable acceptance 
the amendment further released merck kgaa from its obligations under the agreement relating to providing a guaranty under a  credit facility relating to the build out of our single product facility 
in addition  the amendment provides that the companies have co exclusive rights to develop erbitux in japan  including the right to sublicense  and merck kgaa waived its right of first offer in the case of a proposed sublicense by us of rights to erbitux in our territory 
we also agreed to a reduction in royalties payable by merck kgaa on sales of erbitux in merck kgaa s territory 
as of december   we had received  in up front fees and cash based milestone payments 
in august  we received our first equity based milestone payment totaling  and accordingly issued to merck kgaa  shares of our common stock 
the number of shares issued for this milestone payment was determined using a price of per share 
on april   merck kgaa was issued an import license by the regierungspraesidium darmstadt for the import of erbitux into germany 
issuance of this license constituted our achievement of a second equity based milestone that triggered a payment by merck kgaa of  which we received on may  upon receipt of this payment  we issued to merck kgaa  shares of imclone systems common stock at a price of per share  representing the sale of these shares at a ten percent premium to market value as provided in the license 
as stated above  on may   we achieved a third equity based milestone when merck kgaa acknowledged that the results of a phase ii study sponsored by merck kgaa in patients with chemotherapy naive non small cell lung cancer enabled the further development of erbitux in the european union for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer 
the achievement of this third equity based milestone triggered a payment by merck kgaa of  which we received on june  upon receipt of this payment  we issued to merck kgaa  shares of our common stock  based upon a price of per share  representing the sale of these shares at a ten percent premium to market value as provided in the license 
of the cash based milestone payments received through december    was received and recognized as revenue in the year ended december  a total of  was received prior to january  and originally recorded as fees potentially refundable to corporate partner and not as revenue due to the fact that they were refundable to merck kgaa in the event a condition relating to obtaining certain collateral license agreements was not satisfied by us 
in march  this condition was satisfied and we recognized  in milestone payments as revenue during the three months ended march  the remaining  represents the up front payment associated with the agreement and has been recorded as deferred revenue 
this revenue is being recognized ratably over the anticipated life of the agreement 
we recognized approximately  of the up front payment as revenue during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recognized revenue of approximately  representing the excess of the amount paid by merck kgaa for these shares over the fair value of our common stock 
we have also granted merck kgaa a license  with the right to sublicense  to make  have made  use  sell  or have sold bec and the recombinant gp antigen outside north america 
the agreement also grants merck kgaa a license  without the right to sublicense  to use  sell  or have sold  but not to make  bec within north america in conjunction with us 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we have retained the rights  without the right to sublicense  to make  have made  use  sell  or have sold bec in north america in conjunction with merck kgaa and with the right to sublicense  to make  have made  use  sell  or have sold gp antigen in north america 
in return  merck kgaa has made research support payments to us totaling  and is required to make milestone payments to us of up to  of which  has been received through december  in addition  merck kgaa is required to make royalty payments to us on any sales of bec or gp antigen outside north america  with a portion of the milestone and research support payments received under the agreement being creditable against the amount of royalties due 
on september   we entered into an acquisition agreement the acquisition agreement with bms and bristol myers squibb biologics company  a delaware corporation bms biologics which is a wholly owned subsidiary of bms  providing for the tender offer by bms biologics to purchase up to  shares of our common stock for per share  net to the seller in cash 
the tender offer by bms biologics  available to all shareholders  allowed for our then current employees and directors who held exercisable options to purchase shares of our common stock having exercise prices less than per share to conditionally exercise any or all of those options and tender the underlying shares in the tender offer 
in connection with the acquisition agreement  we entered into a stockholder agreement with bms and bms biologics  dated as of september  the stockholder agreement  pursuant to which all parties agreed to various arrangements regarding the respective rights and obligations of each party with respect to  among other things  the ownership of shares of our common stock by bms and bms biologics 
concurrently with the execution of the acquisition agreement and the stockholder agreement  we entered into the commercial agreement with bms and er squibb  relating to erbitux  pursuant to which  among other things  we are co developing and co promoting erbitux in the united states and canada  and co developing erbitux either together or co exclusively with merck kgaa in japan 
on march   we amended the commercial agreement with er squibb and bms 
the amendment changed certain economics of the commercial agreement and has expanded the clinical and strategic role of bms in the erbitux development program 
one of the principal economic changes to the commercial agreement is that we received  on march  and an additional payment of  on march  such payments are in lieu of the  payment we would have received on acceptance by the fda of the erbitux bla under the original terms of the commercial agreement 
in addition  we agreed to resume  and have resumed  construction of our multiple product facility 
the terms of the commercial agreement  as amended on march   are set forth in more detail in item business to this form k 
on october   pursuant to the acquisition agreement  bms biologics accepted for payment pursuant to the tender offer  shares our common stock on a pro rata basis from all tendering shareholders and those conditionally exercising stock options 
the terms of the acquisition agreement are set forth in more detail in item business to this form k 
among other things  the stockholder agreement described in greater detail in item business to this form k gave bms the right to nominate two initial directors to our board of directors and also set forth bms s i limitation on additional purchases of shares  ii option to purchase shares in the event of dilution and iii restrictions as to transfer of shares 
in exchange for the rights granted to bms under the amended commercial agreement  we can receive up front and milestone payments totaling  in the aggregate  of which  was received on september    was received on march    was received on march    is payable upon receipt of marketing approval from the fda with respect to an initial indication for erbitux and  is payable upon receipt of marketing approval from the fda with respect to a second indication for erbitux 
all such payments are non refundable and non creditable 
except for our expenses incurred pursuant to the co promotion option that we have exercised  er squibb is also responsible for of the distribution  sales and marketing costs in the united states and canada  and as between imclone systems and er squibb  each is responsible for of the distribution  sales  marketing costs and other related costs and expenses in japan 
the commercial agreement provides that er squibb shall pay us distribution fees based on a percentage of annual sales of erbitux by er squibb in the united states and canada 
the distribution fee is of net sales in the united states and canada 
the commercial agreement also provides that the distribution fees for the sale of erbitux in japan by er squibb or us shall be equal to of the operating profit or loss with respect to such sales for any calendar month 
in the event of an operating profit  er squibb will pay us the amount of such distribution fee  and in the event of an operating loss  we will credit er squibb the amount of such distribution fee 
the commercial agreement provides that we are responsible for the manufacture and supply of all requirements of erbitux in bulk form for clinical and commercial use in the united states  canada and japan and that er squibb will purchase all of its requirements of erbitux in bulk form for commercial use from us 
we are supplying erbitux for clinical use at our fully burdened manufacturing cost  and will supply erbitux for commercial use at our fully burdened manufacturing cost plus a mark up of 
in addition to the up front and milestone payments  the distribution fees for the united states  canada and japan and the mark up on the commercial supply of erbitux  the commercial agreement provides that er squibb is responsible for of the cost of all clinical studies other than those studies undertaken post launch which are not pursuant to an investigational new drug application ind eg phase iv studies  the cost of which will be shared equally between er squibb and imclone systems 
as between er squibb and imclone systems  each is responsible for of the cost of all clinical studies in japan 
we have also agreed  and may agree in the future  to share with er squibb  on terms other than the foregoing  the costs of clinical trials that we believe are not potentially registrational but should be undertaken prior to launch in the united states  canada or japan 
unless earlier terminated pursuant to the termination rights discussed below  the commercial agreement expires with regard to erbitux in each country in the territory on the later of september  or the date on which the sale of erbitux ceases to be covered by a validly issued or pending patent in such country 
the commercial agreement may also be terminated prior to such expiration as follows by either party  in the event that the other party materially breaches any of its material obligations under the commercial agreement and has not cured such breach within days after notice  by er squibb  if the joint executive committee the jec determines that there exists a significant concern regarding a regulatory or patient safety issue that would seriously impact the long term viability of all products  or by either party  in the event that the jec does not approve additional clinical studies that are required by the fda in connection with the submission of the initial regulatory filing with the fda within days of receiving the formal recommendation of the product development committee the pdc concerning such additional clinical studies

federal and applicable state tax laws require an employer to withhold income taxes at the time of an employee s exercise of non qualified stock options or warrants issued in connection with the performance of services by the employee 
an employer that does not do so is liable for the taxes not withheld if the employee fails to pay his or her taxes for the year in which the non qualified stock options or warrants are exercised 
in and prior years  we generally did not require the withholding of federal  state or local income taxes and in certain years  employment payroll taxes at the time of the exercise of non qualified stock options or warrants 
prior to  we did not comply with tax reporting requirements with respect to the exercise of non qualified stock options or warrants 
in january  the new york state department of taxation and finance new york state notified us that we were liable for the new york state and city income taxes that were not withheld because one or more of our employees who exercised certain non qualified stock options in and failed to pay new york state and city income taxes for those years 
at december   we have recorded a gross new york state and city withholding tax liability of approximately  on march   we entered into a closing agreement with new york state  paying  to settle the matter 
we believe that substantially all of the underpayment of new york state and city income tax identified by new york state is attributable to the exercise of non qualified stock options by our former president and chief executive officer  dr 
samuel d 
waksal 
on march   we initiated discussions with the internal revenue service the irs relating to federal income taxes on the exercise of non qualified stock options on which income tax was not properly withheld 
although the irs has not yet asserted that we are required to make a payment with respect to such failure to withhold  the irs may assert that such a liability exists  and may further assert that we are liable for interest and penalties 
we have requested and received confirmation from all of our current and substantially all of our former employees who exercised non qualified stock options in and  on which no income tax was withheld  that they have reported the appropriate amount of income on their tax returns and paid the taxes shown as due on those returns 
based on this information  we determined that all but an insignificant amount of the potential liability for withholding taxes with respect to exercises of non qualified stock options in and is attributed to those amounts related to dr 
samuel d 
waksal 
in addition  in the course of our investigation into our potential liability in respect of the non qualified stock options described above  we identified certain warrants that were granted in and prior years to current and former officers  directors and advisors including the four individuals discussed below that we previously treated as non compensatory warrants and thus not subject to tax withholding and information reporting requirements upon exercise 
accordingly  when exercised in and prior years  we did not deduct income and payroll taxes upon exercise or report applicable information to the taxing authorities 
based on the information discovered in the course of our recent investigation  we now believe that such treatment was incorrect  and that the exercise of such warrants by current and former officers of the company should have been treated in the same manner for withholding and reporting purposes as the exercise of non qualified stock options 
we have informed the relevant authorities  including the irs and new york state  of this matter and intend to resolve our liability in respect of these warrants with these taxing authorities in conjunction with our resolution of the matters described above 
on june   new york state notified us that  based on the issue identified above  they are continuing a previously conducted audit of the company and are evaluating the terms of the closing agreement to determine whether or not it should be re opened 
on april   we received a request from the sec for the voluntary production of documents and information relating to the above matters 
we are cooperating fully with the sec  and intend to continue to do so  while also updating the united states attorney s office on an ongoing basis 
one of the officers and directors to whom warrants were issued and previously treated as non compensatory warrants is dr 
harlan w 
waksal  our chief scientific officer 
in june  dr 
harlan w 
waksal represented to us that he has paid the taxes associated with the exercise of these warrants and further agreed to indemnify us for any withholding taxes that may be assessed and are attributable to our failure to deduct income and payroll taxes on all warrants and options that he or his transferee has previously exercised  subject to the consent of dr 
harlan w 
waksal  which cannot be unreasonably withheld 
two of the other officers and directors to whom warrants were issued and previously treated as non compensatory warrants are dr 
samuel d 
waksal and our former general counsel  john b 
landes 
we have made demands on both of these individuals to pay the taxes associated with the exercise of these warrants and certain non qualified stock options and to indemnify us against any liability that we may incur to taxing authorities in respect of the warrants or non qualified stock options that they have previously exercised 
the company has recognized assets at the time of exercise relating to the above individuals 
these assets are based on the fact that individuals are required by law to pay their personal income taxes  as well as our determination that these individuals had the means and intention to satisfy their tax liabilities and legal claims we have against these individuals both during and after their employment with the company 
we decided to write down these assets during the periods noted in the paragraph below 
regarding dr 
samuel d 
waksal  we determined that subsequent to our receipt of the refusal to file letter  his financial condition deteriorated and therefore the recoverability of the asset became doubtful 
regarding mr 
landes  based on the limited information available to us  due to the decrease in our stock price during and corresponding decrease in the value of mr 
landes ownership of our securities  we determined that recoverability of the asset became doubtful 
based upon these determinations  the asset write downs of  and  were recorded during the fourth quarter of for dr 
samuel d 
waksal and the second quarter of for mr 
landes  respectively 
the withholding tax liabilities relating to dr 
samuel d 
waksal and mr 
landes will remain on our consolidated balance sheets  until such time as these liabilities are satisfied 
should we negotiate settlements with the irs and new york state tax authorities for amounts less than those noted above  we would reduce operating expenses for the difference between the withholding tax liabilities and settlement amounts in the period of settlement 
we have not recognized withholding tax liabilities in respect of exercises of certain warrants by our then current and now former chairman of the board  robert f 
goldhammer  the final of the four aforementioned officers or directors to whom warrants were issued and previously treated as non compensatory warrants 
based on our investigation  we believe that  although such warrants were compensatory  such warrants were received by mr 
goldhammer in connection with the performance of services by him in his capacity as a director  rather than as an employee  and  as such  are not subject to tax withholding requirements 
in addition  in  mr 
goldhammer erroneously received a portion of a stock option grant to him in the form of incentive stock options  which under federal law may only be granted to employees 
there can be no assurance  however  that the taxing authorities will agree with our position and will not assert that we are liable for the failure to withhold income and employment taxes with respect to the exercise of such warrants by mr 
goldhammer 
if we became liable for the failure to withhold these taxes on the exercise of such warrants and any stock options by mr 
goldhammer  the potential liability  exclusive of any interest or penalties  would be approximately in april  we discovered that we are in breach of certain covenants of our outstanding industrial development revenue bonds issued in the ida bonds 
these bonds are tax exempt and we are required to continue to use the proceeds for a qualified tax exempt purpose in this case  manufacturing  until maturity 
these bonds  in principal amount of  bearing annual interest  mature on may  while the bond proceeds were originally used for manufacturing purposes  a recent internal investigation concluded that in august  this qualified purpose was abandoned and the proceeds have been used for a non qualified purpose in later periods 
as a result  the bond proceeds likely became taxable to the bondholders in august we are required to indemnify the bondholders from any taxes imposed upon them 
we intend to attempt to settle any tax liability directly with the relevant taxing authorities using procedures established for that purpose 
based on our understanding of these procedures  we have recognized a tax liability of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheet 
we recorded industrial development revenue bond tax expense of  for the years ended december   and and interest expense of   and  for the same periods  respectively 
on may   we notified the bond trustee of its intent to redeem in full the bonds by repaying the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
this redemption is scheduled to occur on june  as part of our investigation into the matters discussed above regarding our tax liability in respect of the exercise of non qualified stock options and warrants  the independent members of our board of directors concluded that a change in executive and board leadership was appropriate 
as a result  on april   mr 
goldhammer resigned as chairman of the board of directors and announced that he will not stand for re election to the board at the next annual shareholders meeting 
mr

due to our inability to timely file this annual report on form k  as required by nasdaq marketplace rule c  on april   we received a letter from nasdaq stating that our securities are subject to delisting from nasdaq 
in addition  we were informed that the trading symbol for our common stock would be changed from imcl to imcle 
we appealed the delisting of our securities  and  after a hearing before the nasdaq listing qualifications panel the panel  we received a written determination from the panel regarding our listing status 
the panel s determination provided for the continued listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market subject to our satisfying certain requirements 
these requirements include  but are not limited to  meeting the following deadlines filing this annual report on form k on or before june   filing our first quarter report on form q on or before july   and issuing a press release on or before june   updating our previously disclosed estimates of the financial statement impact of certain option and warrant exercises by current and former officers  directors and employees 
we are filing this annual report on form k on or prior to june  and issued the required press release on june  on june   we received notification that the panel s decision was called for review by the nasdaq listing hearing and review council the review council 
following this notification  on june   we received notification from the review council that it had vacated  on the basis that it was premature  a portion of the panel s decision pertaining to a determination of the company s intent with respect to the tax liability issues and associated accounting matters discussed herein 
the review council affirmed the remainder of the panel s decision and remanded the matter to the panel for further consideration 
should we fail to meet any of the deadlines or other requirements established by the panel  our securities will be delisted 
we would then be eligible for re listing on nasdaq  at any time after being delisted  provided we are able to meet all requirements for listing on that market 
further  following such a delisting  trading in our common stock may continue to be conducted on the otc bulletin board or in a non nasdaq over the counter market  such as the pink sheets 
delisting of our common stock would result in limited access to market price data and limited news coverage of imclone systems and could restrict investors interest in our common stock 
also  a delisting could materially and adversely affect the trading market and prices for our common stock and our ability to issue additional securities or to secure additional financing 
until we file our first quarter report on form q  we would also be unable to comply with rule registration rights of an affiliated investor holding our unregistered shares who is contractually able and wished to sell those shares  which could potentially give rise to an indemnification claim for any loss of value of such stock during a period of sale postponement or to a right to terminate the corresponding contract if such non compliance were not cured in a timely manner 
on may   we informed the trustee for the convertible subordinated notes of our withholding tax issues and the delay in filing this form k and of our intention to satisfy our tax liabilities upon completion of discussions with the relevant taxing authorities and to file form k as soon as possible 
the indenture for the convertible subordinated notes includes covenants requiring us to timely pay taxes and timely make exchange act filings 
under the indenture  there can be no acceleration of payment of the notes until we receive a notice of default from the trustee or a specified percentage of the note holders and a day grace period lapses 
we have not received any such notice 
if  at some point in the future  we were to receive such a notice and if it was determined at that time that we were not in compliance with the applicable covenants  we intend to and believe we would be able to cure such non compliance within the day grace period 
restatement impact on the consolidated balance sheets we have restated our consolidated balance sheet as of december   primarily to reflect the withholding tax liabilities and withholding tax assets primarily relating to the exercises of certain non qualified stock options and warrants described above 
the restatement includes recording withholding tax assets of  a withholding tax liability of  an industrial development revenue bonds tax liability of  and a cumulative increase to accumulated deficit of  as of december  the  increase to accumulated deficit reflects the year write off of the  withholding tax asset noted above regarding samuel d 
waksal and the  expense recorded during the years through on the ida bonds 
we recorded an adjustment of  to increase accumulated deficit as of december   for the estimated taxes and accrued interest on the ida bonds and includes the cumulative expense impact from through in addition  the consolidated balance sheets as of march   june  and september  have been updated to reflect the impact of the restatement 
as noted above  we are making these quarterly changes by filing form q a reports with the sec concurrently with this form k 
restatement impact on the consolidated statements of operations we have restated our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  primarily to reflect the write off of the  withholding tax asset regarding samuel d 
waksal noted above 
the asset write down reflects the withholding taxes with respect to exercises of certain non qualified stock options and certain warrants attributable to dr 
samuel d 
waksal 
the majority of these exercise transactions occurred during the years ended december  and in addition   of expenses were recorded in connection with the ida bonds  including interest expense of the restatement amount of  for the year ended december  reflects the expenses recorded in connection with the ida bonds  including interest expense of  in addition  the consolidated statements of operations for each of the first three quarters of the years ended december  and have been restated to reflect the expenses on the ida bonds 
as a result of the restatement  an expense of approximately  was recorded for each of the quarters ended march  june  and september  and in addition  interest expense has been increased by approximately  to  per quarter for each of the quarters ended march  june  and september  and operating expenses for the fourth quarter of increased by restatement impact on the remaining consolidated financial statements see the financial statement section in part ii of this form k for the restatement impact on the consolidated statements of cash flows and the consolidated statements of stockholders equity deficit for the years ended december  and penalties  interest and other related contingencies we have not recognized accruals for penalties and interest that may be imposed with respect to the withholding tax issues described above and other related contingencies  including the period covered by the statute of limitations and our determination of certain exercise dates because we do not believe that losses from such contingencies are probable 
with respect to the statute of limitations and our determination of certain exercise dates  while we do not believe a loss is probable  there is a potential additional liability with respect to these issues that may be asserted by a taxing authority 
if taxing authorities assert such issues and prevail related to these withholding tax issues and other related contingencies  including penalties  the liability which could be imposed by taxing authorities would be substantial 
the potential interest on the withholding tax liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets could be up to a maximum amount of  at december  potential additional withholding tax liability on other related contingencies amounts to approximately  exclusive of any interest or penalties  and excluding the amount potentially attributable to mr 
goldhammer noted above 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  or in revenues for the year ended december  primarily included  in license fee revenue and  in collaborative agreement revenue from our erbitux commercial agreement with bms and its wholly owned subsidiary  er squibb 
the collaborative agreement revenue represents the fully burdened manufacturing cost of erbitux supplied for or used in clinical trials and certain research and development and marketing expenses that have been incurred by us and are reimbursable by bms as provided for in the commercial agreement 
license fee revenue from payments under this agreement are being recognized as revenue over the product research and development life of erbitux 
revenues for the year ended december  also included  in collaborative agreement revenue from our erbitux development and license agreement with merck kgaa and  of the  up front payment received upon entering into this agreement with merck kgaa 
revenues for the year ended december  also included  in royalty revenue from our strategic corporate alliance with abbott laboratories abbott in diagnostics and  in license fee revenue and  in collaborative agreement revenue from our strategic corporate alliance with merck kgaa for our principal cancer vaccine product candidate  bec revenues for the year ended december  primarily included  in milestone revenue and  in collaborative agreement revenue from our erbitux development and license agreement with merck kgaa 
in addition  revenues for the year ended december  included license fee revenue of  of the  up front payment received upon entering into this agreement 
revenues for the year ended december  also included  in royalty revenue from our strategic corporate alliance with abbott in diagnostics  as well as  in milestone revenue   in license fee revenue and  of collaborative agreement revenue from our strategic corporate alliance with merck kgaa for bec finally  revenues for the year ended december  also included  in license fee revenue and  in collaborative agreement revenue from our commercial agreement with bms and er squibb relating to erbitux 
operating expenses total operating expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  or in operating expenses included  in legal and other advisor fees associated with completing the amended commercial agreement with bms and er squibb during the year ended december   and included  in legal and other advisor fees associated with consummating each of the acquisition agreement  the stockholder agreement and the commercial agreement the bms agreements with bms and affiliates during the year ended december operating expenses research and development research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  or in research and development expenses for the years ended december  and as a percentage of total operating expenses  excluding the legal and other advisor fees associated with the amended commercial agreement and the original bms agreements  the write down of withholding tax assets and the ida bonds tax expense  in the years ended december  and  were and  respectively 
research and development expenses include costs associated with our in house and collaborative research programs  product and process development expenses  costs to manufacture our product candidates  particularly erbitux  prior to any approval that we may obtain of a product candidate for commercial sale or binding obligations of our corporate partners to acquire commercial product from us  quality assurance and quality control costs  and costs to conduct our clinical trials and associated regulatory activities 
research and development expenses include costs that are reimbursable by our corporate partners 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the costs associated with full scale production at our single product facility  costs related to the manufacturing services agreements with lonza  expenditures in the functional areas of product development and pilot plant manufacturing associated with our other monoclonal antibodies and increased expenditures associated with discovery research 
we expect research and development costs to increase in future periods as we continue to manufacture erbitux prior to any approval of the product that we may obtain for commercial use or until we receive committed purchase obligations from our corporate partners 
in the event of such approval or committed purchase obligations from our corporate partners  the subsequent costs associated with manufacturing erbitux for supply to corporate partners for commercial use will be included in inventory and expensed as cost of goods sold at the time of sale 
we expect research and development costs associated with discovery research and product development also to continue to increase in future periods 
the largest component of our total operating expenses is our ongoing investments in research and development and  in particular  the clinical development of our product pipeline 
the process of the requisite clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug or biological product to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of pre clinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  filing with the fda of an ind  to conduct human clinical trials for drugs or biologics  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical investigations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its recommended use  and filing by a company and acceptance and approval by the fda of a new drug application nda for a drug product or a biological license application bla for a biological product to allow commercial distribution of the drug or biologic 
in light of the factors mentioned above  we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to the long term success of the company 
as described in part i  we currently have three candidates in clinical development  including our most advanced candidate  erbitux 
due to the inherent risks associated with candidate discovery and development  as well as the regulatory approval process  we  by necessity  manage our overall research  development and in licensing efforts in a manner designed to generate new clinical candidates into development 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition and commercial viability 
due to these factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments assigned to any one program prior to the phase iii stage of development or the future cash inflows from these programs 
operating expenses marketing  general and administrative marketing  general and administrative expenses include marketing and administrative personnel costs  including related facility costs  additional costs to develop internal marketing and sales capabilities  costs to pursue arrangements with strategic corporate partners and technology licensors  and expenses associated with applying for patent protection for our technology and products 
marketing  general and administrative expenses also include amounts reimbursable by our corporate partners 
marketing  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  or in the increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses is attributable to the separation compensation and other post employment benefits associated with the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer  dr 
samuel d 
waksal legal expenses associated with the pending class action lawsuits  shareholder derivative lawsuits and investigations by the sec  the subcommittee on oversight and investigation of the us house of representatives committee on energy and commerce and the us department of justice  expenses associated with higher public relations costs due to the factors noted in above  expenses associated with higher insurance premiums with respect to director and officer liability insurance  the write off of an expired negotiating right with lonza and expenses associated with general corporate activities 
excluding legal  public relations and insurance expenses discussed in through above  whose level in the future is uncertain because it depends upon the manner in which these investigations and proceedings progress  and excluding the amount of the separation compensation and the amount written off for the expired negotiating right discussed in and above  we expect marketing  general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods to support our continued commercialization efforts for erbitux 
operating expenses write down of withholding tax assets and ida bonds tax expense write downs of withholding tax assets for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  a decrease of  or in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  reflects the write down of a  asset offsetting withholding tax liabilities of the same amounts incurred upon the exercise of certain non qualified stock options and certain warrants granted to our former president and chief executive officer  dr

in december  we entered into a development and manufacturing services agreement with lonza 
this agreement was amended in april to include additional services 
under the agreement  lonza is responsible for process development and scale up to manufacture erbitux in bulk form under current good manufacturing practices cgmp 
these steps were taken to assure that the manufacturing process would produce bulk material that conforms with our reference material and to support  in part  our regulatory filing with the fda 
we incurred approximately  for services provided under this agreement through december  lonza has completed its obligations under the development and manufacturing service agreement 
in september  we entered into a three year commercial manufacturing services agreement with lonza relating to erbitux 
this agreement was amended in june and again in september to include additional services 
as of december   we incurred approximately  for services provided under the commercial manufacturing services agreement 
lonza is currently manufacturing erbitux at the  liter scale under cgmp and is delivering it to us over a term ending no later than december the costs associated with both of these agreements are included in research and development expenses when incurred and will continue to be so classified until such time as erbitux may be approved for sale or until we obtain obligations from our corporate partners for commercial supply of such product 
in the event of such approval or obligations from our corporate partners  the subsequent costs associated with manufacturing erbitux for commercial sale will be included in inventory and expensed as cost of goods sold at the time of sale 
in the event we terminate ie  the cancellation of batches of bulk product the commercial manufacturing services agreement without cause  we will be required to pay of the stated costs for each of the first ten batches cancelled  of the stated costs for each of the next ten batches cancelled and of the stated costs for each of the next six batches cancelled 
the batch cancellation provisions for certain additional batches that we are committed to purchase require us to pay of the stated costs of cancelled batches scheduled within six months of the cancellation  of the stated costs of cancelled batches scheduled between six and twelve months following the cancellation and of the stated costs of cancelled batches scheduled between twelve and eighteen months following the cancellation 
these amounts are subject to mitigation should lonza use its manufacturing capacity caused by such termination for another customer 
certain batches have been cancelled at other negotiated rates agreed to by the parties 
at december   the estimated remaining future commitments under the amended commercial manufacturing services agreement were  in december  we entered into an agreement with lonza to manufacture erbitux at the  liter scale for use in clinical trials by merck kgaa 
we had incurred approximately  for services provided under this agreement 
during  merck kgaa reimbursed the company this entire obligation 
at december   there are no remaining future commitments under this agreement 
on january   we executed a letter of intent with lonza to enter into a long term supply agreement 
the long term supply agreement would apply to a large scale manufacturing facility that lonza is constructing  which would be able to produce erbitux in  liter batches 
we paid lonza  upon execution of the letter of intent for the exclusive right to negotiate a long term supply agreement for a portion of the facility s manufacturing capacity 
in september  we wrote off the deposit because the exclusive negotiation period ended on september  the  is included in marketing  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in light of the assistance we provided to a third party with respect to preserving and then relinquishing the manufacturing capacity described above  the third party paid us  in april and this amount will therefore be recognized as a reduction to operating expenses in effective april  we entered into a development and commercialization agreement with merck kgaa with respect to bec and the recombinant gp antigen 
the agreement has been amended a number of times  most recently in december the agreement grants merck kgaa a license  with the right to sublicense  to make  have made  use  sell  or have sold bec and gp antigen outside north america

in december  we entered into a development and license agreement with merck kgaa with respect to erbitux 
in exchange for granting merck kgaa exclusive rights to market erbitux outside of the united states and canada and co development rights in japan  we received through december    in up front fees and early cash based milestone payments based on the achievement of defined milestones 
an additional  could be received  depending upon the achievement of further milestones for which merck kgaa receives equity in imclone systems 
of this additional   had been received as of december  and  was received on may  as stated above  on may   we achieved a third equity based milestone when merck kgaa acknowledged that the results of a phase ii study sponsored by merck kgaa in patients with chemotherapy naive non small cell lung cancer enabled the further development of erbitux in the european union for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer 
the achievement of this third equity based milestone triggered a payment by merck kgaa of  which we received on june  upon receipt of this payment  we issued to merck kgaa  shares of our common stock  based upon a price of per share  representing the sale of these shares at a ten percent premium to market value as provided in the license 
the equity underlying these milestone payments have been or will be priced at varying premiums to the then market price of the common stock depending upon the timing of the achievement of the respective milestones

in august  imclone systems and merck kgaa amended this agreement to provide  among other things  that merck kgaa may manufacture erbitux for supply in its territory and may utilize a third party to do so upon imclone systems reasonable acceptance 
the amendment further released merck kgaa from its obligations under the agreement relating to providing a guaranty under a  credit facility relating to the build out of our single product facility 
in addition  the amendment provides that the companies have co exclusive rights to develop erbitux in japan  including the right to sublicense and merck kgaa waived its right of first offer in the case of a proposed sublicense by imclone systems of erbitux in imclone systems territory 
in consideration for the amendment  we agreed to a reduction in royalties payable by merck kgaa on sales of erbitux in merck kgaa s territory 
in september  we entered into a binding term sheet  effective as of april   with merck kgaa for the supply of erbitux

we incurred legal fees totaling  during the year ended december  in addition  we have estimated and recorded a receivable totaling  for a portion of the above mentioned legal fees that we believe are recoverable from our insurance carriers 
this receivable is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet at december  federal and applicable state tax laws require an employer to withhold income taxes at the time of an employee s exercise of non qualified stock options or warrants issued in connection with the performance of services by the employee 
an employer that does not do so is liable for the taxes not withheld if the employee fails to pay his or her taxes for the year in which the non qualified stock options or warrants are exercised 
in and prior years  we generally did not require the withholding of federal  state or local income taxes and in certain years  employment payroll taxes at the time of the exercise of non qualified stock options or warrants 
prior to  we did not comply with tax reporting requirements with respect to the exercise of non qualified stock options or warrants 
in january  the new york state department of taxation and finance new york state notified us that we were liable for the new york state and city income taxes that were not withheld because one or more of our employees who exercised certain non qualified stock options in and failed to pay new york state and city income taxes for those years 
at december   we have recorded a gross new york state and city withholding tax liability of approximately  on march   we entered into a closing agreement with new york state  paying  to settle the matter 
we believe that substantially all of the underpayment of new york state and city income tax identified by new york state is attributable to the exercise of non qualified stock options by our former president and chief executive officer  dr 
samuel d 
waksal 
on march   we initiated discussions with the irs relating to federal income taxes on the exercise of non qualified stock options on which income tax was not properly withheld 
although the irs has not yet asserted that we are required to make a payment with respect to such failure to withhold  the irs may assert that such a liability exists  and may further assert that we are liable for interest and penalties 
we have requested and received confirmation from all of our current and substantially all of our former employees who exercised non qualified stock options in and  on which no income tax was withheld  that they have reported the appropriate amount of income on their tax returns and paid the taxes shown as due on those returns 
based on this information  we determined that all but an insignificant amount of the potential liability for withholding taxes with respect to exercises of non qualified stock options in and is attributed to those amounts related to dr 
samuel d 
waksal 
in addition  in the course of our investigation into our potential liability in respect of the non qualified stock options described above  we identified certain warrants that were granted in and prior years to current and former officers  directors and advisors including the four individuals discussed below that we previously treated as non compensatory warrants and thus not subject to tax withholding and information reporting requirements upon exercise 
accordingly  when exercised in and prior years  we did not deduct income and payroll taxes upon exercise or report applicable information to the taxing authorities 
based on the information discovered in the course of our recent investigation  we now believe that such treatment was incorrect  and that the exercise of such warrants by current and former officers of the company should have been treated in the same manner for withholding and reporting purposes as the exercise of non qualified stock options 
we have informed the relevant authorities  including the irs and new york state  of this matter and intend to resolve our liability in respect of these warrants with these taxing authorities in conjunction with our resolution of the matter described above 
on june   new york state notified us that  based on the issue identified above  they are continuing a previously conducted audit of the company and are evaluating the terms of the closing agreement to determine whether or not it should be re opened 
on april   we received a request from the sec for the voluntary production of documents and information relating to the above matters 
we are cooperating fully with the sec  and intend to continue to do so  while also updating the united states attorney s office on an ongoing basis 
one of the officers and directors to whom warrants were issued and previously treated as non compensatory warrants is dr 
harlan w 
waksal  the company s chief scientific officer 
in june  dr 
harlan w 
waksal represented that he has paid the taxes associated with the exercise of these warrants and further agreed to indemnify the company for any withholding taxes that may be assessed and are attributable to our failure to deduct income and payroll taxes on all warrants and options that he or his transferee have previously exercised  subject to the consent of dr 
harlan w 
waksal  which cannot be unreasonably withheld 
two of the other officers and directors to whom warrants were issued and previously treated as non compensatory warrants are dr 
samuel d 
waksal  and our former general counsel  john b 
landes 
we have made demands on both of these individuals to pay the taxes associated with the exercise of these warrants and certain non qualified stock options and to indemnify us against any liability that we may incur to taxing authorities in respect of the warrants or non qualified stock options that were previously exercised 
we have not recognized withholding tax liabilities in respect of exercises of certain warrants by our then current and now former chairman of the board  robert f 
goldhammer  the final of the four officers or directors to whom warrants were issued and previously treated as non compensatory warrants 
based on our investigation  we believe that  although such warrants were compensatory  such warrants were received by mr 
goldhammer in connection with the performance of services by him in his capacity as a director  rather than as an employee  and  as such  are not subject to tax withholding requirements 
in addition  in  mr 
goldhammer erroneously received a portion of a stock option grant to him in the form of incentive stock options  which under federal law may only be granted to employees 
there can be no assurance  however  that the taxing authorities will agree with our position and will not assert that we are liable for the failure to withhold income and employment taxes with respect to the exercise of such warrants and any stock options by mr 
goldhammer 
if we became liable for the failure to withhold taxes on the exercise of such warrants and any stock options by mr 
goldhammer  the potential liability  exclusive of any interest or penalties  would be approximately  we believe that our existing cash on hand  marketable securities and amounts to which we are entitled should enable us to maintain our current and planned operations through at least june we are also entitled to reimbursement for certain marketing and research and development expenditures and certain other payments  some of which are payable contingent upon the achievement of research and development milestones 
such contingent amounts include  in cash based payments under our commercial agreement with bms and er squibb  as well as up to  in equity based milestone payments under our erbitux development and license agreement with merck kgaa and up to  in cash based milestone payments under our bec development agreement with merck kgaa 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve these milestones 
our future working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including  but not limited to progress and cost of our research and development programs  pre clinical testing and clinical trials our corporate partners fulfilling their obligations to us timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals timing and cost of manufacturing scale up and effective commercialization activities and arrangements level of resources that we devote to the development of marketing and sales capabilities costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims technological advances legal costs and the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings and investigations status of competition our ability to maintain existing corporate collaborations and establish new collaborative arrangements with other companies to provide funding to support these activities the adequacy of our estimations of liabilities for tax related matters discussed above in order to fund our capital needs after june  we may require significant levels of additional capital and we intend to raise the capital through additional arrangements with corporate partners  equity or debt financings  or from other sources 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in consummating any such arrangements 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly curtail our planned operations 
if our common stock were to be delisted by nasdaq  this may have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public markets 
below is a table that presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by year and total thereafter current portion of long term debt   long term debt  less current portion   capital lease obligations including interest operating leases        construction commitments    lonza   total contractual obligations        redemption of this debt requires payment on june  amounts in the above table do not include milestone type payments under collaborative agreements 
at december   our estimated net operating loss carryforwards for united states federal income tax purposes were approximately  which expire at various dates from through of our  in estimated net operating loss carryforwards  we have approximately  available to use in  approximately  available to use in each year from through and approximately  available to use in any of these net operating loss carryforwards which are not utilized are available for utilization in future years  subject to applicable statutory expiration dates 
new jersey state tax law changes in july  the state of new jersey nj enacted various income tax law changes  which are retroactive to january  one of the provisions of the new law is the suspension of the utilization of net operating losses for and this provision would negatively affect the company if it generates nj taxable income in and because the company would not be able to utilize its nj net operating loss carryover to offset such taxable income 
a second provision establishes the alternative minimum assessment ama which applies to companies like ours that currently pay no corporate business tax 
this provision requires that we assess an alternate tax liability with a formula that uses either reported gross receipts or gross profits as a determining factor 
we are then required to pay the greater of the regular nj corporation business tax or the ama 
the ama tax paid is creditable and can be carried forward to reduce the income tax in future periods 
we have recorded a tax provision of approximately  for the year ended december  associated with the nj ama
