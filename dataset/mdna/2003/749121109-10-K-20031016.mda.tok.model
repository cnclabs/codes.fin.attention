item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of see special note regarding forward looking statements at the end of this item for additional factors relating to such statements as well as for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
business overview we provide local telecommunications and related services  intralata long distance services and wireless  data and video services within our local service area  which consists of the state region of arizona  colorado  idaho  iowa  minnesota  montana  nebraska  new mexico  north dakota  oregon  south dakota  utah  washington and wyoming 
we provide interlata long distance services outside our local service area and switched interlata long distance services as a reseller in all states within our local service area other than arizona 
we also provide reliable  scalable and secure broadband data  voice and video communications outside our local service area as well as globally 
we previously provided directory publishing services in our local service area 
in  we entered into contracts for the sale of our directory publishing business 
in november  we closed the sale of our directory publishing business in seven of the states in which we offered these services 
in september  we completed the sale of the directory publishing business in the remaining states 
as a consequence  the results of operations of our directory publishing business are included in income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
restatement of and consolidated financial statements this report contains our restated consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and we performed an analysis of our previously issued consolidated financial statements for and and identified a number of errors 
the nature of the errors and the restatement adjustments that we have made to our financial statements for years ended december  and are described in item business impact of restatement and are set forth in note restatement of results to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the net impact of the restatement adjustments include the following december  in millions  except per share amounts revenue  loss before income taxes  discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change of accounting principle   net loss  loss per share additionally  we recorded a million adjustment to reduce january  beginning retained earnings related to our restatement of our directory publishing revenues and costs and the related deferred income tax effects 
we also recorded significant restatements in connection with our accounting for the merger 
see note merger to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for more information related to the restatements to our previously reported purchase accounting 
the restatements involve  among other matters  revenue recognition issues related to optical capacity asset transactions  equipment sales  directory publishing and purchase accounting 
in making these restatements  we have performed an internal analysis of our accounting policies  practices  procedures and disclosures for the affected periods 
please note that our consolidated financial statements do not include financial results of pre merger qwest for any period prior to the merger 
this is due to u s west being deemed the acquirer in the merger for financial statement accounting purposes 
with respect to certain categories of transactions principally the optical capacity asset transactions  we are restating these transactions only with respect to periods subsequent to june  certain of these transactions may have been accounted for by pre merger qwest under policies and practices similar to those for which post merger transactions are being restated 
results of operations overview our operating revenues are generated from our wireline  wireless and other segments 
our wireline segment includes revenues from the provision of voice services and data and internet services 
voice services consist of local voice services such as basic local exchange services  long distance voice services such as intralata long distance services and interlata long distance services and other voice services such as operator services  public telephone service  enhanced voice services and cpe 
voice services revenues are also generated on a wholesale basis from switched access service revenues  wholesale long distance service revenues included in long distance services revenues and wholesale access revenues included in local voice services revenues 
data and internet services includes data services such as traditional private lines  wholesale private lines  frame relay  atm and related cpe and internet services such as dsl  dia  vpn  internet dial access  web hosting  professional services and related cpe 
revenues from optical capacity transactions are also included in revenues from data services 
depending on the product or service purchased  a customer may pay an up front fee  a monthly fee  a usage charge or a combination of these 
our wireless services are provided through our wholly owned subsidiary  qwest wireless llc  which holds mhz licenses to provide personal communications service  or pcs  in most markets in our local service area 
we offer wireless services to residential and business customers  providing them the ability to use the same telephone number for their wireless phone as for their home or business phone 
in august  we entered into a services agreement with a subsidiary of sprint that allows us to resell sprint wireless services  including access to sprint s nationwide pcs wireless network  to consumer and business customers  primarily within our local service area 
we plan to begin offering these sprint services under our brand name in early our wireless customers who are currently being serviced through our proprietary wireless network will be transitioned at our cost onto sprint s network 
we are still evaluating both the operational effects of this new wholesale wireless arrangement and the financial effects  however  due to the anticipated decrease in usage of our own wireless network we anticipate that we will record a charge related to an additional impairment of our wireless network 
we expect that the impairment charge will be in the range of million to million 
we have not adjusted our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  for any potential impacts of this agreement 
other services revenue is predominately derived from subleases of some of our unused real estate assets  such as space in our office buildings  warehouses and other properties 
our wholly owned subsidiary  dex  previously published telephone directories in our local service area 
virtually all of dex s revenues were derived from the sale of advertising in its various directories 
during  we entered into an agreement to sell our entire directory publishing business to a third party for approximately billion 
the sale was divided into two phases  the first of which closed in november at this closing  we received approximately billion of gross proceeds 
the second phase closed in september at this closing  we received approximately billion of gross proceeds 
the results of operations from our directory publishing business for all periods presented are included in income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and  accordingly  the results of operations for all periods discussed below do not include the operating revenues or expenses of dex 
for more information regarding the sale of dex  see note assets held for sale including discontinued operations to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
business trends our results continue to be impacted by a number of factors influencing the telecommunications industry and our local service area 
first  the weak economy in our local service area has continued to impact demand from both our consumer and business customers 
the impacts include reduced demand for services resulting in loss of access lines  renegotiated commitments and loss of customers 
we believe demand will continue to be affected because the recovery in our local service area is expected to lag the national recovery 
second  technology substitution and competition is expected to continue to lead to access line loss 
however  the competitive landscape is changing as we have begun offering interlata services in our local service area and clecs are increasing their use of une p to gain a relative cost advantage for local voice services 
overall  as we expect industry wide competitive factors to continue to impact our results  we have developed new strategies for offering complementary services such as satellite television and wireless 
third  our results continue to be impacted by regulatory responses to the competitive landscape for both our local and long distance services 
wireline trends in general  we expect to see a continued decrease in wireline related revenues as a result of a decrease in demand for access lines 
access lines are expected to continue decreasing primarily because of technology substitution  including wireless and cable substitution for wireline telephony  and cable modem substitution for dial up internet access lines 
in addition  our competitors have accelerated their use of the une p platform to deliver wireline voice services 
although the use of une p did not have a material impact on our operations in  we believe the offering of une p services will cause downward pressure on our revenues and result in incremental retail access line losses 
we have experienced a decrease in wireline revenues associated with long distance voice services out of region  or outside of our local service area  due to competitive pressures and a shift in product mix 
increasingly  however  we expect long distance and dsl revenues within our local service region to offset these revenue declines 
we expect to see a continued decline in wholesale switched access revenues due primarily to pricing changes and volume declines 
pricing declines occurred due to state regulatory actions and the calls order 
the calls order capped prices for certain services  which resulted in a price decline for switched access services 
volumes fell in due to general declines in long distance usage 
we expect that switched access revenues will continue to decline as a result of more customers selecting qwest as their long distance provider and from competition from wireless and other wireline providers 
we have also begun to experience and expect increased competitive pressure from telecommunications providers either emerging from bankruptcy protection or reorganizing their capital structure to more effectively compete against us 
as a result of these increased competitive pressures  we have been and may continue to be forced to respond with less profitable product offerings and pricing plans that allow us to retain and attract customers 
these pressures could adversely affect our operating results and financial performance 
wireless trends although wireless revenues were similar in to  during we began to experience net subscriber losses due to our decision to de emphasize marketing of wireless services and changes to customer credit requirements  coupled with intense industry competition and the impact of the economic slowdown 
we expect these same factors to continue in  and expect that the continued loss of subscribers will cause wireless revenues to decline during starting in  we expect to expand our wireless offerings through our new arrangement with sprint 
this arrangement will enable us to utilize sprint s nationwide digital wireless network to offer our customers new voice and data capabilities 
merger with u s west on june   we merged with u s west  inc the discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the years  and reflects the transition that took place as a result of the merger 
at the time of the merger  we anticipated that the merger would essentially enable us to extend our broadband internet leadership position 
the merger was expected to allow us to reach more consumer and business customers through expanded broadband local connectivity and  in doing so  implement our strategy of becoming the premier end to end provider of advanced broadband internet based communications worldwide 
the merger was also expected to provide significant economies of scale and cost savings through the avoidance or elimination of duplicate operating costs and expenditures 
since the consummation of the merger  we have realized certain operating benefits  however  we have not achieved all of the benefits expected by management at the time of the merger primarily due to a decline in the economy and the resulting over capacity that occurred in the industry 
in addition  we experienced delays in our anticipated timing for obtaining approval to re enter the long distance business in our local service area which has delayed our ability to implement the overall strategy 
we accounted for the merger as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
for accounting purposes  u s west was deemed the accounting acquirer and its historical financial statements have been carried forward as those of the combined company 
in connection with the merger  each outstanding share of u s west common stock was converted into the right to receive shares of qwest common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares 
in addition  all outstanding u s west stock options and warrants were converted into options and warrants to acquire qwest common stock at the same ratio 
all share and per share amounts presented for have been restated to give retroactive effect to the exchange ratio 
we have restated the previously reported value of consideration in the merger  primarily because it had been based upon an improper valuation of the fair value of stock options and warrants 
following the restatement  the total value of the consideration was approximately billion as restated  which was allocated to the estimated fair values of our identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  including billion to goodwill 
for more information on the merger with u s west  including the restatements to the merger consideration and the allocation of purchase price  see note merger to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
presentation the results for and presented below are as restated 
please refer to note restatement of results to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the analysis is organized in a way that provides the information required  while highlighting the information that we believe will be instructive for understanding the relevant trends going forward 
in addition to the discussion of the historical information that reviews the current reporting presentation of our financial statements  an overview of the segment results is provided in segment results below 
the segment discussion below reflects the way we reported our segment results to our chief executive officer following a change in december unless otherwise indicated  all information is presented in accordance with gaap 
the merger significantly impacts the comparison of the results of operations between and the financial results of pre merger qwest for the first six months of are not included in the statements of the combined entity 
consequently  the results include a full twelve months of pre merger qwest s business  compared to six months in after the merger  we immediately began the process of integrating the two companies  including merging responsibilities 
consequently  we are unable to precisely separate the results of the two companies for any period after the merger and analyze the business results of each company in the context of the merger 
however  in order to analyze versus revenues and expenses  we estimated the impact of the merger by assuming that the revenues and expenses for the first six months of for pre merger qwest were equal to the first six months of excluding certain non recurring items certain optical capacity asset and equipment transactions 
while we believe these assumptions are appropriate under the circumstances  different assumptions could lead to different impacts to our analysis

voice services voice services revenues decreased billion  or  in and increased million  or  in voice services vs 
the voice services decrease in was the result of access line losses  our focus on more profitable products and services and a reduction in wholesale switched access revenues  each of which is discussed further below 
we experienced a decline in local voice services revenues of million in associated with the loss of  access lines 
the access line loss was driven by a soft economy in our local service area  technology substitution to wireless and broadband services and competition 
we are experiencing competition from both facility and non facility based providers such as cable companies providing telephony services  clecs  and other telecommunications providers reselling our services 
throughout the last half of and during  we evaluated the profitability of specific products sold outside of our local service area 
based upon this evaluation  we de emphasized and stopped promoting certain services including interlata long distance in the consumer and business markets  wholesale long distance  intralata long distance and operator services 
in addition  we also experienced lower long distance pricing due to competitive pressures and a shift in the product mix to certain wholesale services 
these factors combined to reduce long distance voice revenues by million in we also experienced a revenue decline of million in switched access revenues in the switched access revenue declines were due primarily to pricing and volume declines 
pricing declines occurred due to state regulatory actions and the july calls order 
the calls order capped prices for certain services  which resulted in a price decline for switched access services 
volumes also fell due to general declines in demand for long distance usage and competitive losses 
in addition to the revenue decreases described above  other voice services declined million in  primarily due to declines in demand for services such as collocation  public telephone services and directory assistance 
the declines were primarily driven by the soft telecommunications market  telecommunications company bankruptcies  wireless substitution of public telephones and deteriorating economic conditions 
voice services vs 
of the million increase in voice services revenues in approximately billion is attributable to the impact of the merger 
additionally  voice revenues decreased by million primarily as a result of access line losses 
we experienced revenue declines of million in switched access  million in business customer price reductions and million related to access line losses in the switched access revenue declines were primarily due to the same regulatory and industry effects described for above 
during and  we reduced our rates to business customers to remain competitive in the marketplace for advanced voice services 
in addition  business customers converted their single access lines to a fewer number of high speed  high capacity access lines allowing for the transport of multiple simultaneous telephone calls and transmission of data at higher rates of speed 
this conversion effectively resulted in the rate reduction and contributed to access line loss 
offsetting the revenue declines in was an increase of million in wholesale long distance revenue  which resulted from a shift in our emphasis from retail to wholesale long distance services 
partially offsetting the increases in out of region long distance revenue was a decrease in intralata long distance revenue in our local service area 
data and internet services data and internet services revenues remained relatively flat in and increased billion  or  in approximately million of the increase in is attributable to the merger 
additionally  data and internet services revenues increased by million in  primarily for reasons described below 
data and internet services vs 
in  revenue increases from ip products such as internet dial access  dsl and dia were offset by declines in data services such as wholesale private line 
during  internet dial access revenues increased million primarily from sales to large isps and businesses for use in their internal telecommunication networks 
dsl revenues increased by million due to the addition of approximately  dsl subscribers for a total of  subscribers at the end of due to higher customer demand 
dia revenues grew million in as demand for access to the internet increased from business and wholesale customers 
data revenue declined by million  primarily due to weak sales as a result of lower demand and disconnects of wholesale private line services by existing wholesale customers as the slow economy forced those customers to decrease the bandwidth they purchase to correlate with their current needs 
data and internet services vs 
in  data revenue increases were from products such as frame relay  atm  private line and cpe combined with internet products such as hosting  professional services  dsl and dia 
in  we experienced million revenue increase from business and wholesale private line services  frame relay and atm sales 
this reflected expanding customer telecommunications needs during and early in addition  sales of cpe to our business customers increased by million as a result of providing total telecommunications solutions to our customers 
dsl revenues increased by million in as a result of the addition of approximately  dsl subscribers 
in addition dia revenues grew million in as demand for access to the internet increased from business and wholesale customers 
wireless revenues from the wireless services segment increased by million  or  in and increased million  or  in wireless vs 
although net subscribers fell from million in  to million in  revenues increased slightly 
we did not experience an overall revenue decline due to the timing of the acquisition and disposition of customers between the years 
the fall in subscribers  despite an expanding overall market  reflects our decision to de emphasize sales of wireless services on a stand alone basis  tighten credit policies and limit product marketing  as well as the impact of intense industry competition  the economic slowdown  lack of a national network and higher than expected customer disconnects 
during  our wireless penetration percentage our wireless subscribers divided by the total number of subscribers in the points of presence we cover declined in the markets we serve from in to in wireless vs 
in  total wireless subscribers increased from  in to million in the increase in subscribers reflected the increase in demand for wireless services and our focus on growing the wireless subscriber base 
during  our wireless penetration percentage grew in the markets we serve from in to in other services other services revenue consists primarily of rental income from our owned and leased real estate 
other services revenue remained flat at million in and million in in  other revenues increased million or from million in  due to eliminating the need for internal administrative space and leasing it externally

facility costs are third party telecommunications expenses we incur to connect customers to our network or to end user product platforms not owned by us both in region and out of region 
network costs include third party expenses to repair and maintain the network and supplies to provide services to customers 
total cost of sales decreased million  or  in and increased billion  or  in during  our expenses declined due to improved management expense controls  lower staffing requirements and lower sales volumes offset by a decrease in the net pension credit 
of the billion increase in cost of sales in  approximately billion is attributable to the merger 
additionally  cost of sales increased billion in this was primarily the result of increased facility costs which is discussed below 
cost of sales  as a percentage of revenue  was for  for and in the increase in cost of sales as a percent of revenue between and was driven by the fact that the products and services of pre merger qwest were generally associated with lower gross margins than the u s west products and services 
facility costs  including leased local access circuits  decreased million  or  in  and increased billion  or  in the decrease in is attributable to cost savings associated with network optimization and reduced voice volumes partially offset by costs associated with the introduction of new product platforms 
network optimization savings are primarily derived from eliminating excess capacity from the network and migrating from lower speed services to more cost efficient higher speed services where applicable 
approximately billion of the increase in facilities costs in is attributable to the merger 
additionally  facilities costs increased million in due to the introduction of new product platforms  including our internet dial and hosting infrastructure  and increased long distance volumes in our out of region wholesale business 
our network costs declined million  or  in and increased million  or  in during  we reduced our reliance on third party contractors to provide network maintenance services  by shifting this work to our employees 
we also experienced lower costs associated with wireless handset sales as a result of lower unit prices and decreases in the number of new wireless subscribers 
approximately million of the increase is attributable to the merger 
additionally  network expense increased million  in  primarily due to higher total wireless handset costs as we expanded our wireless customer base during employee and service related costs  such as salaries and wages  benefits  commissions  and third party customer service were essentially flat in and decreased million  or  in in  increases in benefits  pension and taxes as a result of the reduction in the net pension credit  as discussed below in combined pension and post retirement benefits were offset by decreases in salaries and wages included in cost of sales  primarily due to lower staffing requirements  combined with a reduction in the use of third party contractors to design and install services for customers 
the merger caused an expense increase of approximately million in additionally  employee and service related costs decreased million in the decrease is attributable to lower bonus payments to management employees  overtime reductions and salaries and wage decreases due to lower staffing requirements 
non employee related costs  such as real estate costs  cost of sales for cpe  and reciprocal compensation payments  decreased million  or  in and increased million  or  in the decrease in is attributable to lower reciprocal compensation costs due to an april fcc order which limited the amount of reciprocal compensation due to isps  lower postage and shipping costs associated with improved management expense controls and lower cost of sales for data and ip cpe  associated with lower cpe revenue 
the merger had minimal impact on as it relates to non employee related costs 
additionally  non employee related costs increased approximately million in the increase is primarily attributable to higher access expense and external commissions

additionally  sg a increased million in due to increases in bad debt expense  employee expense and non employee cost increases partially offset by decreases in property and other taxes 
property and other taxes increased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in the increase in is attributable to capital expansion for both the traditional telephone network and global fiber optic broadband network that took place during the years ended december  and the merger caused an increase in property and other tax expense of approximately million 
also  property and other taxes decreased million in as a result of changes in property tax estimates 
bad debt expense decreased million  or  in and increased million  or  in bad debt expense decreased as a percentage of revenue from in to in the decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to improved collections practices and tighter credit policies offset by bankruptcies of wholesale customers and weak economic conditions 
approximately million of the increase in is attributable to the merger 
bad debt expense also increased million in as a result of the impact of the slow down of the economy 
employee and service related costs  such as salaries and wages  benefits  sales commissions  overtime  professional fees such as telemarketing and customer service costs  decreased million  or  in and increased million  or  in the decrease in was associated with lower salaries and wages  decreased professional fees  and reduced bonus payments to management employees 
the decrease in salaries and wages of million was primarily due to lower staffing requirements 
the decrease in professional fees of million was primarily due to lower costs associated with re entering the interlata long distance market  and payments to third party service providers  as we re incorporated certain previously outsourced customer service functions in the wireless services segment 
bonus payments to management employees also decreased by million from the prior year 
partially offsetting these declines were increased benefits  pension and taxes of million mainly as a result of the decrease in the net pension credit as discussed below in combined pension and post retirement benefits and increased legal and other professional fees due to various investigations and claims 
approximately million of the increase in is attributable to the merger 
additionally  employee and service related expenses increased million in the increase is primarily attributable to higher outside professional fees associated with re entering the interlata long distance market and higher commissions partially offset by various lower employee costs 
non employee related costs  such as marketing and advertising  rent for administrative space and software expenses  increased million  or  in and were essentially flat in the increase was driven by a shift in information technology resources to maintenance activities from those that were eligible for capitalization 
the increase was partially offset by postage and shipping  reduced customer care costs and lower marketing and advertising expenses 
the merger caused an expense increase of approximately million 
also  non employee related costs decreased million  in  due to lower access expense and external commissions 
combined pension and post retirement benefits our results include a pension credit  net of post retirement expenses  of million in million after tax or per diluted share  million in million after tax or per diluted share and million in million after tax or per diluted share 
absent these credits  our net loss in each of these years would have been higher by these amounts 
the net pension credit is a function of the amount of pension and post retirement benefits earned  interest on projected benefit obligations  amortization of costs and credits from prior benefit changes and the expected return on the assets held in the various plans 
for the reasons described below we expect that we will record a net expense of million related to pension and post retirement obligations in as opposed to a net pension credit 
the net pension credit is allocated partially to cost of sales and the remaining balance to sg a 
a reduction in the expected return on plan assets as well as a reduction in recognized actuarial gains  offset by lower service and interest costs  accounted for the decrease in the pension credit for the expected return on the plan assets component decreased million  or in because of a continued deterioration in the equity markets 
we expect that our pension credit will be lower than due to the volatile equity market conditions of through and the scheduled increase in pension benefits required under our union contracts 
we also expect our post retirement expenses to increase as a result of rising health care rates 
as a result  we expect that we will record a net expense in as opposed to a net credit 
you can find additional information on our pension and post retirement plans in note employee benefits to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
also  for a discussion of the accounting treatment and assumptions regarding pension and post retirement benefits  see the discussion of critical accounting policies below 
depreciation depreciation expense decreased million  or  in and increased billion  or  in the decrease in was primarily the result of the charge we recorded related to the impairment of our assets and the resulting decrease in the depreciable basis of our fixed assets as discussed below 
the impact of the impairment will reduce our annual depreciation expense by approximately million  effective july  the increase is the result of the acquisition of approximately billion of assets in connection with the merger  other capital expenditures in and  and the catch up in our depreciation discussed in the following two paragraphs 
during and  u s west agreed to sell approximately  access lines to third party telecommunications service providers  including approximately  access lines to citizens communications company citizens in nine states 
because these access lines were classified as held for sale  u s west discontinued recognizing depreciation expense on these assets and recorded them at the lower of their cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell 
on july   we terminated our agreement with citizens under which the majority of the remaining access lines in eight states were to have been sold and ceased actively marketing the remaining lines 
as a result  the remaining access lines in eight states were reclassified as being held for use as of june  the access lines were measured individually at the lower of their carrying value before they were classified as held for sale  adjusted for any depreciation expense or impairment losses that would have been recognized had the assets been continuously classified as held for use  or their estimated fair value at june  the required adjustments to the carrying value of the individual access lines were included in operating loss for this resulted in a charge to depreciation of million to catch up the depreciation on these access lines for the period they were held for sale 
goodwill and other intangibles amortization amortization expense decreased billion  or  in and increased million  or  in the decrease in was the result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets or sfas no 
 which required us to cease amortization of indefinite lived intangible assets effective january  and the recognition of an impairment charge on intangibles with finite lives 
the impact of the impairment will reduce our annual amortization expense by approximately million  effective july  the increase in amortization is the result of the goodwill generated from the merger and the result of the may  change in the amortizable life of a portion of goodwill from years to years 
goodwill impairment charges as discussed in greater detail below  under critical accounting policies  on january  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we reviewed our goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives for potential impairment based on the fair value of our entire enterprise using undiscounted cash flows 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill impairments be assessed based on allocating our goodwill to reporting units and comparing the net book value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below 
sfas no 
required us to perform a transitional impairment test on january  in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed a transitional impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives as of january  based on this analysis  we recorded a charge for the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
of billion on january  changes in market conditions  downward revisions to our projections of future operating results and other factors indicated that the carrying value of the remaining goodwill should be evaluated for impairment as of june  based on the results of that impairment analysis  we determined that the remaining goodwill balance of billion was completely impaired and we recorded an impairment charge on june  to write off the remaining balance 
asset impairment charges during  and  we recorded asset impairment charges of billion  million and million  respectively  detailed as follows year ended december  as restated as restated dollars in millions impairment of property  plant and equipment  facilities and other projects other real estate assets impairment due to merger special purpose access lines capitalized software due to restructuring activities capitalized software due to merger total asset impairments  effective june   pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets or sfas no 
 a general deterioration of the telecommunications market  downward revisions to our expected future results and other factors indicated that our investments in our long lived assets may have been impaired at that date 
in accordance with sfas no 
we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets using gross undiscounted cash flow projections 
for impairment analysis purposes  we grouped our property  plant and equipment and projected cash flows as follows traditional telephone network  national fiber optic broadband network  international fiber optic broadband network  wireless network  web hosting and application service provider asp  and certain assets held for sale 
based on the gross undiscounted cash flow projections  we determined that all of our asset groups  except our traditional telephone network  were impaired at june  for those asset groups that were impaired  we then estimated the fair value using a variety of techniques 
for the year ended december   we determined that the fair values were less than our carrying amounts by billion in the aggregate 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the fair value of the impaired assets becomes the new basis for accounting purposes 
as such  approximately billion in accumulated depreciation was eliminated in connection with the accounting for the impairments 
the impact of the impairments will reduce our annual depreciation and amortization expense by approximately billion  effective july  in  we recorded other asset impairment charges of million associated with the write down of other real estate assets that were held for sale 
as part of our restructuring activities in  we reviewed all of our existing construction projects 
following this review  we recorded asset impairment charges of million related to the abandonment of web hosting centers and other internal use construction projects 
subsequent to the merger  we reevaluated all of our assets for potential impairment and concluded that the fair value of some of our assets were below their carrying value 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge related to equipment and internal use construction projects of million and million in and  respectively  writing off the full carrying value of certain internal use construction projects and equipment 
also  in connection with the merger  we evaluated our dedicated special purpose access lines that we lease to clecs for potential impairment 
after considering the declining industry conditions and regulatory changes affecting clecs in  as well as the fact that these access lines had no alternative use and could not be sold or re deployed  we concluded that sufficient net cash flows would not be generated to recover the carrying value of these assets 
therefore  we concluded that the fair value of these assets was minimal and recorded an impairment charge of million in our consolidated statement of operations 
we recorded asset impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively related to internal software projects that we terminated  including customer database system projects 
following the merger  we reviewed all internal use software projects in process  and determined that certain projects should no longer be pursued 
because the projects were incomplete and abandoned  the fair value of such software was determined to be zero 
capitalized software costs of million and million were written off in and  respectively  and recorded to asset impairment charges on our consolidated statements of operations at the time they were abandoned 
the abandoned projects primarily included a significant billing system replacement 
restructuring and other charges during and  in order to streamline our business and consolidate operations in response to lower customer demand resulting from a decline in economic conditions  we implemented plans to reduce the number of employees  consolidate and sublease facilities  abandon certain capital projects and terminate certain operating leases

these activities included charges of million for severance benefits and employee related matters pursuant to established severance policies triggered by a reduction in employees  which we recorded directly to restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statement of operations 
we identified approximately  employees from various functional areas to be separated from the company as part of the staffing reduction 
the affected employees are entitled to receive severance benefits pursuant to established severance policies 
as of december   approximately  of the plan reductions were accomplished resulting in the utilization of million for cash payments and enhanced pension benefits 
we expect the remaining employee reductions  cash payments and provision of benefits to be completed by december  these charges were offset by a reversal of million of accruals established in as part of the restructuring plan as discussed below 
in conjunction with the staffing reductions  we permanently abandoned real estate facilities and recorded a charge of million related to the rental payments due under the leases  net of estimated subleases rentals  and estimates of amounts to terminate the leases 
offsetting the million charge was a reversal of million of accruals established in as part of the restructuring plan discussed below

we expect that the remaining reserve will be utilized over the remaining term of the leases which are up to five years 
in  we recorded an additional million charge primarily to increase the estimated cost of exiting our web hosting facilities net of a million expected sublease loss recorded in activities during the fourth quarter of  a plan was approved to further reduce current employee levels  consolidate and sublease facilities and abandon certain capital projects and terminate certain operating leases 
as a result  we recorded a restructuring charge of million to cover the costs associated with these actions as more fully described below 
in order to streamline our business and consolidate operations to meet lower customer demand resulting from a decline in economic conditions  we identified  employees  in various functional areas  to be terminated and accrued restructuring charges of million for severance benefits to be made to those employees 
as of december   our restructuring activities under this plan were substantially complete 
we terminated approximately  employees and made payments of million in cash severance  enhanced pension benefits and employee related payments 
as a result of the shortfall in actual terminations we reversed million of the accruals established in  which we recorded as a reduction in restructuring charges in our consolidated statement of operations 
due to the reduction in employees and the consolidation of operations  we recognized a restructuring charge to our consolidated statement of operations in of million for costs associated with the expected termination of operating lease agreements across the country 
by december  we had made payments of million associated with sublease losses and contract termination costs related to exiting these buildings 
a number of the operating lease agreements were subsequently terminated and as a result of certain favorable negotiations we reversed million of this reserve in we operated web hosting centers across the country that were subject to various operating leases 
we also had several web hosting centers under construction that would require additional capital outlays before they were functional 
additionally  we had some web hosting facilities under lease where no construction work had begun 
as a result of the slowing economy and the excess capacity at the time for web hosting  we suspended our plans to build web hosting centers where construction had not begun and halted further construction on those facilities under construction at the time 
we identified web hosting centers that would be permanently abandoned 
we expected to sublease the majority of the non operational web hosting centers at rates less than our lease rates for the facilities 
as a result we recorded a charge of million for expected sublease losses to our consolidated statement of operations in in  we exercised our options under the synthetic lease facility through which the web hosting centers were financed and purchased the buildings 
we paid million to acquire the buildings pursuant to these options 
we assessed the fair value of the buildings based on other comparable market activity and determined the guaranteed residual value under the synthetic lease facilities exceeded the fair value by million 
consequently  we recorded a charge of million in as mentioned above primarily to increase the estimated costs of exiting these facilities  net of a million expected sublease loss recorded in we also recorded a credit of million in directly to restructuring charges in our consolidated statements of operations related to deferred rent as a result of exiting the leased facilities described above

a breakdown of these costs is as follows year ended december  as restated dollars in millions contractual settlements and legal contingencies  net severance and employee related charges  net other merger related charges  net total merger related credits charges  net  we recorded charges to our consolidated statement of operations of million and million for and  respectively  associated with various contractual settlements and legal contingencies 
the charges were accrued to cancel various commitments no longer deemed necessary as a result of the merger and to settle various claims related to the merger 
in and  we reversed million and million  respectively  in our consolidated statement of operations 
the reversals resulted from favorable developments in the matters underlying contractual settlements and legal contingencies 
in connection with the merger  we reduced employee and contractor levels by over  people 
these employees were terminated prior to december  the and severance and employee related charges of million and million  respectively  consist of costs associated with payments to employees who involuntarily left the business since the consummation of the merger and  for  million in bonus payments that were subject to the successful completion of the merger 
upon the completion of our plans and achieving the planned reduction of  people in we reversed million of the severances and employee related reserves established that were no longer necessary 
other net merger related charges of million and million were incurred in and  respectively for professional fees  re branding costs and other incremental costs directly related to the merger 
we considered only those costs that were incremental and directly related to the merger to be merger related

interest expense also increased due to borrowings from our billion syndicated credit facility in the first quarter of to fund the repayment of approximately billion of outstanding commercial paper  which had a weighted average interest rate of as of december   compared to the weighted average interest rate as of december  on the credit facility 
additionally  interest expense in increased as a result of our directory publishing business borrowing million in august at a weighted average interest rate of as of december  finally  capitalized interest decreased million as a result of lower capital expenditures

accordingly  an impairment loss of billion was recorded in june to write the carrying amount of our investment down to its estimated fair value 
as discussed in note restatement of results to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  we re evaluated our valuation of kpnqwest as of december  that evaluation indicated that the fair value of our investment in kpnqwest was approximately billion at that date 
consequently  in our restated consolidated financial statements for  we have recorded an additional impairment loss of million in the fourth quarter of to reflect this change 
as a result of the continued decline in the fair value of kpnqwest subsequent to december   we recorded a further impairment to our investment for an other than temporary decline in value in the first quarter of in may  kpnqwest filed for bankruptcy protection and ceased operations 
we do not expect to recover any of our investment in kpnqwest and  as a result  in the second quarter of  we wrote off our remaining investment in kpnqwest 
the losses and impairment charges in our consolidated statement of operations related to our investment in kpnqwest includes our equity share of losses in kpnqwest 
loss on global crossing equity securities and related derivatives 
in december  we sold approximately million shares of the million shares we held in global crossing common stock 
in connection with that sale  we entered into derivative contracts to create equity return swaps 
our objective in entering into these equity return swaps was to synthetically replace the million shares sold 
as a result  we maintained some of the risk and rewards of investment ownership and received cash proceeds upon the sale of the shares 
these derivatives were carried at market value with changes in market value included in other income 
due to a decline in the market value of the derivatives  we recorded charges of million and million for and  respectively

we review our portfolio of equity securities on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in value on individual securities are other than temporary

we recorded write downs of our investments for other than temporary declines of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

we received valid tender offers of approximately billion in total principal amount of the qcf notes and issued in exchange approximately billion in face value of new debt securities of qsc 
the majority of these debt exchanges were accounted for as debt extinguishments resulting in the recognition of a billion gain recorded in other expense income in the consolidated statement of operations in item of this report 
the cash flows for two of the new debt securities were not considered substantially different than the exchanged debt and therefore no gain was realized upon exchange 
for these two debt instruments  the difference between the fair value of the new debt and the carrying amount of the exchanged debt of approximately million is being amortized as a credit to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the new debt 
during the first quarter of  we exchanged through private exchange transactions  million in face amount of debt that was issued by qcf

the valuation allowance is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas no 
which requires an assessment of evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
our losses in recent periods coupled with the second quarter asset impairments constituted sufficient evidence to require a valuation allowance under sfas no 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient evidence exists to support realization of the federal and state deferred tax assets 
the decrease in the effective income tax benefit rate as compared to was predominately related to the write down of our investment in kpnqwest  which is non deductible for tax purposes 
income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations net of tax income from discontinued operations increased billion  or in and million  or in income from discontinued operations in all years predominately relates to our directory publishing business  dex

segment results sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements of public business enterprises and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim and annual financial reports issued to shareholders 
operating segments are components of an enterprise that engage in business activities from which revenues may be earned and expenses may be incurred  and for which discrete financial information is available and regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker codm of an enterprise 
in december  our codm  changed the way he views the results of our operations  therefore  we changed our segment reporting effective december to reflect the manner in which we managed the business 
the codm of a business represents the highest level of management who is responsible for the overall allocation of resources within the business 
our codm is our chief executive officer 
set forth below is revenue and operating expense information for the years ended december   and for the three segments utilized at the end of wireline  wireless  and other services 
the wireline segment includes businesses that were previously in both u s west and pre merger qwest  and the wireless business was only in u s west 
the operating segments reflect strategic business units that offer similar products and services 
management evaluates the performance of each segment and allocates capital resources based on segment income as defined below 
our results of operations applicable to our directory publishing business are included in income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations in item of this report 
prior to december  we managed our operations primarily from the perspective of the customer groups that used our networks such as consumer  business  and wholesale  except for wireless and directory publishing  which we managed as separate operating segments based on the similarity of products and services 
our view as of december allowed us to better align network infrastructure costs with our revenue segments and manage those costs more effectively 
network infrastructure costs include all engineering expense  design  repair and maintenance costs and all third party facilities costs 
segment income consists of each segment s revenues and direct expenses 
segment revenues are based on the types of products and services offered as described in results of operations above 
the network infrastructure is designed to be scalable and flexible to handle multiple products and services 
as a result  we do not allocate network infrastructure costs to individual products 
consequently  product margin impacts of certain revenue increases or decreases are not provided within our discussion of the results 
direct administrative costs include customer support  collections and marketing 
indirect administrative costs such as finance  information technology  real estate and legal are included in the other services segment 
we manage indirect administrative services costs centrally  consequently  the costs are not allocated to the wireline or wireless services segments 
similarly  we manage depreciation  amortization  interest expense  interest income  and other income expense on a total company basis 
as a result  these charges are not allocated to either the wireline or wireless segments 
since all expenses have not been allocated to the segments  we have disclosed segment expenses without distinguishing between cost of sales and sg a

we owe reciprocal compensation payments to other telecommunications carriers when the balance of local traffic from our customers exceeds traffic from another telecommunications company s customers

to preserve capital and maintain liquidity  we invest with financial institutions deemed to be of sound financial condition and in high quality and relatively risk free investment products 
our cash investment policy limits the concentration of investments with specific financial institutions or among certain products and includes criteria related to credit worthiness of any particular investment 
we have recently taken the following measures to improve our near term liquidity and our capital structure and generally reduce financial risk amended and restated our credit facility defined below in order to a lengthen the maturity  b obtain more flexible covenants  and c achieve a more favorable amortization schedule  sold the dex directory publishing business  which generated gross cash proceeds of billion  reduced capital investment and continued to manage working capital  and refinanced qwest corporation qc debt due in with debt that has maturities in and even if we are successful in our de leveraging efforts  we may need to obtain additional financing to meet our debt service obligations if operations do not improve  if revenue and operating cash flow declines are worse than expected  if economic conditions do not improve or if we become subject to significant judgments and or settlements in connection with the resolution of one or more matters described under securities actions and derivative action in item of this report

cash used provided by financing activities was million in  billion in and billion in as of december   we had no unused credit capacity available to us under our existing credit facility  however  based on our recent access to certain capital markets and our relationships with the lead banks in our credit facilities  we believe we have the ability to secure additional borrowings 
at december  we were in compliance with all provisions or covenants of our borrowings 
under the qsc credit facility described below  we have obtained a waiver for non compliance to provide certain annual and quarterly financial information to the lenders 
the waiver extended the compliance date to provide annual financial information for to november  and first and second quarter financial information for to december  for additional information regarding the covenants of our existing debt instruments  see note borrowings to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
financing activities until february  we maintained commercial paper programs to finance our short term operating cash needs 
we had a billion syndicated credit facility the credit facility available to support our commercial paper program 
as a result of reduced demand for our commercial paper  in february we borrowed the full amount under the credit facility and used the proceeds to repay billion  constituting all of the commercial paper outstanding and terminated our commercial paper program 
the remainder of the proceeds was used to pay maturities and capital lease obligations and to fund operations 
in march  we amended the credit facility and converted the billion balance into a one year term loan due may  with billion designated to qwest capital funding  inc qcf and billion designated to qc 
qc used approximately million of the proceeds from its march bond offering discussed below to reduce the total amount outstanding under the credit facility 
following this repayment  the credit facility had billion outstanding as of march   all of which was allocated to qcf 
also in march  qc issued billion in bonds with a ten year maturity and an interest rate 
at december   the interest rate was 
once we have registered the notes  the interest rate will return to  the original stated rate 
the proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used to repay million on the credit facility  short term obligations and currently maturing long term borrowings 
during the first quarter of  we exchanged  through private transactions  million in face amount of debt issued by qcf 
in exchange for the debt  we issued approximately million shares of our treasury stock with a fair value of million 
the trading prices for our shares at the time the exchange transactions were consummated ranged from per share to per share 
in august  we amended the credit facility a second time 
in connection with the second amendment  we reconstituted the credit facility as a revolving credit facility with qsc as the primary borrower the qsc credit facility and extended the term of the qsc credit facility to may many of our loan documents  including the qsc credit facility  contain financial reporting covenants that require delivery of annual and quarterly periodic reports  and the failure to comply with these financial reporting covenants can result in a default under certain of our loan documents 
we have obtained extensions under the qsc credit facility for the delivery of our first and second quarter financial information for to december  in august  dex borrowed million under a term loan agreement dex term loan due september to fund costs in connection with the construction  installation  acquisition and improvement of telecommunications assets 
we classified this term loan as a current liability based upon the requirement to pay this debt in full upon the sale of the dex west business  which closed in september see note assets held for sale including discontinued operations to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  for further discussion of the terms of the dex sale 
as discussed below  on august   we paid off the outstanding balance of million of the dex term loan 
on november   we completed the sale of the dex east business 
the gross proceeds from the sale of the dex east business were approximately billion and were paid in cash 
we used approximately billion of the cash proceeds we received from the sale of the dex east business to reduce our obligations under the qsc credit facility to billion  and we expect to use the balance to invest in telecommunications assets and to redeem certain other indebtedness 
on november   we announced an offer to exchange up to billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of qcf for new debt securities of qsc and qwest 
as of the completion of the offer on december   approximately billion in total principal amount of the qcf notes were validly tendered and accepted for exchange for approximately billion of new debt securities of qsc 
the new qsc notes consist of notes due  notes due and notes due pursuant to an indenture issued on december  we paid no dividends in financing activities in january  we repurchased million shares of our common stock from bellsouth corporation bellsouth for billion in cash 
as part of this transaction  we entered into an agreement with bellsouth in january under which bellsouth agreed to purchase services valued at million from us over a five year period the agreement 
the agreement provided that bellsouth could make payments for the services in our common stock based upon values as specified in the agreement 
during the first quarter of  we received approximately  shares of our common stock valued at million from bellsouth in partial satisfaction of the million accounts receivable outstanding at december  in addition  in accordance with the agreement  we used million of the million in cash received from certain bellsouth affiliates to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
the fair value of the stock tendered in the first quarter of of million was recorded in treasury stock 
the million difference between i the fair value of the shares and ii the value assigned to the shares in the agreement of million was recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital 
for more information concerning transactions with bellsouth  see note stockholders equity to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
in february  qcf issued a total of billion in notes which consisted of billion in notes due with an interest rate of and billion in notes due with an interest rate of 
the net proceeds from the notes were used to repay outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes 
in march  we completed a cash tender to buy back certain outstanding debt 
in the tender offer  we repurchased approximately million in principal of outstanding debt 
as a result of the repurchase  we incurred million in premium payments and recorded this expense in gain loss on early retirement of debt in our consolidated statement of operations 
the tender offer was undertaken to retire the bonds because of their high coupon rates and to reduce interest costs 
in connection with this tender offer  the indentures were amended to eliminate restrictive covenants and certain default provisions 
in july  qcf issued a total of billion in notes which consisted of billion in notes due with an interest rate of  billion in notes due with an interest rate of  and million in notes due with an interest rate of 
the net proceeds from the notes were used to repay outstanding commercial paper and maturing debt 
on may   our board of directors approved a dividend of per share on our common stock which was paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on june  in satisfaction of any prior statement by us in connection with or following the merger regarding the payment or declaration of dividends 
as a result  dividends of million were paid on common stock in compared to million in financing activities in june  qc issued billion in notes with a three year maturity due and an interest rate of 
the net proceeds from the notes were used to repay outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes 
in august  qcf issued a total of billion in notes which consisted of billion in notes due with an interest rate of and billion in notes due with an interest rate of 
the net proceeds from the notes were used to repay outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes 
we paid dividends of million in payment obligations and contingencies payment obligations 
the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period total year year year year year after years dollars in millions future contractual cash obligations long term debt      capital lease obligations operating leases   purchase commitment obligations telecommunications commitments   iru operating and maintenance obligations  advertising and promotion total future contractual cash obligations    we have future purchase commitments with clecs  ixcs and third party vendors that require us to make payments to purchase network services  capacity and telecommunications equipment primarily through december  these commitments require us to maintain minimum monthly and or annual billings  in certain cases based on usage 
we believe we will meet substantially all minimum payment commitments 
in the unlikely event that requirements are not met  we will record the appropriate charges 
also included in the telecommunications commitments are unconditional purchase obligations that we entered into with certain telecommunications services companies  including kmc and calpoint  in connection with sales of equipment to those entities at the time we entered into facilities management service agreements with them 
in connection with the kmc and calpoint arrangements  we also agreed to pay the monthly service fees directly to trustees that serve as paying agents on debt instruments issued by special purpose entities sponsored by kmc and calpoint 
these unconditional purchase obligations require us to pay at least of the monthly service fees for the entire term of the agreements  regardless of whether kmc or calpoint provide us services 
our remaining unconditional purchase obligations under these agreements were billion at december  as part of our internal analysis  we have identified additional telecommunications commitments that were not included in quantification of our telecommunications commitments previously reported by us 
also  we determined that the amounts previously reported for kmc and calpoint only included the unconditional purchase obligation but did not include the additional monthly commitment beyond that 
costs for these additional monthly commitments were appropriately included as cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations or capital expenditures in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
a portion of our fiber optic broadband network consists of facilities that were purchased or are leased from third parties 
these agreements are generally to years in length 
at the time of entering into these agreements we generally incur the obligation to pay operating and maintenance fees to a third party for the term of the agreement 
concurrent with the closing of the sale of the dex east business  we also entered into an advertising and telecommunications purchase commitment with the buyer 
pursuant to that commitment  we agreed to purchase from the buyer at least million of advertising per year for years which commitment was not increased after the sale of the dex west business and the buyer agreed to exclusively purchase from us those telecommunication services that it uses from time to time during this same period  subject to availability from us 
in addition  we have various long term  non cancelable future purchase commitments for advertising and promotion services  including advertising with online service providers as well as marketing at sports arenas  stadiums and other venues and events through letters of credit and guarantees 
at december   we had letters of credit of approximately million and guarantees of approximately million 
contingencies 
we are a defendant in a number of legal actions and the subject of a number of investigations by federal and state agencies 
certain of these actions present significant risk to us 
we are unable at this time to estimate reasonably a range of loss that we would incur if the plaintiffs in one or more of these lawsuits were to prevail 
while we intend to defend against these matters vigorously  the ultimate outcomes of these cases are very uncertain  and we can give no assurance as to the impacts on our financial results or financial condition as a result of these matters 
any settlement of or judgment on one or more of these claims could be material  and we cannot assure you that we would have resources available to pay such judgments 
also  our ability to meet our debt service obligations and our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
for a description of these legal actions  please see note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
credit ratings our credit ratings were lowered by moody s investor services moody s  standard and poor s s p and fitch ratings fitch on multiple occasions during the table below summarizes our ratings for the years ended december  and december  december  moody s s p fitch moody s s p fitch corporate rating na b na na bbb na qwest corporation ba b b a bbb a qwest services corporation nr ccc nr na na na qwest communications corporation caa ccc ccc baa bbb bbb qwest capital funding  inc caa ccc ccc baa bbb bbb qwest communications international inc caa ccc ccc baa bbb bbb na not applicable nr not rated the december  ratings are still in effect and represent ratings of long term debt and loans at each entity 
with respect to moody s  a ba rating is judged to have speculative elements  meaning that the future of the issuer cannot be considered to be well assured 
often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate  and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times 
issuers with caa ratings are in poor standing with moody s 
these issuers may be in default  according to moody s  or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal and interest 
the  modifiers show relative standing within the major categories  being the highest  or best  modifier in terms of credit quality 
with respect to s p  any rating below bbb indicates that the security is speculative in nature 
a b rating indicates that the issuer currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation  but adverse business  financial or economic conditions will likely impair the issuers capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
a ccc indicates that the obligation is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and the issuer is dependent on favorable business  financial and economic conditions in order to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
the plus and minus symbols show relative standing within the major categories 
with respect to fitch  any rating below bbb is considered speculative in nature 
a b rating is considered highly speculative  meaning that significant credit risk is present  but a limited margin of safety remains 
financial commitments are currently being met  however  capacity for continued payment is contingent upon a sustained  favorable business and economic environment 
a ccc rating indicates default is a real possibility 
capacity for meeting financial commitments is solely reliant upon sustained  favorable business or economic developments 
the plus and minus symbols show relative standing within major categories 
debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agency s opinion of the ability of the issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due 
in general  lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs and or impaired ability to borrow 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell  or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
given our current credit ratings  as noted above  our ability to raise additional capital under acceptable terms and conditions may be negatively impacted 
other liquidity and capital resource considerations prior to  we entered into structured finance transactions under which we agreed to lease from unrelated parties certain real estate properties  including corporate offices  network operations centers and web hosting centers 
these were referred to as synthetic lease facilities 
these leases had terms of six years and were accounted for as operating leases 
in march  we paid the full amount necessary to acquire all properties subject to the synthetic lease agreements and unwound these agreements 
the purchase price of all such properties was million 
as a result of the purchase  the loan commitments totaling million were terminated and we are no longer liable for our residual value guarantees of up to million that were only applicable if the leases expired at the end of their term 
recent developments impacting liquidity and capital resources the following describes developments impacting our liquidity and capital resources from january  through the date of the filing of this report 
subsequent to year end  through september  we exchanged  through direct transactions  million face amount of debt issued by qcf 
in exchange for the debt  we issued million shares of common stock out of treasury and million of new qsc notes similar to the notes issued in december the trading prices for our shares at the time the exchange transactions were consummated ranged from per share to per share 
on june   qc entered into a senior term loan with two tranches for a total of billion principal amount of indebtedness 
the term loan consists of a billion floating rate tranche  due in  and a million fixed rate tranche  due in the term loan is unsecured and ranks equally with all of qc s current indebtedness 
the floating rate tranche is non prepayable for two years and thereafter is subject to prepayment premiums through there are no mandatory prepayment requirements 
the covenant and default terms are substantially the same as the other senior qc indebtedness 
the net proceeds were used to refinance qc debt due in and fund or refinance qc s investment in telecommunications assets 
the floating rate tranche bears interest at libor plus with a minimum interest rate of and the fixed rate tranche bears interest at per annum 
the lenders funded the entire principal amount of the loan subject to the original issue discount for the floating rate tranche of and for the fixed rate tranche of 
also  in connection with this qc issuance  we reduced our obligation under the qsc credit facility by million to a balance of billion 
on august   we used cash to payoff the outstanding balance of million of the dex term loan in full 
on september   we completed the sale of the dex west business 
the gross proceeds from the sale of the dex west business were approximately billion and were received in cash 
we used approximately million of the cash proceeds to reduce our obligation under the qsc credit facility to billion  and we expect to use the balance to invest in telecommunications assets and or to redeem other indebtedness 
as a result of the above transactions and year to date maturities  at september   our future maturities of long term borrowings are as follows maturities interest rates thereafter dollars in millions up to  above to  above to   above to  above to  above to above to  total     in september  we restructured our arrangements with calpoint and another vendor that effectively eliminated our services agreements and settled certain claims of the parties 
we paid million to restructure these arrangements but will continue to make payments to a trustee related to the calpoint agreement for of the unconditional purchase obligation 
this obligation will be paid to the trustee ratably through in connection with these transactions  our third quarter consolidated financial statements will reflect a liability of million and a pretax charge of million 
in addition  we expect to realize a cash savings of approximately million in as a result of these restructurings and additional cash savings through critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
these policies are considered critical because they have the potential to have a material impact on our financial statements  and because they require significant judgments and estimates 
certain historical accounting policies that were critical have been corrected and clarified in connection with our restatement 
these include revenue recognition applicable to our iru transactions  revenue and cost recognition related to our directory publishing business and other matters 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and related reserves revenues from services are recognized when the services are provided 
payments received in advance are deferred until the service is provided 
up front fees received  primarily activation fees and installation charges  as well as the associated customer acquisition costs  are deferred and recognized over the expected customer relationship  generally two to ten years 
expected customer relationship periods are estimated using historical data of actual customer retention patterns 
termination fees or other fees on existing contracts that are negotiated in conjunction with new contracts are deferred and recognized over the new contract term 
as the telecommunications market experiences greater competition and customers shift from traditional land based telephony services to mobile services  our estimated customer relationship periods will likely decrease 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to the recognition of revenue and establishment of reserves for uncollectible amounts in the results of operations is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management to make assumptions about future collections  billing adjustments and unauthorized usage  and the impact of changes in actual performance versus these estimates on the accounts receivable balance reported on our consolidated balance sheets and the results reported in our consolidated statements of operations could be material 
in selecting these assumptions  we use historical trending of write offs  industry norms  regulatory decisions and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts 
software capitalization policy internally used software  whether purchased or developed  is capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of months to five years 
in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  we capitalize certain costs associated with internally developed software such as payroll costs of employees devoting time to the projects and external direct costs for materials and services 
costs associated with internally developed software to be used internally are expensed until the point at which the project has reached the development stage 
subsequent additions  modifications or upgrades to internal use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform 
software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
the capitalization of software requires judgment in determining when a project has reached the development stage and the period over which we expect to benefit from the use of that software 
further  the recovery of software projects is periodically reviewed and may result in significant write offs 
pension and post retirement benefits pension and post retirement health care and life insurance benefits earned by employees during the year as well as interest on projected benefit obligations are accrued currently 
prior service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are amortized over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 
pension and post retirement costs are recognized over the period in which the employee renders service and becomes eligible to receive benefits as determined using the projected unit credit method 
in computing the pension and post retirement benefit costs  we must make numerous assumptions about such things as employee mortality and turnover  expected salary and wage increases  discount rates  expected return on plan assets and expected future cost increases 
two of these items generally have the most significant impact on the level of cost discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets 
annually  we set our discount rate primarily based upon the yields on high quality fixed income investments available at the measurement date and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
in making this determination we consider  among other things  the yields on moody s aa corporate bonds as of year end 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is the long term rate of return we expect to earn on the trust s assets 
we establish the expected rate of return by reviewing the investment composition of our plan assets  obtaining advice from our actuaries  reviewing historical earnings on the trust assets and evaluating current and expected market conditions 
to compute the expected return on pension plan assets  we apply our expected rate of return to the market related value of the plan assets 
the market related asset value is a computed value that recognizes changes in fair value of pension plan assets over a period of time  not to exceed five years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  we elected to recognize actual returns on our pension plan assets ratably over a five year period when computing our market related value of pension plan assets 
the election was made in when sfas no 
became effective 
this method has the effect of smoothing market volatility that may be experienced from year to year 
as a result  our expected return is not significantly impacted by the actual return on pension plan assets experienced in the current year 
changes in any of the assumptions we made in computing the net of the pension credit and post retirement benefit cost could have an impact on various components that comprise these expenses 
factors to be considered include the strength or weakness of the investment markets  changes in the composition of the employee base  fluctuations in interest rates  significant employee hirings or downsizings and medical cost trends 
changes in any of these factors could impact cost of sales and sg a on the consolidated statement of operations as well as the value of the asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
if our assumed expected rate of return of was basis points lower  the impact would have been to decrease the pension credit  net of post retirement expenses  by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
investments we review our equity investments on a quarterly basis to determine whether a decline in value on individual securities is other than temporary 
many factors are considered in assessing whether a decline in value is other than temporary  including  as may be appropriate earnings trends and asset quality  near term prospects and financial condition of the issuer  financial condition and prospects of the issuer s region and industry  the cause and severity of the decline in market price  analysts recommendations and stock price projections  the length of time generally six to nine months that fair value has been less than the carrying value  stock price volatility and near term potential for recovery  and our intent and ability to retain the investment 
if we conclude that the decline in value of an equity investment is other than temporary  we record a charge to our consolidated statements of operations to reduce the carrying value of the security to its estimated fair value 
changes in market conditions and our assessment of those conditions may impact the fair value of the investments on the consolidated balance sheet as well as charges to the consolidated statement of operations 
if we fail to recognize the factors as listed above in a timely manner  we could record losses on investments in the wrong period 
goodwill and other intangible assets we adopted sfas no 
in january sfas no 
requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
instead  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be reviewed for impairment upon adoption on january  and at least annually thereafter 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we performed our initial impairment analysis of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  the implementation involved the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  where a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below 
we determined the fair value of each significant reporting unit based on discounted forecasts of future cash flows 
judgments and assumptions are required in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and capital expenditures 
two of the most significant assumptions underlying the determination of the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets upon our initial implementation were the cash flow forecasts and discount rates used 
in connection with the measurement we performed at the date we adopted sfas no 
january   we have determined that a increase in the cash flow forecasts would have decreased the transitional impairment charge by approximately billion  resulting in a transitional impairment charge of approximately billion instead of billion 
in contrast  a decrease in the cash flow forecasts would have increased the transitional impairment charge by approximately billion  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately billion 
a basis point increase in the discount rate we used would have resulted in a transitional impairment charge of approximately billion instead of billion  while a basis point decrease in the discount rate would have resulted in a transitional impairment charge of approximately billion 
subsequent to adoption on january  of sfas no 
 we determined that circumstances indicated that it was more likely than not that an impairment loss was incurred  and as a result  we tested the remaining goodwill for possible impairment 
our impairment analysis as of june   resulted in an impairment of the remaining goodwill of approximately billion 
as a result of recording the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for the transitional impairment of billion and the additional impairment of billion  there is no goodwill remaining on our balance sheet as of and subsequent to june  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value estimates used in our june  measurement would have had no impact on the impairment recorded 
impairment of long lived assets effective june   pursuant to sfas no 
 the general deterioration of the telecommunications market  the downward revisions to our expected future results of operations and other factors indicated that our investments in long lived assets may have been impaired at that date 
in accordance with sfas no 
we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets using gross undiscounted cash flow projections 
for impairment analysis purposes  we grouped our property  plant and equipment and projected cash flows as follows traditional telephone network  national fiber optic broadband network  international fiber optic broadband network  wireless network  web hosting and asp  assets held for sale  and out of region dsl 
based on this assessment of recoverability  we concluded that our traditional telephone network was not impaired 
however  this analysis revealed that the remaining asset groups were impaired 
we then estimated the fair value of these asset groups and  as a result  we recorded a total of billion in asset impairment charges during the year ended december  as more fully described below 
following is a summary of impairment charges recognized by asset group for the year ended december  net of million for certain web hosting centers that have been reclassified to income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations in item of this report 
asset group impairment charge fair value methodology dollars in millions national fiber optic broadband network  discounted cash flows international fiber optic broadband network comparable market data wireless network comparable market data and discounted cash flows web hosting and asp assets comparable market data assets held for sale comparable market data out of region dsl discounted cash flows total impairment charges  the national fiber optic broadband network national network provides long distance voice services  data and internet services  and wholesale services to business  consumer and wholesale customers outside of our local service area 
the international fiber optic broadband network international network provides the same services to the same types of customers only outside of the united states 
the wireless network provides personal communications service  or pcs  in select markets in our local service area 
our web hosting and asp asset group provides business customers both shared and dedicated hosting on our servers as well as application hosting services to help design and manage the customer s website and their hosting applications 
assets held for sale primarily consist of excess network supplies 
our out of region dsl assets provide dsl service to customers outside our local service area 
calculating the estimated fair value of the asset groups as listed above involves significant judgments and a variety of assumptions 
for calculating fair value based on discounted cash flows  we forecasted future operating results and future cash flows  which included long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and capital expenditures 
we also used a discount rate based on an estimate of the weighted average cost of capital for the specific asset groups as of june  comparable market data was obtained by reviewing recent sales of similar asset types in third party market transactions 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the estimated future cash flows of would have changed the impairment charge by approximately million 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the discount rate used of basis points would have changed the impairment charge by approximately million 
restructuring reserves periodically  we commit to exit certain business activities  eliminate office or facility locations and or reduce our number of employees 
the charge to record such a decision depends upon various assumptions  including future severance costs  sublease income or disposal costs  length of time on market for abandoned rented facilities  contractual termination costs and so forth 
such estimates are inherently judgmental and may change based upon actual experience 
the number of employees and the related estimate of severance costs for employees combined with the estimate of future losses on sublease income and disposal activity generally has the most significant impact 
due to the estimates and judgments involved in the application of each of these accounting policies  changes in our plans and these estimates and market conditions could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements and cumulative effect of adoption in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for intangible assets excluding goodwill acquired individually or with a group of other assets at the time of their acquisition 
it also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
as required  we adopted sfas no 
effective january  upon adoption of sfas no 
 the fair value of goodwill was evaluated as of january  as if an acquisition of each of our reporting units at fair value had occurred on that date 
the valuation was based on our reporting units at that date  as opposed to an enterprise wide basis  as was the case under the prior accounting literature 
the cumulative effect of adoption of sfas no 
was a loss from a change in accounting principle of approximately billion 
the adoption of sfas no 
reduced our amortization expense for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets by approximately billion annually  beginning january  the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was reflected as a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill as of january  see note goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further information 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
this pronouncement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
under sfas no 
 long lived assets being held or used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable from their expected future undiscounted cash flows a triggering event 
the impairment loss is equal to the difference between the asset s carrying amount and estimated fair value 
in addition  sfas no 
requires long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale for cash to be accounted for and reported like assets being held and used 
long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are to be recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell at the time the plan of disposition has been approved and committed to by the appropriate company management 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  effective june   a triggering event occurred and we recorded an impairment charge of approximately billion 
we also recorded other asset impairment charges during totaling million 
see note property  plant and equipment to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further information 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections as of april sfas no 

we adopted sfas no 
effective january  this statement eliminates the automatic classification of gain or loss on extinguishments of debt as an extraordinary item and requires that such gain or loss be evaluated for extraordinary classification under the criteria of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations 
this statement also requires sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions and makes various other technical corrections to existing pronouncements 
as a result  our gains and losses on debt extinguishments have been reclassified to other income and expense in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 which is effective for financial statements related to periods ending after december  sfas no 
requires expanded disclosure regarding stock based compensation which we have included in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  was issued in november the interpretation provides guidance on the guarantor s accounting and disclosure of guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of the interpretation as of december  the accounting guidelines are applicable to certain guarantees  excluding affiliate guarantees  issued or modified after december   and require that we record a liability for the fair value of such guarantees on our consolidated balance sheet 
the adoption of this interpretation had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in our restated consolidated financial statements  we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  net of income taxes  related to the adoption of sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this million credit represents the fair value of certain warrants to purchase common stock of other companies received by us in exchange for the purchase or sale of goods or services 
in  we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of approximately million  net of income taxes  upon our adoption of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 

the million charge relates to the establishment of deferred revenues and costs for certain activation and installation activities 
previously  installation and activation fees and costs had been recognized in their entirety at the time the installation or activation was completed 
under the rules of sab no 
 these installation and activation fees are recognized ratably over the estimated lives of the customer relationships  which range from two to ten years 
the adjustment to the cumulative effect previously reported is further described in note restatement of results to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
new accounting standards on january   we adopted sfas no

this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs  generally referred to as asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a legal liability for an asset retirement obligation required to be settled under law or written or oral contract 
if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made  the fair value of the liability shall be recognized in the period it is incurred  or if not  in the period a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
this cost is initially capitalized and then amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset 
we have determined that we have legal asset retirement obligations associated with the removal of a limited group of long lived assets and recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle charge upon adoption of sfas no 
of million liability of million net of an asset of million in prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we have included in our group depreciation rates estimated net removal costs removal costs less salvage 
these costs have historically been reflected in the calculation of depreciation expense and therefore recognized in accumulated depreciation 
when the assets were actually retired and removal costs were expended  the net removal costs were recorded as a reduction to accumulated depreciation 
while sfas no 
requires the recognition of a liability for asset retirement obligations that are legally binding  it precludes the recognition of a liability for asset retirement obligations that are not legally binding 
therefore  upon adoption of sfas no 
 we reversed the net removal costs within accumulated depreciation for those fixed assets where the removal costs exceeded the estimated salvage value and we did not have a legal removal obligation 
this resulted in income from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million in on a going forward basis  the net costs of removal related to these assets will be charged to our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the costs are incurred 
as a result  the adoption of sfas no 
is expected to decrease our depreciation expense on an annual basis by approximately million and increase operating expenses related to the accretion of the fair value of our legal asset retirement obligations by approximately million annually beginning january  based on historical charges and activity through the six months ended june   we believe that recurring removal costs will be approximately million to million annually 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 
 which is applicable for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  this statement requires that liabilities for costs that are associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
it nullifies the guidance of emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf no 

under eitf no 
 an entity recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date that the entity committed itself to an exit plan 
sfas no 
concludes that an entity s commitment to a plan does not  by itself  create a present obligation to other parties that meets the definition of a liability 
in accordance with sfas no 
 our restructuring activities that were recorded prior to will continue to be accounted for under previous guidance 
our adoption of sfas no 
on january  is not expected to have a material effect on our operating results or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 
 which is effective immediately for all variable interest entities created after january  fin no 
must be applied for the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  for variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february   or the third quarter for us 
fin no 
requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
a primary beneficiary absorbs the majority of the entity s expected losses  if they occur  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  if they occur  or both 
where it is reasonably possible that the information about our variable interest entity relationships must be disclosed or consolidated  we must disclose the nature  purpose  size and activity of the variable interest entity and the maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with the variable interest entity in all financial statements issued after january  we do not expect that the adoption of fin no 
will require consolidation of any previously unconsolidated entities 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  sfas no 

sfas no 
provides guidance on how an entity classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions in october  pre merger qwest and anschutz digital media  inc admi  a subsidiary of anschutz company  formed a joint venture called qwest digital media  llc qdm  which provided advanced digital production  post production and transmission facilities  digital media storage and distribution services  telephony based data storage and enhanced access and routing services 
pre merger qwest contributed capital of approximately million in the form of a promissory note payable over nine years at an annual interest rate of 
at inception  pre merger qwest and admi each owned equity and voting interest in qdm 
in june  we acquired an additional interest in qdm directly from admi and paid million for the interest  million in cash at closing and the remaining million in the form of a promissory note payable in december  with an annual interest rate of 
as a result of this transaction  subsequent to the merger  we owned a economic interest and voting interest in qdm  and admi owned the remaining economic interest and voting interest 
we paid the note associated with this additional interest in full  including approximately million in accrued interest  in january because we have never controlled qdm  we have accounted for our investment in qdm under the equity method of accounting for all periods presented 
in october  we entered into a long term master services agreement with qdm under which qdm agreed to purchase approximately million of telecommunication services through october  and we agreed to extend credit to qdm for the purpose of making payments for the telecommunications services 
each october  qdm would be required to pay us an amount equal to the difference between certain specified annual commitment levels and the amount of services actually purchased under the master services agreement at that time 
in october  we agreed to terminate the master services agreement and release qdm from its obligation under such agreement to acquire telecommunications services from us 
at the same time  qdm agreed to forgive the remaining balance of million that we owed on the promissory note related to the original capital contribution from pre merger qwest 
prior to the termination of the master services agreement  we advanced qdm million  which was the amount it owed to us under the agreement for accrued telecommunications services 
qdm used that advance to pay us the amount owed  including interest on amounts past due 
concurrently with terminating the master services agreement  qdm repaid the million advance under the master services agreement with interest 
qdm made purchases of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
in january  we and admi each loaned qdm approximately million 
in february  in conjunction with admi  we agreed to cease the operations of qdm 
this resulted in an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations for the carrying amount of our investment in qdm of million 
during the remainder of  we loaned qdm an additional million and admi loaned qdm  as of december   the aggregate principal balance and accrued interest outstanding on loans to qdm from us and admi was million and million  respectively 
in october  we agreed to purchase certain telephony related assets and all of the stock of precision systems  inc  a telecommunications solutions provider  from admi in exchange for a promissory note in the amount of million 
the note bears interest at annually with semi annual interest payments and annual principal payments due through during  and  respectively  we paid  million  and million in interest and   and in principal  on the note 
at december   the outstanding accrued interest on the note was approximately million and the outstanding principal balance on the note was approximately million 
in april  we and kpn telecom bv kpn formed kpnqwest  a joint venture  to create a pan european ip based fiber optic broadband network  linked to our network in north america  for data and multimedia services 
we and kpn each initially owned of kpnqwest 
in november  kpnqwest consummated an initial public offering in which million shares of common stock were issued to the public generating approximately billion in proceeds 
as a result of kpnqwest s initial public offering  the public owned approximately of kpnqwest s shares  and the remainder was owned equally by us and kpn 
originally  contractual provisions restricted our ability to sell or transfer any of our shares through in november  we purchased approximately million additional shares  and anschutz company our largest stockholder purchased approximately six million shares  of kpnqwest common stock from kpn for per share 
anschutz company s purchase was at our request and with the approval of the disinterested members of our board of directors 
after giving effect to this transaction  we held approximately of kpnqwest s outstanding shares 
in connection with this transaction  the restrictions on our ability to transfer shares were removed 
because we have never had the ability to designate a majority of the members of the supervisory board or to vote a majority of the voting securities  we have accounted for our investment in kpnqwest using the equity method of accounting for all periods presented 
during  and  we entered into several transactions with kpnqwest for the purchase and sale of optical capacity assets and the provisioning of services  including but not limited to private line  web hosting  ip transit and dia 
we made purchases of these assets and services from kpnqwest totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we recognized revenue on products and services sold to kpnqwest in the amount of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
at december   and  we had a receivable from kpnqwest for these products and services of million  million and million  respectively 
due to kpnqwest s bankruptcy  the full amount of the balance outstanding as of december  is provided for in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
pricing for these services was based on what we believed to be fair market value at the time the transactions were consummated 
some of kpnqwest s sales to us were in accordance with the distribution agreement with kpnqwest  whereby we were  in certain circumstances  the exclusive distributor of certain of kpnqwest s services in north america 
as of december   we had a remaining commitment to purchase up to million euros or million based on a conversion rate at december  worth of network capacity through from kpnqwest 
in connection with kpnqwest s bankruptcy  as discussed in note investments to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  the purchase commitment terminated during june in march  kpnqwest acquired certain assets of global telesystems europe bv gts for convertible notes of kpnqwest with a face amount of million euros million based on a conversion rate at march   among other consideration  under an agreement entered into in october as disclosed to our board of directors  a subsidiary of anschutz company had become a creditor of gts in we understand that in and  as part of a group of gts bondholders  the anschutz company subsidiary also provided interim financing to gts 
in connection with the consummation of kpnqwest s acquisition of the gts assets  the anschutz company subsidiary received a distribution of such notes with a face amount of approximately million euros million based on a conversion rate at march  
we understand that the allocation of notes to the anschutz company subsidiary was determined by a creditor committee for gts which did not include any representatives of anschutz company  and neither the kpnqwest notes nor the shares referenced above  both of which are still held by anschutz company  have any current value 
in  qwest decided to sell an aircraft and purchase a different aircraft 
qwest decided to do so in the form of a like kind exchange transaction under section of the internal revenue code  as amended 
a like kind exchange transaction is one in which a company sells an asset and purchases a similar  or like kind  asset 
in order to qualify as a like kind exchange  the sale of the old asset and the purchase of the new asset must take place within six months of each other 
in november  qwest engaged a third party to facilitate the aircraft exchange  and in december  transferred its aircraft to this party and acquired from the same party another aircraft  which it had acquired on qwest s behalf 
qwest also began marketing the aircraft it intended to sell through an aircraft broker 
at the end of march  qwest received an offer from an independent third party to purchase the aircraft for million 
however  the sale was not completed because the third party failed to consummate the purchase 
in early may  after qwest had not found another party to acquire the aircraft it intended to sell  and as the six month period to complete the like kind exchange was nearing an end  a subsidiary of anschutz company agreed to purchase the aircraft for million  which resulted in significant tax deferrals and savings for qwest 
this transaction was approved by the disinterested members of our board of directors 
we loaned afshin mohebbi  one of our former officers   under a promissory note dated may  the loan was unsecured and did not bear interest 
the promissory note provided that the principal amount was to be forgiven in equal monthly increments beginning july  and ending on june  effective april   we loaned mr 
mohebbi an additional million  which bears interest at the rate of  compounded semi annually 
mr 
mohebbi has agreed to use a portion of the loan to pay the premium on a life insurance policy covering his life 
the outstanding principal balance of the loan  together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon  will be due and payable within days following mr 
mohebbi s death or earlier upon the occurrence of any transfer or surrender of the life insurance policy  any borrowing against or withdrawals of cash from the policy  any pledge of or encumbrance on the policy  or any reduction in the face amount of the policy that results in a distribution of cash value 
mr 
mohebbi is the owner of the life insurance policy 
risk management we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates 
the objective of our interest rate risk management program is to manage the level and volatility of our interest expense 
we may employ derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure 
we may also employ financial derivatives to hedge foreign currency exposures associated with particular debt 
with the settlement of the global crossing derivative in  we no longer hold any derivatives for other than hedging purposes 
as of december  and  approximately billion and billion  respectively  of floating rate debt was exposed to changes in interest rates 
this exposure is linked to commercial paper rates and london interbank offered rates  or libor 
a hypothetical increase of one percentage point in libor and commercial paper rates would increase annual pre tax interest expense by million 
as of december  and  we also had approximately billion of long term fixed rate debt obligations maturing in the following twelve months 
any new debt obtained to refinance this debt would be exposed to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical change in the interest rates on this debt would not have had a material effect on our earnings 
we had billion and billion of long term fixed rate debt at december  and  respectively 
a basis point increase in the interest rates on this debt would result in an increase in the fair value of these instruments of billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in the interest rates on this debt would result in a decrease in the fair value of these instruments of billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
as of december   qwest had billion of cash invested in money market and other short term investments 
most cash investments are invested at floating rates 
as interest rates change so will the interest income derived from these accounts 
special note regarding forward looking statements this form k contains or incorporates by reference forward looking statements  as that term is used in federal securities laws  about our financial condition  results of operations and business 
these statements include  among others statements concerning the benefits that we expect will result from our business activities and certain transactions we have completed  such as increased revenues  decreased expenses and avoided expenses and expenditures  and statements of our expectations  beliefs  future plans and strategies  anticipated developments and other matters that are not historical facts 
these statements may be made expressly in this document or may be incorporated by reference to other documents we will file with the sec 
you can find many of these statements by looking for words such as believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  or similar expressions used in this report or incorporated by reference in this report 
these forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions  risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by us in those statements 
some of these risks are described below under risk factors 
these risk factors should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue 
we do not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
further  the information contained in this document is a statement of our intention as of the date of this filing and is based upon  among other things  the existing regulatory environment  industry conditions  market conditions and prices  the economy in general and our assumptions as of such date 
we may change our intentions  at any time and without notice  based upon any changes in such factors  in our assumptions or otherwise 
you are further cautioned that we have not filed certain of our recent periodic reports with the sec  and we intend to restate information disclosed in certain other reports previously filed with the sec 
we have determined that in certain cases we misinterpreted or misapplied gaap in our and consolidated financial statements and  accordingly  we have restated our consolidated financial statements for the two years ended december  and related interim periods 
because this restatement has also impacted our results  as reflected herein  the information previously filed in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march   our current reports on form k filed on november   february  and may  and any other information that has been previously disclosed should not be relied upon 
the information to be contained in our quarterly reports for our quarters ended on june   september   march  and june  is unavailable at this time 
moreover  we can provide no assurances as to when such information will become available 
risk factors risks affecting our business continued downturn in the economy in our local service area could affect our operating results 
our operations in our local service area of arizona  colorado  idaho  iowa  minnesota  montana  nebraska  new mexico  north dakota  oregon  south dakota  utah  washington and wyoming  from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenues  have been impacted by the continuing weakness in that region s economy 
because customers have less discretionary income  demand for second lines or additional services has declined 
this economic downturn in our local service area has also led to an increased customer disconnection rate 
in addition  several of the companies with which we do business appear to be in financial difficulty or have filed for bankruptcy protection 
some of these have requested renegotiation of long term agreements with us because of their financial circumstances and because they believe the terms of these agreements are no longer appropriate for their needs 
our revenues have been and are likely to continue to be adversely affected by the loss or reduction of business with many of our customers as a result of this downturn and our continued efforts to accommodate our customers needs in this changing business environment 
we believe that our local service area s economy lagged the national economy in entering the downturn and may follow the national economy in recovery by an indeterminate period 
this continued economic slowdown will affect demand for our products and services within our local service area 
we face pressure on profit margins as a result of increasing competition  including product substitution  which could adversely affect our operating results and financial performance 
we compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market  and we expect competition to intensify 
we have faced greater competition in our core local business from cable companies  wireless providers including ourselves  facilities based providers using their own networks as well as those leasing parts of our network unbundled network elements  or unes  and resellers 
one of the primary reasons we continue to experience loss of access lines is the intense competition from cable and wireless providers offering a substitute for our traditional voice and data services 
we are implementing new strategies for enhancing our video and wireless offerings 
however  it will be difficult to effectively execute our strategy in the face of increasing competition 
for example  our recently announced wireless strategy of reselling sprint wireless services to our customers is untested 
we may not be able to effectively integrate sprint s services into our product offerings  and it may require greater resources than we anticipate to operate as a wireless reseller 
also  while we recently entered into strategic marketing arrangements with echostar and directv to bundle their satellite television products and services with our traditional telecommunications  data and internet offerings  our video offering remains limited to select markets in our local service area 
if we are unable to effectively implement our strategy for improving video and wireless solutions  both our wireless and our traditional telephone businesses may be adversely affected 
we have also begun to experience and expect further increased competitive pressure from telecommunications providers either emerging from bankruptcy protection or reorganizing their capital structure to more effectively compete against us 
as a result of these increased competitive pressures  we have been and may continue to be forced to respond with lower profit margin product offerings and pricing schemes that allow us to retain and attract customers 
these pressures could adversely affect our operating results and financial performance 
our ability to compete will depend  in part  on our ability to provide competitive interlata services 
in order to successfully compete  we believe we need to be able to offer a ubiquitous long distance service utilizing our proprietary telecommunications network assets 
under the telecommunications act of  we were not permitted to provide interlata services in the states where we provided service as an incumbent local exchange carrier until we satisfied certain regulatory conditions set forth in the telecommunications act primarily related to local exchange telephone competition 
these restrictions generally prohibited us from providing service between the multiple latas in such states and between such states and the rest of the country  including providing private line service  long distance services originating in such states  and toll free long distance services terminating in such states 
to date  the fcc has approved our applications to provide interlata services in all the states in our local service area other than arizona 
we made our application with the fcc with respect to arizona on september  even though the interlata restrictions have now been eliminated in most states in the local service area  our long distance operations are subject to various regulatory constraints  including the requirement that interlata services be offered through a subsidiary that is structurally separated from our local exchange company 
also  we are restricted from fully utilizing our proprietary telecommunications assets in the provision of interlata services in our local service area until we have completed additional steps required by the fcc 
as a result  within our local service area we currently provide only switched interlata long distance services and do not provide some of the data and internet services that we provide outside our local service area 
these restrictions have resulted in lower margins in our current long distance business than we would have without them and have kept us from rolling out additional products and services in our local service area 
as a result  our ability to compete has been and may continue to be significantly impacted 
rapid changes in technology and markets could require substantial expenditure of financial and other resources in excess of contemplated levels  and any inability to respond to those changes could reduce our market share 
the telecommunications industry is experiencing significant technological changes  and our ability to execute on our business plans and compete depends upon our ability to develop new products and accelerate the deployment of advanced new services  such as broadband data  wireless and video services 
the development and deployment of new products could require substantial expenditure of financial and other resources in excess of contemplated levels 
if we are not able to develop new products to keep pace with technological advances  or if such products are not widely accepted by customers  our ability to compete could be adversely affected and our market share could decline 
any inability to keep up with changes in technology and markets could also adversely affect the trading price of our securities and our ability to service our debt 
risks relating to legal and regulatory matters any adverse outcome of investigations currently being conducted by the sec and the us attorney s office or the assessment being undertaken by the gsa could have a material adverse impact on us  on the trading price for our securities and on our ability to access the capital markets 
on april   the sec issued an order of investigation that made formal an informal investigation initiated on march  we are continuing in our efforts to cooperate fully with the sec in its investigation 
the investigation includes  without limitation  inquiry into several specifically identified qwest accounting practices and transactions and related disclosures that are the subject of the various adjustments and restatements described in this form k 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of and consolidated financial statements above and note restatement of results to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for more information about our restatement 
the investigation also includes inquiry into disclosure and other issues related to transactions between us and certain of our vendors and certain investments in the securities of those vendors by individuals associated with us 
on july   we were informed by the us attorney s office for the district of colorado of a criminal investigation of qwest 
we believe the us attorney s office is investigating various matters that include the subjects of the investigation by the sec 
while we are continuing in our efforts to cooperate fully with the sec and the us attorney s office in each of their respective investigations  we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations 
we are currently in discussions with the sec staff in an effort to resolve the issues raised in the sec s investigation of qwest 
such discussions are preliminary and we cannot predict the likelihood of whether those discussions will result in a settlement and  if so  the terms of such settlement 
however  settlements typically involve  among other things  the sec making claims under the federal securities laws in a complaint filed in united states district court that  for purposes of the settlement  the defendant neither admits nor denies 
we would expect such claims to address many of the accounting practices and transactions and related disclosures that are the subject of the various restatements we have made as well as additional transactions 
in addition  any settlement with the sec may also involve  among other things  the imposition of a civil penalty  the amount of which could be material  and the entry of a court order that would require  among other things  that we and our officers and directors comply with provisions of the federal securities laws as to which there have been allegations of prior violations 
in addition  as previously reported  the sec has conducted an investigation concerning our earnings release for the fourth quarter and full year issued on january  the release provided pro forma normalized earnings information that excluded certain nonrecurring expense and income items resulting primarily from our acquisition of u s west 
on november   the sec staff informed us of its intent to recommend that the sec authorize an action against us that would allege we should have included in the earnings release a statement of our earnings in accordance with gaap 
at the date of this filing  no action has been taken by the sec 
however  we expect that if our current discussions with the staff of the sec result in a settlement  such settlement would include allegations concerning the january  earnings release 
also  the gsa is conducting a review of all contracts with us for purposes of determining present responsibility 
recently  the inspector general of the gsa referred to the gsa suspension debarment official the question of whether qwest should be considered for debarment 
we are cooperating fully with the gsa and believe that we will remain a supplier of the government  although we cannot predict the outcome of this referral 
an adverse outcome with respect to one or more of the sec investigations  the us attorney s office investigation or the gsa evaluation could have material and significant adverse impact upon us 
the breadth of our internal analysis of our accounting policies  practices and procedures  the passage of time and the turnover in accounting personnel or further review by the sec could result in additional adjustments 
we continue to discuss our periodic filings with the staff of the sec s division of corporation finance 
they have reviewed our form k and our form q for the three months ended march  as appropriate  we have attempted to address the staff s comments in our current filings and have provided responses to those other comments that we could address 
following their review of our form k we may receive additional comments from the staff of the division of corporation finance and may be required to make further adjustments or additional disclosures 
it is possible that these comments may lead to further investigations from the sec s division of enforcement 
while we have attempted to address all the matters identified in our internal analysis of our accounting policies  practices and procedures  due to the breadth of this analysis  the passage of time and the turnover in accounting personnel employed by us  we may have overlooked some matters in our internal analysis 
major lawsuits have been brought against us involving our accounting practices and other matters 
the outcomes of these lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
several lawsuits have been filed against us  as well as certain of our past and present officers and directors 
these lawsuits include putative class action lawsuits in which the plaintiffs allege numerous violations of securities laws 
in one of these actions  lead counsel for the plaintiffs has indicated that plaintiffs will seek damages in the billions of dollars 
the consolidated securities action  the consolidated erisa action and the calstrs  new jersey and sursi actions described above present material and significant risk to us 
some of the allegations in these lawsuits include many of the same subjects that the sec and us attorney s office are investigating 
moreover  the size  scope and nature of the restatements that we are making in this report affect the risk presented by these cases 
while we intend to defend against these matters vigorously  the ultimate outcomes of these cases are very uncertain  and we can give no assurance as to the impacts on our financial results or financial condition as a result of these matters 
each of these cases is in a preliminary phase 
none of the plaintiffs or the defendants has advanced evidence concerning possible recoverable damages  and we have not yet conducted discovery on these and other relevant issues 
thus  we are unable at this time to estimate reasonably a range of loss that we would incur if the plaintiffs in one or more of these lawsuits were to prevail 
any settlement of or judgment on one or more of these claims could be material  and we cannot give any assurance that we would have the resources available to pay such judgments 
also  our ability to meet our debt service obligations and our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  underwriters of the director and officer and fiduciary insurance policies identified above have informed us that they seek to rescind their policies or otherwise deny coverage that such policies may provide to cover any losses on these claims 
we recently reached a preliminary  non binding agreement with our carriers to resolve our disputes 
if a definitive settlement agreement is not executed and approved by october   the parties may litigate their disputes on or after october  we intend to vigorously oppose the insurance carriers efforts to rescind or otherwise deny coverage under the policies identified above if we are unable to reach a definitive settlement with the carriers 
however  there can be no assurance that we will enter into a definitive settlement agreement with the carriers  or that we will not incur a material loss with respect to these matters 
while we believe that  in the event the insurance carriers are successful in rescinding coverage  other insurance policies may provide partial coverage 
however  there is risk that none of the claims we have made under the qwest policies described above will be covered by such other policies 
in any event  the terms and conditions of the applicable certificates or articles of incorporation  applicable bylaws  applicable law and any applicable agreements may obligate us to indemnify and advance legal expenses to our current and former directors  officers  and employees for any liabilities related to these claims 
further  given the size and nature of our business  we are subject from time to time to various other lawsuits which  depending on their outcome  may have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
thus  we can give no assurances as to the impacts on our financial results or financial condition as a result of these matters 
increased scrutiny of financial disclosure  particularly in the telecommunications industry in which we operate  could reduce investor confidence and affect our business opportunities  and any restatement of our earnings as stated in this filing could limit our ability to access the capital markets and could increase litigation risks 
as a result of our accounting issues and the increased scrutiny of financial disclosure  investor confidence in us has suffered and could suffer further 
congress  the sec  other government authorities and the media are intensely scrutinizing a number of financial reporting issues and practices 
in addition to the sec investigation discussed earlier  we have reported that the sec has investigated our earnings release for the fourth quarter and full year and that the staff of the sec has decided to recommend an action against us alleging that we should also have included in the earnings release a statement of our gaap earnings 
although all businesses face uncertainty with respect to how the us financial disclosure regime may be impacted by this process  particular attention has been focused recently on the telecommunications industry 
congressional hearings held in  for example  related to the telecommunications industry practice of accounting for irus  as well as the appropriateness and consistency of pro forma financial information disclosure 
some of our former and current officers and directors have testified at these hearings concerning irus and other matters 
the existence of this heightened scrutiny and these pending investigations could adversely affect investor confidence and cause the trading price for our securities to decline 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will not have to further restate earnings for prior periods as a result of any formal actions  the sec s review of our filings or because of our own periodic internal investigations 
any such restatement could further impact our ability to access the capital markets and the trading price of our securities 
we operate in a highly regulated industry  and are therefore exposed to restrictions on our manner of doing business and a variety of claims relating to such regulation 
our operations are subject to extensive federal regulation  including the communications act of  as amended  and fcc regulations thereunder 
we are also subject to the applicable laws and regulations of various states  including regulation by public utility commissions pucs and other state agencies 
federal laws and fcc regulations apply to interstate telecommunications including international telecommunications that originate or terminate in the united states  while state regulatory authorities have jurisdiction over telecommunications that originate and terminate within the same state 
generally  we must obtain and maintain certificates of authority from regulatory bodies in most states where we offer intrastate services and must obtain prior regulatory approval of tariffs for our intrastate services in most of these jurisdictions 
regulation of the telecommunications industry is changing rapidly  and the regulatory environment varies substantially from state to state 
all of our operations are also subject to a variety of environmental  safety  health and other governmental regulations 
there can be no assurance that future regulatory  judicial or legislative activities will not have a material adverse effect on our operations  or that domestic or international regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with regard to our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations 
we monitor our compliance with federal  state and local regulations governing the discharge and disposal of hazardous and environmentally sensitive materials  including the emission of electromagnetic radiation 
although we believe that we are in compliance with such regulations  any such discharge  disposal or emission might expose us to claims or actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
risks affecting our liquidity our high debt levels and the restrictive terms of our debt instruments pose risks to our viability and may make us more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive conditions  as well as other adverse developments 
we are highly leveraged 
as of september   our consolidated debt was approximately billion 
as shown above in item liquidity and capital resources payment obligations and contingencies  a significant amount of our debt obligations come due over the next few years 
while we currently believe we will have the financial resources to meet our obligations when they come due  we cannot anticipate what our future condition will be 
we may have unexpected costs and liabilities and we may have limited access to financing 
we have recently taken the following measures to improve our near term liquidity and our capital structure and generally reduce financial risk amended and restated our credit facility in order to a lengthen the maturity  b obtain more flexible covenants and c achieve a more favorable amortization schedule  sold the dex directory publishing business  which generated gross cash proceeds of billion  reduced capital investment and continued to manage working capital  and refinanced qc debt due in with debt that has maturities in and however  even if we are successful in our de leveraging efforts  we may need to obtain additional financing to meet our debt service obligations if operations do not improve  if revenue and operating cash flow declines are worse than expected  if economic conditions do not improve  or if we become subject to significant judgements and or settlements in connection with the resolution of one or more matters described under securities actions and derivative actions in item of this report 
the qsc credit facility also includes financial maintenance covenants with which we must comply 
any failure to do so could result in an event of default and an acceleration of our outstanding debt obligations 
if we fail to repay indebtedness in respect of the qsc credit facility or any of our other indebtedness when due  or fail to comply with the financial maintenance covenants contained in the qsc credit facility  the applicable creditors or their representatives could declare the entire amount owed under such indebtedness immediately due and payable 
any such event could adversely affect our ability to conduct business or access the capital markets and could adversely impact our credit ratings 
additionally  the degree to which we are leveraged may have important limiting consequences  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or general corporate purposes may be impaired  our leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage as compared with our less leveraged competitors  including some who have significantly reduced their debt through a bankruptcy proceeding  our leverage may make us more vulnerable to the current or future downturns in general economic conditions or in any of our businesses  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited  and our high debt levels could adversely impact our credit ratings 
we may be unable to significantly reduce the substantial capital requirements or operating expenses necessary to continue to operate our business  which may in turn affect our operating results 
we anticipate that our capital requirements relating to maintaining and routinely upgrading our network will continue to be significant in the coming years 
we also may be unable to significantly reduce the operating expenses associated with our future contractual cash obligations  including future purchase commitments  which may in turn affect our operating results 
as we will need to maintain the quality of our products and services in the future  we may be unable to further significantly reduce such capital requirements or operating expenses  even if revenues are decreasing 
such nondiscretionary capital outlays may lessen our ability to compete with other providers who face less significant spending requirements 
if we are unable to renegotiate a significant portion of our future purchase commitments  we may suffer related losses 
as of december   our aggregate future purchase commitments totaled billion and we expect them to total billion by december  we entered into these commitments  which obligate us to purchase network services and capacity  hardware or advertising from other vendors  with the expectation that we would use these commitments in association with projected revenues 
we currently do not expect to generate revenues in the near term that are sufficient to offset the costs associated with some of these commitments 
although we are attempting to renegotiate and restructure certain of these contracts  there can be no assurance that we will be successful to any material degree 
if we cannot renegotiate or restructure a significant portion of these contracts on terms that are favorable to us  we will continue to have substantial ongoing expenses without sufficient revenues to offset the expenses related to these arrangements 
in addition  we may incur substantial losses in connection with these restructurings and renegotiations 
declines in the value of pension plan assets could require us to provide significant amounts of funding for our pension plans while we do not expect to be required to make material cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plan in the near term based upon current actuarial analyses and forecasts  a further significant decline in the value of pension plan assets in the future or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required pension funding 
as a result  we may be required to fund our benefit plans with cash from operations  perhaps by a material amount 
if we pursue and are involved in any business combinations  our financial condition could be affected 
on a regular and on going basis  we review and evaluate other businesses and opportunities for business combinations that would be strategically beneficial 
as a result  we may be involved in negotiations or discussions that  if they were to result in a transaction  could have a material effect on our financial condition including short term or long term liquidity or short term or long term results of operations 
other risks affecting qwest we have postponed the filing of our most recent quarterly reports  and material information concerning our current operating results and financial condition is therefore unavailable 
we have postponed the filing of our periodic reports for the quarters ended march  and june   and the information to be contained therein is unavailable at this time 
we may also need to delay the filing of our periodic report for the quarter ending september  while we released first quarter earnings information in our current report on form k filed on may  and second quarter earnings information in our current report on form k filed on september   this information was limited  incomplete and may be inconsistent with the information contained herein 
we cannot predict how soon complete financial and operational information relating to our first two quarters for will become available 
when it is  it may reflect changes or trends that are material to our business 
also  many of our loan documents  including the qsc credit facility  contain financial reporting covenants that require delivery of annual and quarterly periodic reports  and the failure to comply with these financial reporting covenants can result in a default under certain of our loan documents 
we have obtained extensions under the qsc credit facility for the delivery of our unfiled first and second quarter periodic reports to december  if conditions or assumptions differ from the judgments  assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies  the accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our critical accounting policies  which are set forth above  describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these accounting policies are considered critical because they require judgments  assumptions and estimates that materially impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
as a result  if future events differ significantly from the judgments  assumptions  and estimates in our critical accounting policies or different assumptions are used in the future  such events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
taxing authorities may determine we owe additional taxes relating to various matters  which could adversely affect our financial results 
as a significant taxpayer  historically we have been subject to frequent and regular audits from the internal revenue service  or the irs  as well as from state and local tax authorities 
these audits could subject us to risk due to adverse positions that may be taken by these tax authorities 
for example  the irs has proposed a tax adjustment for tax years through the principal issue involves our allocation of costs between long term contracts with customers for the installation of conduit or fiber optic cable and additional conduit or fiber optic cable retained by us 
the irs disputes our allocation of the costs between us and third parties for whom we were building similar network assets during the same time period 
similar claims have been asserted against us with respect to and  and it is possible that claims could be made against us for other periods 
we are contesting these claims and do not believe the irs will be successful 
even if they are  we believe that any significant tax obligations will be substantially offset as a result of available net operating losses and tax sharing agreements 
however  the ultimate effect of these claims is uncertain 
also  as a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated us federal income tax return  we could be severally liable for tax examinations and adjustments not directly applicable to current members of the qwest affiliated group 
tax sharing agreements have been executed between us and previous affiliates  and we believe the liabilities if any arising from adjustments to tax liability would be borne by the affiliated group member determined to have a deficiency under the terms and conditions of such agreements and applicable tax law 
we have not provided for the liability of former affiliated members in our financial statements 
as a result of the restatement of our financial results  previously filed returns and reports may be required by legal  regulatory  or administrative provisions to be amended to reflect the tax related impacts if any of such restatements 
where legal  regulatory or administrative rules would require or allow us to amend our previous tax filings  we intend to comply with our obligations under applicable law 
to the extent that tax authorities do not accept the tax consequences of restatement entries  liabilities for taxes could differ materially from what has been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
while we believe we have adequately provided for taxes associated with these restatements  risks and contingencies  tax audits and examinations may result in liabilities that differ materially from those we have recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time  or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage  our business and operating results could be materially harmed 
we are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions  which represent a significant number of our employees 
although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory  no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time 
if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements  if disputes with our unions arise  or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage  we could incur higher ongoing labor costs or experience a significant disruption of operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we recently reached agreements with the communications workers of america and the international brotherhood of electrical workers on new two year labor contracts 
each of these agreements was ratified by union members  went into effect on august  and expires on august  the trading price of our securities could be volatile 
in recent years  the capital markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the overall market and the trading price of our securities may fluctuate greatly 
the trading price of our securities may be significantly affected by various factors  including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  changes in investors and analysts perception of the business risks and conditions of our business  broader market fluctuations  and general economic or political conditions
