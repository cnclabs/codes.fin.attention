overview we are a digital marketing services and technology company that helps marketers acquire  retain  and grow customers across digital media 
we are organized into two lines of business  digital marketing services  including our avenue a and i frontier operating units  and digital marketing technologies  through our atlas dmt operating unit 
through our interactive advertising agencies  avenue a and i frontier  which we acquired in november  we offer advertisers a suite of services that enable those advertisers to increase the effectiveness and return on investment of their internet advertising campaigns 
our agency core services include media planning and buying  ad serving  campaign analysis  optimization  data collection and aggregation and creative and web site development 
in addition  we offer our clients services such as our strategic partnership program  customer targeting  e mail  customer insights  search engine optimization  and products such as vital signs and avondale 
through our atlas dmt operating unit  we provide large traditional advertising agencies  specialty interactive advertising agencies  and large advertisers who buy media directly with the ability to manage online media planning  buying  ad delivery and analysis 
our proprietary digital marketing management system is known as the atlas digital marketing suite  which is an end to end solution that consists of the atlas media console  the atlas creative management system  the atlas delivery and tracking service  and the atlas analysis and optimization engine 
we also offer our clients additional online tools such as vital signs  grp and reach forecaster 
in response to the decline in exclusively internet based client companies and the general decrease in advertising expenditures in  we reduced the size of our operations  including closing our international advertising agency offices in we completed reductions in workforce during september and january and may as a result of these personnel reductions and other reductions in expenses  expenses in dollars for the year ended december  and are lower than expenses for the year ended december  critical accounting policies and judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the united states securities and exchange commission the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies 
table of contents and judgments addressed below 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenue in and has been recognized on a gross basis in accordance with the final consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf in july on eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
revenue generated under gross method contracts  which consists of the gross value of our billings to our clients  includes the price of the advertising space that we purchase from web sites to resell to our clients 
to generate revenue under these contracts  we purchase advertising space from publisher web sites and sell the purchased space to our clients and are ultimately responsible for payment to web sites for the cost of space we purchase 
we also recognize revenue for certain contracts with clients under the net method 
to generate revenue under net method contracts  we buy advertising space from publisher web sites on behalf of our clients and earn fees based on the dollar amount of advertising space we purchase 
under net method contracts  our clients are primarily responsible for payment to the publisher web sites for the cost of the advertising space purchased 
all such revenue  including revenue from our core services  the strategic partnership program and customer targeting  is recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered or services are provided 
during  we intend to revise contractual agreements with clients and online publishers so that direct liability for media purchases will rest with avenue a s clients 
we intend to make these new contractual terms effective january  accordingly  beginning on january   we intend to generate all revenue under net method contracts 
we believe that these net method contracts will be consistent with the type of contracts that most advertising agencies use and will better facilitate financial comparisons with competitors in our industry 
we also believe that this change in contracts will standardize contractual terms and revenue presentation among our interactive advertising agency operating units and mitigate state tax and certain other business obligations 
the tables below provide a reconciliation of revenue as reported to net revenue  which excludes the cost of media purchased for our avenue a clients in thousands revenue  as reported less cost of media purchases net revenue march june september december quarter ended revenue  as reported less cost of media purchases net revenue quarter ended revenue  as reported less cost of media purchases net revenue quarter ended revenue  as reported less cost of media purchases net revenue 
table of contents e mail is a volume based service  and revenue is generally recognized when impressions are delivered 
we recognize revenue from search engine optimization programs based on either volume or as a subscription 
revenue from the volume based service is generally recognized when impressions are delivered and revenue from the subscription based service is recognized ratably over the service period 
vital signs and avondale are monthly subscription based services  and revenue is recognized for each month that the service is provided 
revenue is generally recognized for customer insight services under a proportional performance method of accounting 
it is our policy to recognize any loss on services as soon as management estimates indicate a loss will occur 
historically  we have not generated losses on these types of contracts 
our atlas dmt operating unit provides digital marketing technology services to manage online media planning  buying  ad delivery and analysis for advertising agencies and advertisers 
these services are offered online through the atlas digital marketing suite as are our other services such as vital signs and grp and reach forecaster 
such services are recognized based on either volume or subscription 
revenue from the volume based services is recognized based on the volume in the period of usage 
revenue from subscription based services is recognized ratably over the service period 
revenue is deferred in cases where we have not yet earned advertising revenue but have billed the customer or received payment from the customer prior to providing the services 
revenue is recognized only when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue also includes any reimbursements received from our clients related to expenses incurred by our employees in servicing our clients 
such expenses include airfare  mileage  meals and hotel stays 
accounting for acquisitions in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations 
in connection with our acquisition of i frontier in november  we allocated the cost of the acquisition to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at date of acquisition in accordance with sfas no 
as a result  the excess of the purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired was allocated to the following non compete agreement customer relationships developed technology goodwill significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value at date of acquisition including estimating future cash flows from the acquired business  determining appropriate discount rates  asset lives  and other assumptions 
accounting for goodwill and certain other intangibles in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which provides accounting and reporting standards for acquired intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but tested for impairment at least annually 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  and completed a transitional impairment test for the intangible assets recorded in connection with the purchase of avenue a nyc llc in september upon adoption of sfas no 
 we reclassified all previously recorded intangible assets as goodwill  as those assets related to workforce and customer base  did not meet the criteria under sfas no 
for separate identification 
furthermore  as a result of the impairment test  we recorded an impairment charge of million that has been recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  
table of contents in connection with our acquisition of i frontier in november  we recorded certain goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
the separable intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated lives  ranging from three to seven years 
we will perform an impairment test on goodwill  in accordance with the guidance provided by sfas no 
 at least annually  unless events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
we will perform our yearly impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of impairment adjustments recognized  if any  generally are recognized as operating expenses 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
the i frontier purchase agreement also includes future contingent payments in and  which will be determined based upon the operating results of i frontier through december  any contingent payments will be recorded as goodwill 
the calculation of the contingent payments is based upon a combination of a multiple of earnings through december  and an amount equal to the value of net assets at the date of acquisition 
the agreement includes the potential for an interim payment based upon i frontier earnings during the two years ending december   which is partially refundable based upon i frontier earnings during the four years ending december  during this period  the assets recorded in connection with the contingent payments will be adjusted as actual earnings become known 
these adjustments require judgment  including estimating the future earnings of i frontier 
accounting for stock based compensation we have currently elected to apply the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the company applies accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans 
a number of companies have recently adopted or announced their intention to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
to respond to concerns raised by constituents  in december  the fasb issued sfas accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas no 
 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we are currently evaluating the alternative methods of transition and if we decide to voluntarily adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation  this could have a significant impact on our operating results 
estimates and assumptions related to financial statements the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those affecting revenues  the allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets  goodwill  state  local and federal income taxes and general business contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
washington state tax authorities issued a ruling in that permits us to exclude amounts paid by us to purchase media for clients  that is ultimately billed to and paid for by clients  from the measure of washington state business and occupation tax 
we have received reporting instructions from washington state tax authorities 
table of contents that disallow this exclusion in future periods beginning in february we are considering alternatives to mitigate the resulting adverse tax consequences  including evaluation of tax strategies that might allow deduction of media purchases in connection with the measure of business and occupation tax and assertion of administrative remedies in accordance with washington state tax regulations 
results of operations the following table presents  in dollars and as a percentage of revenue  statements of operations data for the years ended december   and our discussion of revenue and cost of revenue that follows provides a reconciliation of revenue and cost of revenue as reported and revenue and cost of revenue as if cost of media purchases were excluded net revenue 
we believe the net revenue analysis facilitates a better comparison of our digital marketing services against other companies in our industry  since many of these companies also exclude the cost of media from reported revenue 
furthermore  due to the prospective contractual changes discussed previously  we believe this measure will enhance comparability in future periods 
the results of any period are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

table of contents revenue 
the following table provides a reconciliation of revenue as reported to net revenue  which excludes the cost of media purchased for our avenue a clients 
revenue  as reported less cost of media purchases net revenue revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenue from digital marketing services increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenue from our digital marketing technologies increased to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  during and  we experienced a transition in customer base from primarily internet based companies to companies in more traditional industries 
the increase in revenue in was primarily due to increases in spending for our digital marketing services among our existing customers who operate in more traditional industries 
we believe companies are beginning to understand the effectiveness of online media  resulting in growth of their online budgets 
during  our digital marketing services were able to help launch major campaign initiatives  where historically these campaigns were reserved for more traditional advertising media 
during the year ended december   revenue from our top customers was of our total revenue compared to during the year ended december  in addition  during the year ended december   three customers  each accounting for over of our total revenue  accounted for of our total revenue  compared to during the year ended december  revenue from our digital marketing technologies increased as our atlas digital marketing suite gained acceptance in the marketplace by adding clients such as agencies and direct advertisers 
in its first full year as a stand alone operating unit  atlas dmt ended with over clients  compared to clients as of december  during  we expect digital marketing services revenue will grow  with an increasing contribution from new clients and a full year of revenue contribution from i frontier 
in addition  we expect digital marketing technologies to continue to grow its revenue from agencies and direct advertisers 
accordingly  we expect total revenues of to million in revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in total revenue was primarily due to two factors 
first  revenue contributions from exclusively internet based clients had declined due to the economic downturn in the internet sector that had caused many of these companies to discontinue operations or to reduce advertising spending 
second  weaknesses in the economy had caused many advertisers to reduce advertising spending 
we began generating revenue in digital marketing technologies during the third quarter of  but overall revenue contributions from this line of business were only  for the year ended december  net revenue  which excludes the cost of media purchases  increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in net revenue was primarily due to increases in spending from our existing customers and new fee based services introduced during in addition  revenue from digital marketing technologies increased to million in  compared to  in  as our atlas digital marketing suite gained acceptance in the marketplace by adding clients from external agencies and direct advertisers 
net revenue  which excludes the cost of media purchases  decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to decreased revenue contributions from exclusively internet based clients and weaknesses in the economy that caused many advertisers to reduce advertising spending 

table of contents cost of revenue 
the following table provides a reconciliation of cost of revenue as reported to cost of revenue exclusive of the cost of media purchased for our avenue a clients 
cost of revenue  as reported less cost of media purchases cost of revenue  exclusive of media purchases cost of revenue consists mainly of the costs of media that we purchase from publishers web sites  and the variable costs of delivering the advertisements over the internet 
it also consists of costs paid to third parties for email delivery and search engine optimization 
cost of revenue increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the dollar increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to increases in the volume of advertising space we purchased for our clients  as spending for our services increased among our existing customers 
due to the expected growth in revenue from existing clients and increased contribution from new clients  we anticipate cost of revenue from to million during in  we do not anticipate a significant increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue 
cost of revenue decreased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the dollar decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to decreases in the volume of advertising space we purchased for our clients as the revenue we generated from exclusively internet based clients declined due to the economic downturn in the internet sector and weaknesses in the economy that caused many advertisers to reduce advertising spending 
the percentage decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to increased revenue contribution from higher margin products such as the strategic partnership program and customer insight group services  improved pricing in our core services  and an increase in revenue generated under net method contracts 
the cost of revenue exclusive of media purchases decreased to million for the year ended december  from and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreases in cost of revenue under the net revenue method were primarily due to decreases in the variable cost of delivering advertisements over the internet  specifically bandwidth costs 
bandwidth costs at a per advertisement level have continued to decrease 
in  bandwidth costs also decreased due to the decrease in volume of ads served

client support expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for client support personnel

client support expenses also include client service employees within digital marketing technologies 
client support expenses increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the dollar increase in client support expenses was primarily due to increased headcount in account management needed to support increased spending by our digital marketing services clients and the new clients added in our digital marketing technologies line of business 
the decrease in client support expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to increased revenue from existing clients  while headcount and the related expenses for client support staff increased at a slower rate 
in general  we can support increased spending from existing clients with modest increases in client support costs 
with the expected increase in revenues in from new clients  we anticipate an increase in need for client support staff  which we expect will result in a dollar increase in client support expenses in in addition  we expect client support expenses will increase due to the acquisition of i frontier 
in  we anticipate a modest increase in client support expenses as a percentage of revenue 

table of contents client support expenses decreased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the dollar decrease in client support expenses was primarily due to the reductions in workforce completed during the year 
in january and march  we terminated and employees  respectively

product development 
product development expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for product development as well as research and development personnel 
in addition  product development expenses include the costs of software development and the costs incurred in preparing our atlas digital marketing suite for marketing to external clients 
product development expenses decreased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the dollar and percentage decreases in product development expenses were primarily due to the reduction in workforce completed in in which we terminated employees in our atlas dmt operating unit 
in connection with our reduction in workforce  we also reduced our professional services expenses associated with product development 
in  we anticipate product development expenses in dollars to remain relatively consistent with and product development expenses as a percentage of revenue to have a modest decrease 
product development expenses decreased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the dollar decrease in product development expenses was primarily due to the reductions in workforce completed during the year partially offset by the increase in the number of personnel used to develop our atlas digital marketing suite 
the increase in product development expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to increased expenses associated with the development of our atlas digital marketing suite  while revenue contributions from digital marketing technologies were minimal and revenue from digital marketing services decreased in selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  sales  finance  marketing  human resource and administrative personnel  professional fees  and other general corporate expenses including rent

depreciation and amortization of property and equipment 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment consists primarily of depreciation expense on computer equipment  furniture and fixtures  and software costs and amortization expense of leasehold improvements 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment decreased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the dollar and percentage decreases 
table of contents were primarily due to the sale and write off of excess equipment and reduced spending for new equipment  which resulted from our reductions in workforce in we anticipate that depreciation and amortization of property and equipment will approximate amounts reported for  as our assets purchased in will begin to fully depreciate and property and equipment will be purchased for replacement 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the dollar and percentage increases in depreciation of property and equipment were primarily due to the million in purchases of property and equipment during  compared to million in amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets relates to the customer base  developed technology  non compete agreement  and workforce assets recorded in connection with the purchase of i frontier in november and avenue a nyc llc in september amortization of intangible assets was  or of revenue  for the year ended december   million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  and million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the amortization of intangible assets related exclusively to the i frontier acquisition completed in november during the year ended december   the amortization of intangible assets related exclusively to the avenue a nyc llc acquisition

 we reclassified all previously recorded intangible assets as goodwill  as those assets  related to workforce and customer base  did not meet the criteria under sfas no 
for separate identification 
furthermore  as a result of the impairment test  we recorded an impairment charge of million that has been recognized as a cumulative effect on prior years of a change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december   intangible assets consisted of a non compete agreement  customer base  and developed technology with values of  million  and  respectively 
the intangible assets will be amortized on a straight line basis over useful lives of five  seven  and three years  respectively 
in  we anticipate approximately  of amortization expense associated with our i frontier acquisition 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation consists of expenses related to employee stock option grants with option exercise prices below the fair value of our common stock as of the date of grant 
deferred stock compensation is being amortized on an accelerated basis over the four year vesting period of the applicable options 
amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december   million  or of revenue  for the year ended december   and million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the dollar and percentage decreases were primarily related to the decrease in deferred stock compensation due to our use of the accelerated method of amortization for our employee stock compensation arrangements plus the reversal of balances of unamortized stock based compensation as a result of employee terminations 
we anticipate that deferred stock compensation will decrease in and all deferred stock compensation recorded as a result of options granted prior to our initial public offering will be fully amortized by the end of impairment of fixed assets 
impairment of fixed assets consists of a write down of fixed assets that are no longer in use by us recorded pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no

corporate restructuring charges for the year ended december  were million or of revenue 
these charges included million relating to employee severance and benefits for terminated employees and  related to existing lease agreements for office space that is no longer in use and other liabilities for which there are contractual obligations 
these charges also included  related to fixed asset impairments recorded pursuant to sfas no 
there were no such charges for the year ended december  interest income  net 
net interest income consists of earnings on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
net interest income decreased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the dollar and percentage decreases were primarily due to lower returns on our invested funds due to the declining interest rate environment experienced in the economy 
net interest income decreased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the dollar decrease in net interest income was due to lower invested balances as a result of cash used and lower returns on our invested funds 
the percentage increase in net interest income was due to decreases in revenue 
given the current interest rate environment relative to that experienced in the prior year  we would anticipate that our interest income in will decrease compared to other income  net 
net other income consists of non recurring miscellaneous income and expense transactions 
during the year ended december    and  we recorded net other income of   and  respectively 
net other income during the years ended december  and consisted primarily of the settlement of certain liabilities that arose in prior years 
impairment of cost basis investment 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded impairment of cost basis investment of  and million  respectively  related to a minority investment in a private company 
cumulative effect on prior years of a change in accounting principle 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
and completed a transitional impairment test for the intangible assets recorded in connection with the purchase of avenue a nyc llc during september upon adoption of sfas no 
 we reclassified all previously recorded intangible assets as goodwill  as those assets  related to workforce and customer base  did not meet the criteria under sfas no 
for separate identification 
furthermore  as a result of the impairment test  we recorded an impairment charge of million that has been recognized as a cumulative effect on prior years of a change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our operating results will continue to be subject to seasonal fluctuations because retail advertisers generally purchase substantially more advertising space during the fourth calendar quarter of each year than during other quarters  particularly the first calendar quarter 
our quarterly and annual revenue  expenses and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
because of these fluctuations  we believe that period to period comparisons are not good indications of our future financial performance 
provision for income taxes as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax reporting purposes of approximately million  and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which  if not utilized  will begin to expire in the internal revenue code contains provisions that limit the use in any future period of net operating loss and credit carryforwards upon the occurrence of specified events  including significant change in ownership interests 
we had deferred tax assets  
table of contents including our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  totaling approximately million as of december  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the entire net deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset balance 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the net proceeds from private sales of equity securities  which raised million through december   and our initial public offering of common stock  which raised million during the first quarter of during the year ended december   we generated million in cash and cash equivalents through our operating  investing and financing activities 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
we have a million equipment term loan facility with a bank  of which million is outstanding as of december  net cash generated in operating activities was million in and net cash used in operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  which related to the net purchase of marketable securities  purchases of computer equipment for general operational purposes  and cash used in the acquisition of i frontier 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  which primarily related to net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities  offset by purchases of computer equipment to expand our ad serving capacity  support research and development activities  and to equip employees hired during that period 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  which was primarily related to the net purchase of marketable securities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in and was primarily related to the repurchase of common stock and payments on our outstanding notes payable offset by the proceeds from option exercises 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  which was primarily related to the payments of notes payable offset by option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in and primarily related to proceeds from sales of securities  including our initial public offering of common stock 
as of december   we had material commitments related to operating leases for office space and office equipment  and notes payable to a bank 
the notes are secured by the equipment purchased with the proceeds from the notes 
in addition  we had material obligations related to the facility leases for our ad serving systems 
the following are our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  commitments operating leases notes payable ad serving system facility leases total commitments in  we entered into an agreement with an entity that will provide sales support to the atlas dmt operating unit 
if the contract is terminated  we will pay a minimum of  the i frontier purchase agreement includes potential contingent payments in and  which are determined by the operating results of our i frontier operating unit for the four years ending december  we estimate that future payments will range from to million 
this estimate will be adjusted based on actual earnings over the four years ending december  our estimates require judgment  based on estimating the future earnings of i frontier 
we cannot assure you that actual future payments will not be materially different than our current estimates 

table of contents in april  we announced that our board of directors had authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to million of our common stock could be repurchased from time to time with available funds 
the primary purpose of the stock repurchase program is to allow us the flexibility to repurchase our common stock to potentially reduce stock dilution and seek to improve our long term earnings per share 
repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  subject to regulatory considerations  and may be discontinued at any time 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately million 
although the stock repurchase program remains in place  we do not currently intend to make a material amount of repurchases  if any  under the present circumstances 
future repurchases  if any  will depend on subsequent developments  corporate needs and market conditions 
if subsequent developments occur or corporate needs and market conditions change that might cause us to make one or more repurchases  we would not necessarily make a public announcement about it at that time 
since our inception  we have significantly increased our operating expenses 
due to the estimated increase in revenue in  we currently anticipate that we will continue to experience some growth in our operating expenses and such expenses will be a material use of our cash resources 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months

in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  addressing how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items  and delivery of any undelivered item is probable 
arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the amount that is not contingent on the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
the final consensus will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  with early adoption permitted 
we do not believe there will be a material financial statement impact upon adoption of eitf issue
