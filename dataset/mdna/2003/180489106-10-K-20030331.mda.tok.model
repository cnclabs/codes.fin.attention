item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview we develop  manufacture and market a versatile automated digital microscope system with the ability to detect  count and classify cells based on color  size and shape to assist pathologists in making critical medical decisions that can affect patient treatment 
the acis automated cellular imaging system combines an automated microscope with computer based color imaging technology 
the fda cleared acis device is currently being used by pathologists and researchers to analyze specimens placed on slides and stained with color producing  commercially available reagents 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
therefore  on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those provisions for bad debts and reserves for acis in progress 
for estimated bad debts  we review on an individual account basis the age of the receivable  all circumstances surrounding the transaction that gave rise to the receivable and whether the customer continues to have the financial resources to pay the receivable as of the balance sheet date and prior to the issuance of the financial statements for the respective period 
for acis in progress  the respective reserve is based upon the expected future use of the acis components based upon proposed design changes  high value components that may be discontinued in the near future and whether there are any lower of cost or market considerations 
for other obligations  where judgment is required  we review the circumstances surrounding the obligation and evaluate the facts and circumstances to determine an appropriate level of accrual for each obligation 
we place most of our instruments with users on a fee per use basis 
we obtain the billing information via modem  which accesses the acis database 
revenue is recognized based on the greater of actual usage fees or the minimum monthly rental fee 
under this pricing model  we will own most of the acis instruments that are engaged in service and  accordingly  all related depreciation and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
for those instruments that are sold  we recognize and defer revenue using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements 
at the outset of the arrangement with the customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of its undelivered elements eg  maintenance and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered in the arrangement eg  software license when the basic criteria in sop have been met 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  typically months 
revenue on product sales is recognized upon acceptance by the customer subsequent to a testing and evaluation period 
some instruments are placed through distributors in europe who are paid commissions based on a percentage of fees paid for use of the system as the fees accrue or as the sales take place 
no such sales took place during year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue fee per use 
revenue increased approximately million or over the comparable period in due primarily to an increase in acis placements 
the number of accounts in the field generating fee per use charges increased from to the average monthly revenue for acis placements and remote viewing stations was approximately  and  respectively  as compared to  and  for the comparable period in our business plan focuses on placing the acis under a lease arrangement in which the customer is charged based on the number of tests performed  subject to a minimum monthly payment 
however  occasional 
table of contents sales of the acis system are made to strategic research institutions 
additionally  we also sell or lease the system on a fixed rent basis in the european community where the fee per use strategy is not accepted in the healthcare structure 
system sales 
revenue from system sales decreased approximately  or over the comparable period in due primarily to fluctuations in the number of units sold 
four systems were sold during as compared to nine for the comparable period in system sales contributed of total revenue for as compared to for the comparable period in the percentage of revenue contributed by system sales should continue to decline as the revenue from fee per use increases 
revenue from system sales can fluctuate significantly principally due to the infrequent and limited number of system sales 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue primarily consists of cost for manufacturing the acis  which includes the cost for direct material  labor costs and manufacturing overhead 
for fee per use revenue the cost of the acis is depreciated over a three year time period and for a system sale the entire cost of the acis system is recognized at the time of sale 
cost of revenue for was approximately million as compared to million for the corresponding period in the increase in cost of revenues was due primarily to the increase in system placements 
the gross margin  as a percentage of total revenue for was as compared to for the comparable period in the gross margin increase is primarily due to the decline in the material costs of our acis system 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
expenses increased approximately  or over the comparable period in the increase is primarily due to the accrual of senior management severance costs  an increase in costs related to our expanded sales force and an increase in sales commission related to our revenue growth 
these increases were offset by a reduction in executive recruiting and relocation costs incurred during we anticipate selling  general and administrative expenses for to increase due to several strategic marketing initiatives targeted to begin during to support our entry into the infectious disease market and our expanded menu of applications 
research and development expenses 
expenses decreased approximately million or over the comparable period in the decline is primarily due to a reduction in personnel and clinical trial costs as we sought to achieve an appropriate level of personnel to support the development of new system capabilities and the continuation of technological advances to the acis 
other income 
other income for the year ended december  decreased approximately  or below the comparable period in due to a decrease in interest earned on our lower cash balance for preferred stock accretion and dividends 
our net loss attributable to common stock for included a charge of million  which consisted of a million charge for a write off of the unamortized discount on the outstanding shares of our series d preferred stock  which were converted into common stock on august   and a million charge for the accretion of dividends on the series d preferred stock 
see note of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
the write off and accretion are non cash charges  and the conversion of all of the outstanding shares of series d preferred eliminates charges for accretion of  and dividends  on the series d preferred stock in subsequent periods 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue fee per use 
revenue increased approximately million or over the comparable period in due primarily to an increase in acis placements and an increase in usage of the acis 
the number of accounts in the field generating fee per use charges increased from to  and average monthly revenue for our full acis accounts increased from  to approximately  per month over the comparable period in system sales 
revenue from system sales increased approximately  or over the comparable period in due primarily to fluctuations in the number of units sold 
nine systems were sold during as compared to four for the comparable period in system sales contributed of total revenue for as compared to for the comparable period in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue for was approximately million as compared to  for the corresponding period in the increase in cost of revenues was due primarily to the increase in system placements 
the gross margin  as a percentage of total revenue for was as compared to for the comparable period in the gross margin increase is primarily due to increase revenue per acis placement and a reduction in the cost of the acis instrumentation 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
expenses increased approximately million or over the comparable period in the increase is primarily due to an increase in staffing costs for both administrative and sales and marketing positions as the company expanded commercial activities 
research and development expenses 
expenses remained comparable to and declined approximately 
other income 
other income for the year ended december  decreased approximately  or below the comparable period in due to a decrease in interest rates and a lower cash balance for the lower cash balance is due to funding of operations 
preferred stock accretion and dividends 
our net loss attributable to common stock for included a charge of million for the accretion of dividends on the series d preferred stock 
the accretion is a non cash charge 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
uncertainties as to future operations the year was our first full year of commercial activity during which we focused primarily on marketing and sales of the acis system as our menu of capabilities performed with the acis expanded and gained commercial acceptance 
although we have experienced consistent and ongoing revenue growth  we still face significant uncertainties  including those discussed below under liquidity and capital resources  our ability to achieve market acceptance of the acis  to manufacture the system in commercial quantities and to continue to achieve satisfactory customer reimbursement from third party payers for tests performed using the acis 
we also face uncertainties with respect to our ability to complete development of additional tests for the acis 
in order to mitigate the risk that any one test will not be successfully developed  we maintain a pipeline of tests in a prioritized queue so that if any one test is not successfully developed  or market feedback suggests that a test should be given a lower priority  we can align development efforts according to priority 
in addition  the acis system is dependent upon the laboratory producing a quality stained slide for image analysis 
reagent and or stain quality issues by stain manufacturers may impact the rate at which the acis technology is adopted or new applications are added to existing placements 
other uncertainties affecting our business include our ability to maintain and develop our relationship with additional remote imaging laboratories and thereby reduce our concentration of risk with a significant customer as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  to collaborate successfully with other companies  universities and research centers to develop  initiate and complete clinical trials of new applications for the acis and obtain governmental approvals for the applications 
lack of success in these efforts could have a material adverse effect on the future results of our operation and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to fund operations 
at december  we had approximately million in stockholders equity 
in order for our common stock to continue to trade on the nasdaq national market  we will have to achieve and maintain a stockholders equity of at least million 
in february  we completed a private placement of million of common stock to safeguard bringing our stockholders equity above million see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses during  which means that we may not be able to maintain the required stockholders equity unless we obtain additional equity financing beyond the million obtained in february if our common stock ceases to be quoted on the nasdaq national market  the trading volume and trading prices of the stock could be adversely affected and that may make it more difficult for us to obtain equity financing in the future 
liquidity and capital resources at december  we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  working capital of approximately million and no long term debt 
cash used in operating activities was million in due primarily to our net loss of million 
cash used in investing activities of million primarily consisted of capital expenditures of approximately million and related primarily to the manufacture of the acis systems placed with customers 
capital expenditures are expected to total approximately million in and are expected to be primarily related to the manufacture of the acis for placement with customers  although our present plans could change and this amount could be materially different 
our business plan anticipates placing these instruments with users and charging a fee per use for each time the instrument is used to perform a test 
the manufacture of these instruments will require a significant outlay of cash for which revenues will be recognized over the lease term 
we intend to fund these expenditures with our current cash resources and with the proceeds from the february private placement and revolving line of credit 
cash provided from financing activities of million was primarily due to our completion of the sale of million of our common stock to safeguard on august  and the conversion and retirement of all of the outstanding shares of the series d preferred stock 
in the transaction entered into on june  and completed on august  safeguard purchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for million and separately acquired  outstanding shares of our series d preferred stock from others which  together with the remaining outstanding shares of series d preferred stock held by others  were converted into  shares of common stock 
the purchase price for the common stock and the conversion price of the series d preferred stock were both per share 
in february we issued  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of million per share in a private placement to safeguard 
safeguard already owned beneficially a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company 

table of contents also in february we announced that we entered into a million revolving credit agreement with the technology and life sciences division of comerica bank california nyse cma 
both the borrowings under the line of credit and the proceeds from the sale of the common stock will be used for working capital purposes 
borrowings under the line of credit will bear interest at comerica s prime rate plus one half percent 
a one time facility fee for the line of credit was also paid to comerica 
the borrowings are guaranteed by safeguard 
chromavision will pay to safeguard a one time fee for the guarantee of  plus an amount equal to of the daily weighted average principal balance outstanding under the line of credit 
existing cash resources  including the proceeds available from the private placement and revolving line of credit completed in february may be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs during our losses from operations and increases in working capital requirements will continue during  but we expect our operating losses in to significantly decrease due to revenue generated from additional system placements 
it is entirely possible  however  that our cash resources will not be sufficient 
to support any such future cash needs  we intend to consider additional debt or equity financing 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funds  we will have to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development activities  clinical studies and or regulatory activities 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  payment due by period contractual obligations total and beyond long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that provide financing  liquidity or market or credit risk support or involve leasing  hedging  research and development services for our business or other similar arrangements that may expose us to liability that is not expressly reflected in the financial statements  except for a facilities and automobile operating lease 
at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such we are not subject to any material financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
new accounting standards not yet adopted in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operations  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
since we have elected not to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
until the adoption date and we are not presently planning any exit or disposal activities for the periods after the adoption date  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the emerging issues task force eitf recently reached a consensus on its tentative conclusions for eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf provides accounting guidance for customer solutions where delivery or performance of products  services and or performance may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
companies are required to adopt this consensus for fiscal periods beginning after june  the company believes the adoption of eitf will not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
in november  fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by 
table of contents a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
fin also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize a liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligation undertaken in issuing a guarantee at the inception of the guarantee 
the provisions of fin relating to liability recognition do not apply to certain obligations such as product warranties and guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified subsequent to december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for interim or annual financial statement periods ending after december  the company adopted the provisions of fin relating to footnote disclosure of warranty obligations on january  the company does not expect the adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas to require prominent disclosures in both interim and annual financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas also amends sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the company will commence quarterly footnote disclosure of the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation beginning in the first quarter ending march  as the company has decided not to voluntarily adopt the sfas fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  the new transition alternatives of sfas will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on january   the fasb issued fasb financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires extensive disclosures including disclosures that are applicable to december  financial statements and will require companies to evaluate variable interest entities created after january  and existing entities to determine whether to apply the interpretation s consolidation approach to them 
companies must apply the interpretation to entities with which they are involved if the entity s equity has specified characteristics 
if it is reasonably possible that a company will have a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity at the date the interpretation s consolidation requirements become effective  the company must disclose the nature  purpose  size and activities of the variable interest entity and the consolidated enterprise s maximum exposure to loss resulting from its involvement with the variable interest entity in all financial statements issued after january  as well as december  financial statements regardless of when the variable interest entity was created 
since the company has no interest in any variable interest entity  the company believes that the adoption of this interpretation will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk historically  we have invested excess cash in short term debt securities that are intended to be held to maturity 
these short term investments typically have various maturity dates which do not exceed one year 
we had no short term investments as of december  two of the main risks associated with these investments are interest rate risk and credit risk 
typically  when interest rates rise  there is a corresponding decline in the market value of debt securities 
fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements because of the short term nature of the securities in which we invest and our intention to hold the 
table of contents securities to maturity 
credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of the debt securities will not be able to make principal and interest payments 
we have limited the investments to investment grade or comparable securities and have not experienced any losses on our investments to date due to credit risk 
changes in foreign exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
however  as our international operations grow  we may enter into such arrangements in the future 
effective january   our foreign sales were denominated in euros 
foreign currency denominated sales have not been significant
