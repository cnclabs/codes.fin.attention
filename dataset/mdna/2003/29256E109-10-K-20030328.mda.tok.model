critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to inventory  accounts receivable  deferred taxes  goodwill  intangible assets and contingencies and litigation 
encore bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
financial reporting release no 
 which was released by the securities and exchange commission  proposes a new requirement that all public companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the critical accounting policies and methods used by the company 
in addition  the securities and exchange commission released financial reporting release no 
 which requires all companies to include a discussion to address  among other things  liquidity  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements inventory reserves the nature of encore s business requires it to maintain sufficient inventory on hand at all times to meet the requirements of its customers 
encore records inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost based upon average actual cost 
encore establishes reserves for such issues as slow moving or excess inventory  product obsolescence and valuation impairment 
encore s inventory reserve policy is primarily based on the products and market practices 
the amount and timing of write downs is determined by division 
for all divisions  encore utilizes a specific identification methodology product rationalization which can occur whenever there is a change in strategy 
in addition  sales performance is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis to determine the amounts that should be added to the existing reserve 
reserves are monitored on a quarterly basis and changes are made as determined by the processes referred to above 
in determining the adequacy of its reserves  at each reporting period encore analyzes the following  among other things current inventory quantities on hand  product acceptance in the marketplace  customer demand  historical sales  forecasted sales  product obsolescence  and technological innovations 
any modifications to encore s estimates of its reserves are reflected in cost of goods sold within the statement of operations during the period in which such modifications are determined by management 
revenue recognition the surgical division s products are sold through a network of independent sales representatives in the us and by distributors outside the us revenues from sales made by independent sales representatives  who are paid commissions upon the ultimate sale of the products  are recorded at the time the product is utilized in a surgical procedure implanted into a patient and a purchase order is received from the hospital 
revenues from sales to customers outside the us are recorded when the product is shipped to the customer 
the distributors  who sell the products to other customers  take title to the products  have no rights of return and assume the risk for credit and obsolescence 
distributors are obligated to pay encore within specified terms regardless of when they sell the products 
in addition  there is no price protection 
the osg division s products are sold to distributors  retail outlets  and various medical and sports establishments 
sales are recorded at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
customers take title to the products  assume credit and product obsolescence risks  must pay within specified periods regardless of when they sell or use the products  and have no price protection except for distributors who participate in our rebate program 
product returns are allowed only with prior approval by encore and a reserve for estimated product returns is maintained based on actual historical experience 
in addition  rebates are granted to distributors and a reserve is maintained for future rebate claims based on actual historical experience 
the reserves for estimated product returns and rebate claims are a deduction from the sales recorded for each reporting period 
the chattanooga group division s products are sold to independent dealers who take title to the products  assume credit and product obsolescence risks  must pay within specified periods regardless of when they sell the products  and have no price protection 
the sales are recorded when the products are shipped to these dealers 
product returns are allowed only with prior approval and a reserve for estimated product returns is maintained based on actual historical experience 
in addition  extended warranty contracts are sold less than of total revenue and the warranty revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the warranty period 
encore must make estimates of potential future product returns and rebates related to current period product revenue 
to do so  management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of encore s products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgment must be used and estimates must be made in connection with establishing the reserves for sales returns  rebates and other allowances in any accounting period 
allowance for doubtful accounts encore must make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivables 
in doing so  management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance in assessing the potential realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon encore attaining future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon management s projections of future taxable income and the periods and manner in which encore s deferred tax assets will be available  management estimates that it is more likely than not that all of encore s deferred tax assets will be available to offset future taxable income 
as such  no valuation allowance has been provided against the deferred tax asset balance at december  goodwill and intangible assets encore must make estimates related to the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination or asset acquisition  as well as the ongoing measurement of the useful life and value of intangible assets and goodwill 
with respect to valuations of intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination or asset acquisition  it is the company s practice to use both internal and external third party evaluations in determining the respective fair values and relative allocations of acquisition cost to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
additionally  on an ongoing basis  the company reviews its intangible assets and goodwill to determine if there has been any change in the useful life of an intangible asset or whether there has been impairment of these assets 
general this section includes a summary of encore s consolidated results of operations  financial condition and where appropriate  factors that management believes may affect future performance

we are a diversified orthopedic company that designs  manufacturers  markets and distributes a comprehensive range of high quality orthopedic devices and related products for the orthopedic industry 
our products are used primarily by orthopedic specialists who treat patients with musculoskeletal conditions resulting from degenerative diseases  deformities  traumatic events and sports related injuries 
we currently market and distribute our products through our three operating divisions  our surgical division  our osg division and the chattanooga group division 
our surgical division offers reconstructive joint products  including hip  knee and shoulder implants  trauma products and spinal implants 
our osg division is a leading provider of orthopedic soft goods that are used to assist the patient in recovering from an injury or a surgical procedure  or to protect against re injury or damage to the surgical site 
the chattanooga group is a leader in the rehabilitation product segment of the orthopedic market 
our three divisions enable us to reach a diverse customer base through multiple distribution channels  providing opportunities for growth across the orthopedic market 
since our formation in april as an orthopedic implant company  our business has grown through a combination of internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
throughout our history  we have placed a strong emphasis on the research and development efforts that have fueled the product pipeline of our surgical division 
we have developed and obtained regulatory approval for over products and product improvements focused on the orthopedic total joint  trauma and spinal segments of the surgical market 
in addition  we have added products through small strategic acquisitions 
more recently  we have completed two significant acquisitions that have allowed us to expand our business into two new product segments of the orthopedic market orthopedic soft goods and rehabilitation equipment both of which complement our surgical division 
these two acquisitions have had the effect of significantly increasing our revenues and should contribute to increasing our operating income  net income and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  when compared to prior periods 
in addition  since these acquisitions were funded through a combination of debt and equity  they had the impact of materially altering our balance sheet 
in july  we purchased the orthopedic soft goods  patient safety devices and pressure care product lines of kimberly clark corporation 
these product lines currently form the basis of our osg division 
these products include the kallassy ankle support  the sports supports product line of braces and supports  the secure all brand of patient safety devices  and the turtle neck and first response safety collars 
see note of the consolidated financial statements acquisitions 
on february   we purchased chattanooga group  inc  a privately held  tennessee based provider of orthopedic rehabilitation equipment 
chattanooga group  inc  which had been in business for over years  originally manufactured and sold the hydrocollator steam pack and has since expanded its product line to include a large variety of rehabilitation and home health products making it capable of providing turn key clinics for orthopedic professionals 
the chattanooga group designs  manufactures and distributes around the world a wide range of rehabilitation products including intelect electrotherapy units  optiflex continuous passive motion devices  triton and adapta therapy tables  along with hydrocollator heating and chilling units 
see note of the consolidated financial statements acquisition of chattanooga group  inc in addition to building critical mass  these acquisitions provided us access to a wide range of distribution partners and allow us the opportunity to cross sell our existing product lines to an expanded customer base 
with the completion of these two acquisitions  we believe we are well positioned to provide a comprehensive range of orthopedic devices and related products to orthopedic specialists operating in a variety of treatment settings 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales were million for the year ended  representing an increase of million  or over the year ended december  the primary reason for this significant increase was sales generated as a result of the february acquisition of chattanooga group  inc the chattanooga group division reported sales of million  representing a increase over its sales levels of million for the comparable period in  which were generated prior to its acquisition by encore 
the chattanooga group division s sales for represented of the company s total annual sales for in the surgical division  overall sales for of million represent a decrease when compared to sales levels of this was due to increases in price and changes in sales mix offset by decreases in volume 
however  in this division  the overall sales decrease masks the improvements made by the surgical division in expanding its domestic sales  where the company has concentrated most of its division sales efforts throughout the increase in domestic sales for the surgical division was when compared to domestic sales levels 
the increase has been most notable in the spine implant area where domestic sales increased over the level of spine product domestic sales for international sales in the surgical division totaled million for  which represents a decrease of when compared to the sales levels for this decrease is primarily a result of a competitor acquiring encore s primary european distributor in the fall of the osg division contributed million in sales for  compared to million for  when only six months of sales were generated as a result of the july acquisition 
gross margin increased by million in to million as compared to million for this increase  like the increase in sales  was largely due to the acquisition of the chattanooga group 
the addition of the chattanooga group accounted for million of the increase 
the osg division and surgical division increased by million and  respectively 
while gross margin grew by absolute dollar amounts  overall gross margin as a percent of sales decreased from to when compared to the surgical division s gross margins as a percent of sales improved for the year from to due primarily to the change in sales mix in favor of domestic sales that yield higher margins 
sales of osg products produced a gross margin of in  compared to in and sales of rehabilitation equipment in the chattanooga group division produced a gross margin of of sales in research and development expenses increased to million for from million in this is an increase of million or over the inclusion of research and development expenses related to the chattanooga group division primarily accounted for this increase 
selling  general  and administrative expenses totaled million for the year  representing an increase of million  or  over expenditures that totaled million 
however  as a percentage of sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to for from in these expenses increased in part due to the acquisitions of the chattanooga group  which incurred million of selling  general  and administrative expenses in  or of the total increase for the year  and the osg division which increased million to million due to the first full year of expenses related to this division 
the remaining increase is primarily attributable to two factors 
first  marketing expenses increased  due to increased activities associated with tradeshows and consulting surgeons 
second  general and administrative expenses increased  due to expanded investor relations activities  higher directors and officers liability insurance  increased strategic planning activities  and higher attorney fees related to the akthea litigation 
unlike when million relating to specific non recurring items was reported  no non recurring charges were incurred during in  these items included  related to a senior management option exchange program   incurred in connection with a legal settlement of a lawsuit brought by a former stockholder in an attempt to stop the issuance of the series a preferred stock and  charged for the cashless exercise of options by a former employee 
the combination of these factors resulted in a million increase in operating income to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the large improvements in operating income were offset by increased interest expense and a high effective tax rate to produce net income of  for the year compared to net income of  for before the impact of the beneficial conversion feature related to series a preferred stock of million 
interest expense increased to million in from million in this increase of million was directly related to additional interest incurred in connection with the chattanooga group division acquisition 
the effective tax rate rose to for the year principally due to the permanent tax differences related to the chattanooga group acquisition compared to the level of pre tax income 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  overall  was a positive year for encore 
the core business of implant sales grew  while the first acquisition  of the osg division  was accomplished 
total sales increased over to million from million due to both increases in volume and increases in price 
implant product sales increased to million or over the prior year 
the company focused on building its domestic sales force and  as a result  domestic implant sales increased with every product line experiencing double digit growth 
particularly strong was the increase in spinal product sales 
agents that were with encore for the entire year showed strong increases over the prior year s sales 
the osg division contributed million or of the total increase 
international sales decreased by  which reflected the fall off of the european distributors as the change from the plus organization sales force to a different set of distributors was instigated 
gross margin increased by million or compared to this increase was due  in part  to there being no additional charges for product rationalization  which in amounted to million 
the osg division contributed million to gross margin and the gross margin for implants increased by million  excluding the additional charge in  or 
gross margin as a percent of sales for without the inventory charge for product rationalization was 
gross margin as a percent of sales declined from in to in due to sales mix  both geographical and product 
gross margin as a percent of sales for implants and soft goods were and respectively  for a consolidated 
research and development expenses decreased by  or  primarily due to the approval of products in late and early  such as the keystone modular hip system and the metal metal acetabular hip system 
the decline is also due to the timing of expenditures for current projects 
current activities include the design of a new revision shoulder  a universal hip stem  and a new total knee system 
clinical studies are continuing on a mobile bearing knee product  a ceramic ceramic acetabular hip system and a ceramic femoral knee component 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million or compared to of this increase  million related to the addition of the osg division 
the remaining portion of the increase was due in part to increased commissions and royalties paid totaling million as a result of higher implant sales 
finally  general and administrative expenses increased  due primarily to increased legal and professional expenses  relocation charges  and salary expenses 
however  as a percent of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to compared to of sales in additional charges of million and million were taken in the second quarter of and the fourth quarter of  respectively  which related to specific items that are not part of the normal selling  general and administrative  or research and development expenses  the components of which are summarized as follows for the year ended december  impairment of intangibles post retirement benefits for former employees provision for doubtful accounts legal settlement charges compensation expense associated with stock option exchange program other total the most significant charge in related to an exchange of certain outstanding options for stock 
approximately million options were cancelled and approximately  shares were issued to the senior management of encore 
the total charge taken for this exchange approximated  the cash impact of which was  the  in legal settlement charges in related to the settlement of the lawsuit brought by one of encore s stockholders in an attempt to stop the issuance of the series a preferred stock 
 of this expense was a cash expense 
finally  there was a  charge for compensation expense associated with a cashless exercise of options by a former employee 
operating income increased from a loss of million to income from operations of million 
prior to the effect of the additional charges in and  as well as the additional inventory reserves of million of identified finished goods million and raw materials  to be written off  income in increased from million in to million in interest expense decreased  in to million as compared to this decrease reflects both lower interest rates on the revolving credit facility of encore and a decreasing amount outstanding on that revolving credit facility 
as a result of the increases in sales  and the lower spending levels  overall  net income for was  as compared to a net loss in of million 
on june   the stockholders of the company approved the issuance of  shares of series a preferred stock at per share for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the  shares of series a preferred stock are immediately convertible into  shares of the company s common stock 
issuance costs associated with the sale of series a stock amounted to  in connection with the issuance of series a preferred stock in june  because the stock is immediately convertible into common stock at the holder s option at a conversion price of per share  which was below the per share closing price of the company s common stock on the date of the issuance of the series a preferred stock  encore recorded a charge to net income available to common stockholders of million representing the fair value of the beneficial conversion feature of the series a preferred stock 
capital expenditures the following table summarizes our capital expenditures during the indicated periods in thousands buildings and leasehold improvements equipment furniture and fixtures surgical instrumentation total we have made significant investments in the surgical implant instrumentation required to implant our surgical products 
the size of our investments in this instrumentation has increased due to the increasing size of our sales force and the expansion of our product lines 
as an incentive for choosing our surgical products  our sales agents often provide surgeons with the usage of necessary surgical implant instrumentation free of charge 
we believe this practice has the net effect of increasing sales of our surgical products 
in the united states  we capitalize and depreciate the surgical implant instrumentation we purchase  whereas the instruments are sold or leased to our international customers 
we have invested in various machine tools in order to increase our manufacturing capacity 
we primarily acquire our machinery through capital leases or acquisitions 
we have devoted significant capital resources to expanding and improving our management information systems through the addition of computer hardware and software  and various other related equipment required to support a growing organization 
additionally  encore acquired million of equipment in connection with the acquisition of the osg division on july  encore has capitalized  in and  in primarily in warehouse equipment  computer equipment and software to set up information systems  network and warehousing capabilities related to the osg division 
encore acquired million in property and equipment related to its acquisition of the chattanooga group 
encore has capitalized  since this acquisition  which is primarily office and plant equipment 
liquidity since inception  encore has financed its operations through the sale of equity securities  borrowings and cash flow from operations 
as of december   encore had borrowed approximately million under the credit facility defined below  with the availability based upon the current borrowing base of approximately an additional million to borrow for working capital and general corporate purposes 
during  operating activities provided cash and cash equivalents of million primarily due to a decrease in inventory and net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization 
this compares favorably to when operating activities provided cash and cash equivalents of million 
encore s continued growth has resulted in an increase in its capital requirements 
this growth has been primarily funded by banking relationships  the credit agreement as defined below  cash generated from operations to meet its working capital needs and the sale of equity 
as of december   encore had net working capital of approximately million 
in june  encore raised million  net of issuance costs of  in connection with the sale of series a preferred stock 
the purpose of raising this money was to fund acquisitions encore had previously announced it was pursuing 
the first of these acquisitions was completed on july   with the purchase from kimberly clark of the product lines that formed the initial offerings of the osg division 
in order to finance the acquisition of chattanooga group  inc  encore and its subsidiaries entered into a new credit agreement the credit agreement dated as of february  with bank of america  national association  as agent  and the lenders signatory thereto  for a maximum borrowing capacity of up to  subject to limitations based upon encore s borrowing base  as defined the senior credit facility  pursuant to the credit agreement 
encore and its subsidiaries executed various security documents in order to secure the financing under the credit agreement  including security agreements  a mortgage  guaranty agreements  a copyright security agreement  patent security agreements  trademark security agreements and various uniform commercial code financing statements 
further  in order to finance the acquisition of chattanooga group  inc  encore and its subsidiaries entered into a note and equity purchase agreement the note agreement dated as of february  with capitalsource finance llc  as agent and purchaser capitalsource  pursuant to which encore sold  in senior subordinated notes the senior subordinated notes to capitalsource 
encore and its subsidiaries executed various security documents in order to secure the financing under the note agreement  including security agreements  a mortgage  guaranty agreements  a copyright security agreement  patent security agreements  trademark security agreements and various uniform commercial code financing statements 
the security interests created by the security documents executed pursuant to the note agreement are junior and subordinate to the security interests created by the security documents executed pursuant to the credit agreement 
in connection with the note agreement  encore granted to an affiliate of capitalsource a warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock of the company the cs warrants 
these debt arrangements contain operating and financial restrictions which may restrict encore s business and financing activities 
these debt agreements restrict encore s ability to i incur additional indebtedness  ii issue redeemable equity interests and preferred equity interests  iii pay dividends or make distributions  repurchase equity interests or make other restricted payments  iv make capital expenditures  v create liens  vi enter into transactions with our affiliates  vii make investments  viii sell assets  or ix enter into mergers or consolidations 
under the note agreement  if encore generates less than certain amounts of adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  for the period commencing march  and ending on march   then encore would have the right  commencing on march  and ending on august   to prepay without penalty up to million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes 
if encore exercises this right  then a pro rata portion of the cs warrants as defined below the conveyed warrants will be conveyed by an affiliate of capitalsource to the galen entities as defined below 
in the event encore does not choose to exercise this right  then three related entities  galen partners iii  lp  galen partners international iii  lp and galen employee fund iii  lp collectively  the galen entities  have agreed to purchase the amount of senior subordinated notes that encore has the right to prepay 
the galen entities beneficially own approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock on an as converted basis as of march  in the event the galen entities purchase any senior subordinated notes from capitalsource  then upon such purchase  a those notes will automatically convert into additional shares of encore s series a preferred stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of i per share or ii times the greater of or the trailing ten day average closing price of the company s common stock on the date of conversion  and b a pro rata portion of the warrants will also be conveyed by capitalsource holdings llc to the galen entities 
as an inducement for the galen entities to enter into the capitalsource galen agreement  encore granted the galen entities options dated as of february  the option to acquire up to that number of shares of encore common stock with a value equal to  at an exercise price equal to the greater of per share or one half of the trailing ten day average closing price of encore s common stock on the date of exercise 
if the galen entities choose to exercise their rights under the option  then any conveyed warrants will automatically be terminated 
conversely  if the galen entities choose to exercise any conveyed warrants  then the option will automatically be terminated 
the option will otherwise automatically terminate on the earlier of i the th day following the date the galen entities are no longer obligated to purchase any senior subordinated notes under the capitalsource galen agreement  ii the date the galen entities acquire any senior subordinated notes or iii august  encore anticipates that it will not generate sufficient amounts of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to avoid having the right to prepay without penalty  aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes 
while encore s current forecast shows that the company will be able to meet the financial covenants during except as otherwise noted above and will be able to keep the need for outstanding debt under the maximum ceilings for amounts outstanding  there is no assurance that the forecasts will prove accurate or that the bank s requirements will be able to be met 
there exists the possibility that encore will need to obtain additional equity financing  although there is no assurance as to the amount  availability or cost of such financing 
in addition to the current restrictions and requirements contained in the current credit arrangements  encore s significant debt level may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities 
encore s high degree of leverage could have negative consequences for it  including the following i the ability to obtain additional financing  if necessary  for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired  or financing may not be available to it on favorable terms  ii encore will need a substantial portion of its cash flow to pay the principal and interest on its indebtedness  including indebtedness that it may incur in the future  iii payments on the encore s indebtedness will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities  iv a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows could make it difficult for encore to meet its debt service requirements and force it to modify its operations  v encore s debt level may make it more vulnerable than its competitors to a downturn in either its business or the economy generally  and vi since some of the debt has a variable rate of interest  it exposes encore to the risk of increased interest rates 
encore is exposed to certain market risk as part of its ongoing business operations 
primary exposure includes changing interest rates 
encore is exposed to interest rate risk in connection with the term loans and borrowings under the credit agreement  which bear interest at floating rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor or the prime rate plus an applicable borrowing margin 
encore manages its interest rate risk by balancing the amount of fixed and variable debt 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value  but do impact future earnings and cash flow  assuming other factors are held constant 
all of the senior credit facility is variable rate debt  although the senior subordinated notes  while having the possibility for interest rate fluctuation  were structured so as to remain at no less than interest and no more than interest 
certain other debt of the company is fixed rate debt 
encore may use derivative financial instruments where appropriate to manage its interest rate risk 
however  as a matter of policy  it does not enter into derivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes 
to date  it has entered into no derivate financial instruments 
historically all of the company s sales have been denominated in us dollars  and therefore the company has not been subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
however  the company has begun to directly distribute its chattanooga group division products in selected foreign markets  and some of these sales of these products in european markets will be denominated in euros  which would cause currency fluctuations to more directly impact our operating results 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   the aggregate amount of annual principal maturities of long term debt excluding capital lease obligations of encore is as follows in thousands year ended december  as of december   encore had entered into purchase commitments for inventory  capital acquisitions  and other services totaling approximately million in the ordinary course of business 
leases the company leases building space  manufacturing facilities and equipment under non cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates 
at december   future minimum lease payments are as follows in thousands capital leases operating leases year ending december  and thereafter total minimum lease payments less amounts representing interest net minimum lease payments less current portion of obligations under capital leases related party transactions on february   encore purchased from an entity related to nick cindrich  our former chairman of the board   shares of common stock of encore 
these shares were purchased at a price approximately equal to the then current trading price of the stock on the nasdaq 
the consideration for these shares was given in the form of a promissory note with an original principal amount of  bearing interest at  payable bi weekly over a three year period

market risk disclosure the company is exposed to certain market risks as part of its ongoing business operations  primarily risks from changing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
primary exposure includes changing interest rates 
encore is exposed to interest rate risk in connection with the term loans and borrowings under the credit agreement  which bear interest at floating rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor or the prime rate plus an applicable borrowing margin 
encore manages its interest rate risk by balancing the amount of fixed and variable debt 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value  but do impact future earnings and cash flow  assuming other factors are held constant 
all of the senior credit facility is variable rate debt  while the senior subordinated notes  while having the possibility for interest rate fluctuation  are structured so as to remain at no less than interest and no more than interest 
certain other debt of the company is fixed rate debt 
encore may use derivative financial instruments where appropriate to manage its interest rate risk 
however  as a matter of policy  it does not enter into derivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes 
to date  it has entered into no derivate financial instruments 
historically all of the company s sales have been denominated in us dollars  and therefore the company has not been subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
however  the company has begun to directly distribute its chattanooga group division products in selected foreign markets  and some of these sales of these products in european markets will be denominated in euros  which would cause currency fluctuations to more directly impact our operating results
