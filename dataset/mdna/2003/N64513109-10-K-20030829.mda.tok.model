overview metron technology nv is a holding company organized under the laws of the netherlands 
through our various operating subsidiaries  we are a leading global provider of marketing  sales  service and support solutions to semiconductor materials and equipment suppliers and semiconductor manufacturers 
we operate in europe  asia and the united states 
we were founded in europe in by our two corporate shareholders  who together owned approximately of our shares as of may   and by certain of our former management 
in  we reorganized metron to combine three asian companies as a reorganization under common control  and purchased transpacific technology corporation ttc and its subsidiaries 
ttc was founded in california in as a semiconductor equipment manufacturers representative company and expanded into the equipment distribution business in in july  we acquired ta kyser co 
kyser in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
founded in  kyser markets and sells materials in nine states within the united states  principally to the semiconductor industry 
in march  we acquired shieldcare ltd  a company incorporated in scotland  in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
shieldcare is an authorized supplier of critical parts cleaning services to major oem and device manufacturing companies worldwide 
the company also operates as an authorized re manufacturer of physical vapor deposition pvd equipment for a well known supplier of automated systems for chemical vapor deposition cvd 
effective november   we completed our acquisition of all the outstanding shares of intec technology s pte 
ltd  a privately held company incorporated in singapore 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase  and the results of operations of intec have been included in our consolidated financial statements from december  intec is a distributor of cleanroom products and a manufacturer of cleanroom garments  and intec sells these products in singapore and malaysia 
in march  we purchased the ag associates rapid thermal processing rtp products from mattson technology 
in may  we acquired certain assets of advanced stainless technologies ast  a small texas based manufacturer of electro polished stainless steel tubing and fittings 
the transaction has been accounted for as a purchase 
in july  we announced a non binding letter of intent with tokyo electron limited tel that outlined the proposed transfer of the eclipse physical vapor deposition line from tel to metron 
we derive our revenue from sales of materials  equipment  service and spare parts to the semiconductor industry  as well as from commissions on sales of equipment and materials 
in general  we recognize revenue for most of an equipment sale and all other product sales upon the shipment of goods to customers 
we defer the portion of our equipment revenue associated with our installation and warranty obligations  and  depending on the terms of the sale  we sometimes also defer a portion of the sales price attributable to the equipment 
we recognize installation revenue  and any deferred equipment revenue  upon technical acceptance of the equipment by the customer s fab personnel  and we amortize the deferred warranty revenue over the applicable warranty period 
we recognize service revenue in the periods the services are rendered to customers 
in each of our three fiscal years ended may   a majority of our revenue came from the sale of products from five or fewer of the semiconductor materials and equipment companies that we represent  who we refer to as our suppliers 
in fiscal  of our total revenue was generated from the sale of products manufactured by fsi  from the sale of products manufactured by entegris and from the sale of products manufactured by cabot microelectronics 
in addition to representing two of our largest sources of revenue  fsi and entegris are also our two largest shareholders  holding and  respectively  of our outstanding shares as of may  although the suppliers that comprise our largest sources of revenue may change from period to period  we expect that revenue from the sale of products of a relatively small number of suppliers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for at least the next five years 
during january  the company and entegris  one of the company s suppliers and shareholders  entered into an agreement to modify their existing distribution relationship 
in february  the company entered into a transition agreement whereby entegris assumed direct sales responsibility for products from its microelectronics group in europe 
in march  the companies entered into a new distribution agreement  under which metron will continue to distribute products from entegris fluid handling group in all regions in europe  asia and parts of the united states covered under the previous distribution agreements 
the new distribution agreement will be in effect until august  as consideration for modifying the distribution agreement  entegris transferred to the company  shares of metron it owned which had a fair market value of million  and made cash payments totaling million over a month period 
the company recorded a total gain of million in other operating income on a straight line basis from february until august revenue from products distributed for the microelectronics group under the previous distribution agreement for the years ended may  and were million and million  respectively 
in august  cabot microelectronics advised the company of its decision to assume the direct distribution of its products in europe and singapore 
the effective date of the transition was june  metron will continue to market cabot microelectronics products in israel 
revenue from the sale of products manufactured by cabot microelectronics excluding israel was approximately million  million and million for the years ended may   and  respectively 
in accordance with the distribution agreement  cabot purchased the remaining inventory at the company s carrying value at june  in october  the company and fsi entered into a transition agreement  providing for the early termination of their distribution agreements in europe and asia 
pursuant to the agreement  effective march  the closing date  fsi assumed direct sales  service and applications support and logistics responsibilities for its surface conditioning and microlithography products in europe and asia  except that the company continued to take purchase orders for spare parts until april  in accordance with the terms of the distribution agreements  and the company will continue to represent fsi products in israel 
the company s revenues for fsi products and services in europe and asia were approximately million  million and million for the years ended may   and  respectively 
in october  under the terms of the transition agreement  fsi advanced million in cash to the company 
on the closing date  the advance was applied toward the repurchase by fsi of inventory and equipment that the company purchased under the current distribution arrangement 
as consideration  fsi agreed to pay to the company an early termination fee of million 
under the terms of the agreement fsi was required to surrender up to  of the company s common shares owned by fsi with a maximum value of million as a form of consideration for the termination fee 
on april   the transition of the distribution agreements with fsi was completed  and the company recorded a total gain of million 
fsi transferred to the company  common shares of the company with a fair market value of million  which is in addition to the million cash advance that the company received in october of as a result  fsi s ownership of the company s outstanding common shares changed from approximately to approximately 
approximately employees who were dedicated to sales  technical service and applications engineering activities related to the distribution of fsi products in europe and asia transferred to fsi 
year ended may  in thousands net revenue europe    asia    united states    total net revenue    year ended may  percentage of net revenue net revenue europe asia united states total net revenue we are organized into two worldwide operating divisions equipment and materials 
our equipment division derives the majority of its revenue from the sale of capital equipment 
the remainder of the division s revenue comes from service  which includes the installation  maintenance and repair of semiconductor equipment  spare part sales and commissions 
with the acquisition of shieldcare  and later of the ag associates rtp products  we added new revenue categories  revenue from the cleaning of shields used in the manufacturing of semiconductors and revenue from the sale of legacy equipment that we manufacture ourselves 
our equipment sales represent products that support various production activities for the manufacture of semiconductors 
the sales of the equipment division principally represent a small number of high dollar value transactions 
in the majority of cases where the equipment is externally sourced  ie is manufactured by one of our suppliers  the equipment is shipped directly to the customer by the manufacturer 
as a result  our equipment sales are significantly affected by the pattern of capital spending by customers  the timing of customer orders  the timing of product shipments by the equipment manufacturer  and the timing of customer acceptances 
our materials division derives the majority of its revenue from sales of materials and components 
the remainder of the division s revenue comes from commissions 
the materials and components we sell are used both in the production of semiconductors and in the building and maintenance of semiconductor equipment and manufacturing facilities 
materials include products such as wafer surface preparation materials  fluid handling components such as fittings  valves and tubing  and disposable cleanroom clothing 
sales of these products tend to be less cyclical than sales of semiconductor equipment and generally offer higher gross margins than externally sourced equipment 
critical accounting policies and estimates metron s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  goodwill and income taxes 
metron bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
together these form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
we have adopted specific and detailed guidelines for recognizing revenue 
nevertheless  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
most equipment sales are recorded as multiple element transactions in which the portion of the sale represented by the fair value of future installation and warranty services is deferred  and only the residual amount of the sale representing the equipment itself is recognized upon shipment to the customer 
in certain circumstances  depending on the terms of the transaction  we also defer the entire transaction or a portion of the residual amount attributable to the equipment itself 
the installation and warranty revenue we defer for each machine sold requires us to estimate the amount of time we expect it to take to install the equipment and to maintain the equipment during the warranty period 
the estimated time is valued using the fair value of our service rates in each country 
we review the adequacy of our estimates periodically and revise them as necessary 
we recognize deferred installation revenue  and deferred equipment revenue  if any  when the customer accepts the equipment as production enabled in the fab 
we recognize deferred warranty revenue ratably over the warranty period 
we continue to expand our capability to manufacture and rebuild certain legacy equipment legend product line as we acquire rights to do so from oems that no longer intend to build the legacy equipment 
revenues from the sale of legacy equipment are recognized upon customer acceptance 
to date  revenues from the sale of legacy equipment have not been significant 
valuation accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the estimate is based on our historical experience and our current assessment of the credit worthiness of specific customers 
the reserves are re evaluated and adjusted at each balance sheet date as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the company analyzes the composition of its inventory and identifies and evaluates slow moving inventory to determine if reserves are required 
estimated required reserves are based on past usage and on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
goodwill 
as a result of some of our business acquisitions  we had as of may   approximately million in goodwill remaining after amortizing million and million of goodwill during fiscal and  respectively 
with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as of june   goodwill was not amortized during fiscal in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an impairment review of our goodwill 
under the transition provisions of sfas  the company performed an assessment to determine if there was an indication that goodwill was impaired as of the date of adoption 
additionally  as a result of the company s restructuring activities and an agreement providing for the early termination of the fsi distribution agreement as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company performed an interim assessment of the carrying value of goodwill during its second quarter ended november  the result of both assessments indicated that the carrying value of the company s goodwill was not impaired 
however  the company s market capitalization share price quoted on nasdaq multiplied by common shares outstanding had been below its net book value nbv since july  and was substantially below nbv throughout the eight month period ended february as a result  the comparison for estimates of the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities to the lower market capitalization indicated that the company s carrying value of goodwill had been completely impaired 
accordingly  the company charged million  the entire carrying value of goodwill  to the company s statement of operations during its third quarter of fiscal income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process may result in the recording of deferred tax assets which represent temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and financial statement amounts reported by each subsidiary  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
at each balance sheet date  we assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on our ability to carryback the temporary differences to recover taxes previously paid  if any  or our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in the relevant tax jurisdiction 
if we determine the recoverability of the deferred tax asset is in doubt  we record a valuation allowance 
we regularly update our estimate of future taxable income in each jurisdiction  and these updates can result in changes in the valuation allowance 
at may   we provided a valuation allowance for all of our deferred tax assets 
results of operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the semiconductor industry began to recover from the slowdown that began in the second half of the recovery continued through fiscal  and we returned to profitability 
however  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to experience order cancellations  delays in booking new orders and delays in shipping orders to customers  all of which contributed to the significant reduction in our revenue in fiscal this directly affected the sales of semiconductor capital equipment and the sales of materials 
as a result of the decline in revenue  we recorded operating losses during the second and third quarters of fiscal while operations were slightly positive in our fourth quarter  we experienced an operating loss for fiscal as a whole 
we believe that  despite short term slowdowns  the semiconductor industry has long term growth opportunities 
as a result  we believed we must maintain our infrastructure  even during periodic slowdowns  in order to continue to serve our customers and to be in a position to take advantage of long term growth opportunities 
consequently  we did not reduce our operating expenses in the first and second quarters of fiscal however  we continued to incur operating losses during fiscal as a result  we announced in october plans to reduce our employees by approximately in addition to the approximately employees we expected to be transferred to fsi as part of the termination of our distribution agreement with fsi 
as of may   we had terminated employees  and  on march   we transferred employees to fsi 
we expect that revenue for the first quarter of fiscal will be less than our revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal the following table summarizes our historical results of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the fiscal years indicated 
the historical financial data for fiscal  and were derived from  and should be read in conjunction with  our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
fiscal year ended may  net revenue cost of revenue gross margin selling  general  administrative and other expenses research  development and engineering restructuring costs goodwill impairment other operating income  net of associated costs operating margin loss the following table shows our materials division and equipment division revenue as a percent of net revenue  together with the related gross margins fiscal year ended may  net revenue equipment division materials division gross margins equipment division materials division net revenue equipment division 
the equipment division s net revenue in fiscal was million  up million or from fiscal while fiscal revenues were slightly improved over fiscal  the continued downturn of the semiconductor capital equipment market sector caused lower revenue levels for the two year period than were achieved during fiscal geographically  during fiscal  equipment revenues in the united states increased by over  which more than offset the revenue decline in both europe and asia 
for fiscal  revenue was million  down million  or  from million in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal we began to experience a severe slowdown  which has continued through fiscal consequently  this resulted in significantly lower division revenues in all geographic regions for fiscal when compared with fiscal our fiscal equipment division revenue was up million  or  from million in fiscal equipment division revenue grew during fiscal in all geographic regions  with particularly strong growth in europe and the united states 
materials division 
in fiscal  the materials division revenue was million  a million or decrease from the million of revenue for fiscal as with the equipment division  the materials division experienced a severe slowdown beginning with our fourth quarter of fiscal  which has continued through fiscal fiscal revenues increased significantly in asia and were slightly higher in the united states  however  revenues in europe continued to decline 
the materials division s net revenue in fiscal was million  down million  or  from million in fiscal despite a sequential increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which were only below the revenues reported in the first quarter  for fiscal as a whole  we experienced significant revenue reductions in all geographic regions  particularly in europe 
the materials division s net revenue in fiscal was up million  or  from million in fiscal gross margins equipment division 
gross margins for fiscal decreased basis points to for the equipment division when compared to fiscal while spare parts and parts cleaning margins improved  lower division margins were primarily caused by higher service costs partly due to the fsi termination agreement and partly as the result of our restructuring activities 
gross margins in asia increased but decreases in europe and the united states contributed to the overall decline 
in fiscal  gross margins increased by basis points 
division margins improved in all revenue categories for fiscal  with the majority of the increase coming from service and spare parts 
service margins improved as a result of the recognition of installation revenues deferred from earlier periods 
commissions also contributed to the margin improvement because they represented a higher proportion of division revenue in fiscal than in fiscal equipment division gross margins for fiscal declined by basis points when compared to fiscal the decline was due primarily to the smaller proportion of sales represented by spare parts revenues in fiscal and to the start up costs of new parts cleaning facilities in israel and singapore 
materials division 
during fiscal  gross margins for the materials division slightly increased by basis points to when compared to fiscal the gross margin growth in materials products were mostly offset with higher warehousing costs and lower material commission revenue 
gross margins in the materials division declined basis points in fiscal while product margins remained essentially flat  warehousing costs increased on a relative basis  which  coupled with a reduction in commission revenue  resulted in lower overall margins 
gross margins in the materials division in fiscal were essentially unchanged from fiscal selling  general  administrative and other sg a expenses 
in fiscal  sg a expenses increased million to million or when compared with fiscal sg a expenses in fiscal were million  down million  or  from fiscal sg a expenses in fiscal were million  up million  or  from fiscal our acquisition of intec accounted for million and million of sg a in fiscal and  respectively 
sg a expenses consist principally of salaries and other employment related costs  occupancy costs  travel and entertainment  communications and computer related expense  trade show and professional services  and depreciation 
in fiscal and  sg a also included the amortization of acquisition goodwill  however  with the adoption of fas on june   goodwill is no longer amortized to the income statement 
our sg a expenses are a function principally of our total headcount 
almost of our operating expenses consist of salaries and other employment related costs 
the increase in sg a expense in fiscal was primarily due to under utilized facilities and personnel costs 
the under utilized facilities were the result of our restructuring program  and were not abandoned until late in our fourth quarter 
in addition  we retained fsi sales and service personnel until the end of our third quarter  in accordance with the terms of the transition agreement for terminating our distribution agreement with fsi 
the decrease in sg a expense in fiscal was due principally to lower personnel expenses amounting to million  which includes incentive plans and bonuses  and lower travel and entertainment expense amounting to million 
in the fourth quarter  we succeeded in substantially reducing the amount of receivables that were over days 
consequently  we reduced our provision for doubtful accounts by million 
the increase in sg a expenses in fiscal was primarily due to increases in headcount  travel and incentive plan expense 
in addition  in fiscal  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of the increase in the level of our accounts receivable  the proportion of our accounts receivable which were not being paid in accordance with agreed terms and the deteriorating short term outlook for the industry 
restructuring costs 
during fiscal  as a result of continuing slow industry conditions  the company announced plans to reduce the number of its employees by approximately in addition to the employees that were transferred to fsi 
the restructure cost of terminating these individuals amounted to million 
additionally  the company incurred approximately million of restructuring costs pertaining to the cost of the abandonment of certain leased facilities within both the equipment and materials segments which expire through the total number of employees terminated during the year was people 
the equipment division reduced its headcount by employees  the materials division terminated employees  and terminated employees were part of finance and administration 
in estimating the accrual for abandoned leased facilities  the company assumed it could sublease the facilities in the future 
these assumptions will be updated periodically and additional adjustments may be required 
restructuring costs of million incurred during fiscal were comprised of termination costs of million and abandonment of a lease amounting to million 
during fiscal  the termination costs pertained to a reduction in headcount totaling employees  of whom worked in the equipment division  in the materials division and in finance and administration 
we expect to incur additional restructuring costs for personnel and facilities during our first quarter of fiscal amounting to approximately million to million 
goodwill impairment 
the company s market capitalization share price quoted on nasdaq multiplied by common shares outstanding has been below net book value nbv since july  and was substantially below nbv for the eight month period ended february  the comparison for estimates of the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities to the lower market capitalization indicated that the company s carrying value of goodwill was fully impaired 
accordingly  the company charged million of goodwill  the entire carrying value  to the company s statement of operations during our third quarter of fiscal other operating income  net of associated costs 
other operating income for fiscal and represented a portion of the total gain of million from the modification of metron s distribution agreement with entegris 
in fiscal  other operating income comprised of million for the remainder of the entegris gain  and a net gain of million that resulted from the early termination of the company s distribution agreement with fsi 
during january  the company and entegris  one of the company s suppliers and shareholders  entered into an agreement to modify their existing distribution relationship 
in february  the company entered into a transition agreement whereby entegris assumed direct sales responsibility for products from its microelectronics group in europe 
in march  the companies entered into a new distribution agreement  under which metron will continue to distribute products from entegris fluid handling group in all regions in europe  asia and parts of the united states covered under the previous distribution agreements 
the new distribution agreement will be in effect until august  as consideration for modifying the distribution agreement  entegris transferred to the company  shares of metron it owned which had a fair market value of million  and made cash payments totaling million over a month period 
the company recorded a total gain of million in other operating income on a straight line basis from february until august in october  the company and fsi  one of the company s suppliers and shareholders  entered into a transition agreement providing for the early termination of their distribution agreements in europe and asia 
pursuant to the agreement  effective march  the closing date  fsi assumed direct sales  service and applications support and logistics responsibilities for its surface conditioning and microlithography products in europe and asia  except that the company continued to take purchase orders for spare parts until april  in accordance with the terms of the distribution agreements  while the company will continue to represent fsi products in israel 
our world wide revenue for fsi products for the year ended may  was of revenues 
our revenues for fsi products and services in europe and asia were approximately million and million and of revenue for the years ended may  and  respectively 
under the terms of the transition agreement  during the second quarter of fiscal  fsi advanced million in cash to the company 
on the closing date  the advance was applied toward the repurchase by fsi of inventory and equipment that the company purchased under the current distribution arrangement 
as consideration  fsi agreed to pay to the company an early termination fee of million 
the agreement required fsi to surrender up to  of the company s common shares owned by fsi with a maximum value of million as a form of consideration for the termination fee

fsi transferred to the company  common shares of the company with a fair market value of million  which is in addition to the million cash advance that the company received in october of as a result  fsi s ownership of the company s outstanding common shares was reduced from approximately to approximately 
employees who were dedicated to sales  technical service and applications engineering activities related to the distribution of fsi products in europe and asia transferred to fsi 
equity in net income loss of joint ventures 
during fiscal and  we incurred losses from both of our equity interests in our joint venture investments with metron atkins partnership limited map and ast 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company acquired certain assets of ast 
accordingly  the fiscal income pertains to our share of map s net income 
loss from impairment of investment 
during fiscal  we recorded a loss of million for an estimated other than temporary impairment in the value of our investments in ast and abeto gmbh abeto 
million of the loss was recorded against our equity investment in ast 
the remainder of the loss pertained to abeto  an investment we made in may abeto was established in september as a spin off from infineon technologies ag to provide outsource services in the reclaim and refurbishment of packaging materials for the semiconductor industry 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we assessed abeto s ability to continue as a going concern without additional financial support  and in the fourth quarter  as a result of our assessment  we recorded an impairment loss of million 
other expense  net 
the following table summarizes the components of other income expense 
year ended may  in thousands foreign exchange loss interest income interest expense    other income other expense  net  we engage in limited hedging activities to reduce our exposure to exchange risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency  but because hedging activities can be costly  we do not attempt to cover all potential foreign currency exposures 
during the three year period ended may   we entered into contracts to hedge firm purchase commitments  to hedge the maturities of foreign currency denominated liabilities with foreign currency denominated assets and to hedge differences existing between foreign currency assets and liabilities 
the currencies in which we purchase forward exchange contracts have numerous market makers to provide ample depth and liquidity for our hedging activities 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we had an exchange loss of  which was primarily the result of the sudden and significant appreciation of the euro against the united states dollar in december during fiscal  approximately  of the foreign exchange loss pertained to the cost of hedging the israel shekel 
the higher cost was primarily due to the difference in the interest rates between the united states dollar and israel shekel 
interest income represents primarily earnings on our available cash balances 
the decrease in our interest income in fiscal years and is a result of lower average cash balances and of declining interest rates 
interest income for fiscal was primarily from the short term investment of our initial public offering proceeds that remained after the utilization for acquisitions and capital expenditures 
interest expense represents the interest costs for our borrowing facilities and long term debt 
interest expense in fiscal represented a higher borrowing base to support working capital requirements associated with higher revenues 
the decrease of interest expense in fiscal was primarily due to lower amount available from our credit facilities  and lower interest rates 
the reduction of interest expense in fiscal results primarily from lower utilization of the credit facilities 
other income for fiscal  and consisted of various miscellaneous non operating income 
provision for income taxes 
in fiscal  our effective income tax rate was 
we established a valuation allowance for all the deferred tax assets during fiscal  due to the uncertainty of our ability to generate sufficient taxable income to realize net deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  our effective income tax rate was a benefit of 
the effective rate was lower than the netherlands statutory tax rate of  primarily because of non deductible losses in asia  and tax losses in asia for which we recorded a valuation allowance  which eliminates any benefit to our effective tax rate 
in fiscal  our effective income rate was 
the effective rate was higher than the netherlands statutory tax rate of  primarily because of higher tax rates in countries other than the netherlands where we do business and non deductible losses in asia 
liquidity and capital resources we define liquidity as our ability to generate resources to pay our current obligations and to finance our growth during periods of business expansion 
our principal requirement for capital is for working capital to finance receivables and inventories  and to a lesser extent to fund major capital expenditures such as parts cleaning facilities 
for the past three fiscal years  our principal sources of liquidity were cash flow from operations and bank borrowings 
our working capital  current assets less current liabilities  at may  was million  compared to million at may  our current ratio  current assets divided by current liabilities  was at both may  and operating activities 
cash flows generated by operating activities in fiscal were million  which represents a million decline from fiscal our net loss plus non cash items included in net loss totaled million  a decrease of million from fiscal changes in assets and liabilities due to a decrease in receivables  the reduction of inventories  partially offset by the reductions in payables and deferred revenue generated million in cash  which offset the net loss plus non cash items 
cash flows generated by operating activities in fiscal were million  which represents a million decline from fiscal our net loss plus non cash items included in net loss totaled million in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal changes in assets and liabilities due to a substantial decrease in receivables  the reduction of inventories  partially offset by the reductions in payables generated million in cash 
the cash generated by changes in assets and liabilities more than offset the net loss plus non cash items 
cash flows generated by operating activities in fiscal were million  which represents a million improvement from fiscal net income plus non cash items included in net income totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal changes in assets and liabilities absorbed million in fiscal  changes in receivables and inventories offset by increases in payables absorbed million  reflecting higher sales in fiscal and the fact that our customers generally did not pay us as promptly as we are required to pay our suppliers 
investing activities 
our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment totaled million for fiscal  down from million for the same period in fiscal we spent approximately million on our new operations management information system  million purchased additional computer equipment  while the remaining amounts bought furniture  fixtures  and leasehold improvements 
we estimate that our total capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million  of which million pertains to our new operations management information system 
to date  we have invested million in the new system  and we estimate the total cost will be to million over the next months 
our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment totaled million for fiscal  up from million for the same period in fiscal we spent approximately million in fiscal to build our new parts cleaning facilities in singapore and israel  and we invested million in our new operations management information system 
we invested million for an approximately interest in ast 
financing activities 
equity 
during fiscal years  and  we received million  million  and million  respectively from employees for the purchase of approximately   and  common shares through our employee stock purchase plan  and approximately   and  common shares from the exercise of stock options 
debt 
for fiscal  we paid down million of the amounts we had borrowed on our credit facilities 
in fiscal  we increased our long term debt by million in exchange for the assets acquired from ast 
in fiscal  we increased our credit facilities to keep pace with increased revenues  and increased our short term borrowings by million 
current and future position 
as of may   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term borrowings under our various lines of credit 
we believe that our available cash resources  which comprise cash and cash equivalents including the net proceeds from our august issuance of million of convertible debentures due  amounts available under our credit facilities giving effect to the july renewal of our million royal bank of scotland facility and the august reduction in availability under our compass bank facility to million as discussed below and anticipated cash from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through fiscal however  if our revenues are lower or our expenses are higher than anticipated  or if inventory  accounts receivable or other assets require a greater use of cash than anticipated  our available cash resources  including amounts available under our credit facilities  may not be sufficient for our cash requirements 
further  existing and potential customers and vendors may take actions that could harm our liquidity position if they believe that our cash balances are not adequate 
in addition  if revenues increase materially  we may need to raise additional cash resources from external sources to permit us to conduct our operations in the ordinary course of business through fiscal we also intend to seek additional financing during fiscal to meet our anticipated cash requirements for fiscal and beyond 
certain of our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to meet and maintain certain financial tests 
at may   we were in violation of covenants under our compass bank facility  for which we obtained a waiver 
in august  compass bank agreed to extend the facility with a reduced availability of million through mid november as part of this extension  compass bank modified the covenants of which we were in violation  and we made a payment of million to compass bank from the proceeds of our august issuance of million principal amount of convertible debentures due unless compass bank agrees to a further extension of the facility  the outstanding balance of the facility must be repaid in mid november we intend to pursue discussions with alternative lenders to replace the compass bank facility prior to mid november however  while we believe that we will be able to enter into a credit facility with another lender to replace the compass bank facility and that we will have sufficient cash resources to repay the compass bank facility when due if necessary  we cannot assure you that the compass bank facility or an alternative credit facility will be available to us after mid november on favorable terms  or at all 
we intend to pursue discussions with our lenders to further waive  modify or  possibly  eliminate  certain financial covenants in our credit facilities and to pursue discussions with additional lenders that may not require such financial covenants 
however  we cannot give any assurance that the lenders will agree to modify or eliminate such covenants or that we will be able to enter into arrangements with additional or alternative lenders that do not require such covenants 
while we anticipate that we will be able to comply with covenants in our credit facilities  we cannot give any assurance that we can comply with the covenants of our existing credit facilities 
a breach of a covenant in a credit facility could result in the lender demanding repayment of all or part of our indebtedness  could impair our ability to obtain additional access to our current or alternate credit facilities and could result in a cross default under our convertible debentures 
while we believe that our current lines of credit other than the compass bank facility will continue to be available to us through fiscal  all of our lines of credit are payable on demand or subject to periodic  generally annual  review 
given recent developments in our business and industry  we cannot give any assurance that our lenders will agree to continue to make our credit facilities available to us  or that new lenders will agree to make credit facilities available to us  on terms or in amounts acceptable to us  or at all 
any failure to retain our existing credit facilities or enter into replacement facilities may impair our ability to fund our current operations and achieve our longer term business objectives 
if our significant credit facility lenders demand repayment of all or a significant portion of our indebtedness after the end of fiscal  we may not have the cash resources necessary to repay such indebtedness when due 
we cannot give any assurance that financing will be available when needed on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
if we determine that we need to issue additional equity securities or debt securities convertible into equity to address our need for cash resources  the issuance of additional equity securities or debt securities convertible into equity is likely to result in significant dilution to our existing shareholders  and the new equity securities or debt securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our existing common shares 
it may be necessary to raise additional funds through strategic transactions  in which event we may cease conducting or relinquish rights to a portion of our current business 
strategic transactions may not be available on terms that are favorable to us from a longer term perspective 
in addition to our intent to raise capital to fund our operations  we may need to raise additional capital through public or private sales of equity and or additional borrowings for significant acquisitions  significant capital expenditures or other extraordinary transactions 
if we cannot raise additional funds  if needed  on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop our business  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  all of which could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
in addition to the liquidity issues associated with our need for capital from external sources  our ability to generate our anticipated cash flow from operations is subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed under part i risks related to metron 
these risks include  in particular  our dependence upon a few key suppliers and a relatively small number of customers for a majority of our revenue  variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our products and collect accounts receivable and in the timing of customer orders and risks associated with the semiconductor industry and its periodic downturns 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources are expected to be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement 
this statement involves known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our  or our industry s  actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
these factors are discussed under part i item  business risk factors risks related to metron and elsewhere in this report on form k

in july  an officer managing director of metron entered into a tax indemnification agreement tia with the company as part of its acquisition of transpacific technology corporation 
at the time of the acquisition and until it completed its initial public offering in november  metron was a controlled foreign corporation under subpart f of the us internal revenue code subpart f  and as a us person the officer director was liable for personal income tax on income imputed to him under subpart f 
under the agreement  the company has provided cash advances for taxes due for subpart f income that totaled million 
under the tia  the officer managing director is required to repay these advances only to the extent that he benefits from the increase in the tax basis of his holding of metron stock 
accordingly  in fiscal  the company recorded a reserve of million against these advances 
repayment of a portion of the advances is required beginning with the first sale of shares owned by the officer director 
in conjunction with the acquisition of kyser  we assumed a note from a shareholder for the purchase of retired treasury shares

while most of our international sales are denominated in united states dollars  some are denominated in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that our sales and operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
owing to the number of currencies involved  the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  and our constantly changing currency exposures  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
although we engage in foreign currency hedging transactions from time to time  these hedging transactions can be costly  and therefore  we do not attempt to cover all potential foreign currency exposures 
these hedging techniques do not eliminate all of the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on anticipated revenue
