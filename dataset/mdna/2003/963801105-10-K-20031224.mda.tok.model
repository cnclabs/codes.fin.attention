item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we design  develop and manufacture innovative microelectronic and display components and systems for inclusion in high technology products used in the military  industrial  and commercial markets 
our microelectronic solutions include advanced semiconductor and state of the art multi chip packaging  as well as our proprietary process for applying anti tamper protection to mission critical semiconductor components in military applications 
our display solutions include enhanced flat panel display products  interface devices and electromechanical assemblies 
our customers  which include military prime contractors in the united states and europe as well as commercial oems  outsource many of their microelectronic and display components and systems to us as a result of the combination of our design  development and manufacturing expertise 
we were formed as a result of the merger between bowmar and edi in october at the time of the merger  bowmar was a manufacturer of high reliability electronic components and interface and mechanical devices  mainly for military applications 
edi was a manufacturer of commercial memory products for the telecommunications and networking markets and also had a small ruggedized display business serving the military and industrial markets 
this merger provided us with a diversified platform to expand our product offerings within both the military and commercial markets 
in order to complement our military industrial display business  we acquired panelview  a designer and manufacturer of enhanced commercial flat panel display products  in january following the acquisition  we consolidated our display operations into our panelview subsidiary 
in january  we acquired interface data systems  inc ids  a designer and manufacturer of membrane keypads  flexible circuits  sensors  control panels  and handheld and desktop electronic devices 
this acquisition allowed us to expand our interface device product offerings and enhance our subsystem solutions 
in addition  with ids s design and manufacturing capabilities we can now offer fully integrated system level solutions 
our product and market diversification as well as our broad customer base have allowed us to maintain relative sales stability and profitability during the recent economic downturn 
gross margins for sales of military industrial products average approximately while gross margins for sales of commercial products traditionally average approximately 
the following table shows our historical net sales by our two business segments and the markets they serve in thousands 
table of contents microelectronic segment military industrial market commercial market display segment military industrial market commercial market total microelectronic segment military industrial market commercial market display segment military industrial market commercial market total for the year ended september   ids contributed approximately million of net sales to the commercial market of our microelectronic segment and approximately million of net sales to the commercial market of our display segment 
the foregoing information includes ids s net sales from the date of acquisition on january  restatement of interim consolidated financial statements as a result of a change in the way we do business with a reseller that began in  we determined that revenue relating to shipments to that reseller should be recognized at the time the reseller sells the product to its end customers rather than at the time the goods are shipped to the reseller 
as a consequence  we plan to restate our unaudited interim financial information for each of the first three quarters of fiscal to reflect the effects of this change 
the impact of this change on our previously reported unaudited operating results for each of the first three quarters of fiscal and for the nine months ended june  is as follows in thousands  except per share data 
table of contents st quarter nd quarter rd quarter nine months net sales as originally reported restatement adjustments as restated gross profit as originally reported restatement adjustments as restated net income as originally reported restatement adjustments as restated basic earnings per share as originally reported restatement adjustments as restated the restatement adjustments resulted in the deferral of  of net sales and  of related gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal of those amounts   of net sales and  of related gross profit were recognized during the fourth quarter of when the reseller sold the related products through to its end customers 
the net impact of the restatement was a reduction of our net income for fiscal of  as of september   we had deferred net sales of  and related gross profit of  on sales to the reseller and we expect to recognize such amounts in operating results during the first six months of fiscal when the related products are sold by the reseller to its end customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include the following items the company sells its microelectronic and display products primarily to military prime contractors and commercial original equipment manufacturers 
a small portion of the company s products are also sold through distributors or resellers 
the company recognizes revenue on product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer exists  title to the product has passed to the customer  which usually occurs at time of shipment  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the related billing is reasonably assured 
advance payments from customers are deferred and recognized when the related products are shipped 
revenue relating to products sold to distributors or resellers who either have return rights or where the company has a history of accepting product returns are deferred and recognized when the distributor or reseller sells the product to the end customer 
the company also provides limited design services pursuant to related customer purchase orders and recognizes the associated revenue as such services are performed 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover potential credit losses relating to its trade accounts receivable 
the allowance is based on the company s historical collection experience 
table of contents as well as an analysis of specific past due accounts 
write offs against the allowance totaled approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal historically  we have experienced fluctuations in the demand for our products based on cyclical fluctuations in the microelectronic and display markets 
these fluctuations may cause inventory on hand to lose value or become obsolete 
in order to present the appropriate inventory value on our financial statements  we identify slow moving or obsolete inventories and record provisions to write down such inventories to net realizable value 
these provisions are based on management s comparison of the value of inventory on hand against expected future sales 
if future sales are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory provisions may be required 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we make these estimates based on an analysis of accounts receivable using available information on our customers financial status and payment histories 
historically  bad debt losses have not differed materially from our estimates 
we maintain a pension plan for eligible union employees at our fort wayne  indiana facility 
to account for the cost of this plan  we make estimates concerning the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and discount rates to be used to calculate future benefit obligations 
changes in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets affect the amount of investment income expected to be earned in the future 
we base our related estimates using historical data on the rate of return from equities and fixed income investments  as well as projections for future returns on such investments 
if the actual returns on plan assets do not equal the estimated amounts  we may have to fund future benefit obligations with additional contributions to the plan 
changes in the discount rate affect the value of the plan s future benefit obligations 
a lower discount rate increases the liabilities of the plan because it raises the value of future benefit obligations 
this will also cause an increase in pension expense recognized 
we use published bond yields to estimate the discount rate used for calculating the value of future benefit obligations 
we adopted the provisions of sfas as of september  and discontinued amortization of goodwill at that time 
we also identified our reporting units  allocated our assets and liabilities to such reporting units and completed the first step impairment test for goodwill relating to our panelview reporting unit 
the fair value of the panelview reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model with a long term growth rate of  and a discount rate of 
the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value  therefore  an impairment of goodwill was not indicated 
at september   we completed the first step of our impairment tests for goodwill relating to both the panelview and ids reporting units 
the fair value of the reporting units was determined using a discounted cash flow model with a long term growth rate of for each reporting unit  and discount rates of and  respectively 
the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values  therefore  goodwill impairment was not indicated 
if our actual cash flows for these reporting units are less than projected  the related goodwill may become impaired and a related impairment charge will be required 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are recognized  net of any valuation allowance  for deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of goodwill amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses operating income interest expense interest income income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales net sales were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended september  net sales for the year ended september  included million from ids 
military industrial sales in the microelectronic segment were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  the growth in sales was mainly attributable to increased sales of our ball grid array memory products and microprocessor products 
we expect sales of these products to increase further in commercial sales in the microelectronic segment were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or approximately from million for the year ended september  commercial sales in the microelectronic segment for the year ended september  included million from ids  which offset a million decrease in sales to the telecommunication and data communication markets 
military industrial sales in the display segment were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  the decrease was due to our decision to focus our resources on our commercial display sales and to not pursue military related orders that required a disproportionate amount of our engineering resources when compared to the amount of the order 
we will pursue military related orders when the order meets our requirements 
commercial sales in the display segment were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of million of net sales 
table of contents from ids  and an increase of million of net sales of commercial display products from our panelview division mainly from sales of products into new markets  such as automotive test equipment 
approximately million  or  of net sales for our display segment came from garmin international  inc  while general electric medical division  accounted for approximately million  or  of display segment sales 
we expect that our sales to garmin and general electric will decline significantly during the first quarter of fiscal due to a shift in their manufacturing strategies 
northrup grumman accounted for approximately million or  of our microelectronic segment sales 
no other customer accounted for more than of segment or total net sales for this period 
the majority of our sales are not subject to seasonal fluctuations over the course of a year 
sales of our membrane keypad products  which totaled approximately million in fiscal year  are subject to seasonal fluctuations relating to home appliance sales in the spring and fall 
gross profit gross profit was million for the year ended september   an increase of million or approximately from million for the year ended september  for the year ended september   ids contributed million in gross profit 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately for the year ended september   compared to approximately for the year ended september  gross profit for the microelectronic segment was million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  the majority of the increase in gross profit came from an increase in military industrial sales in the microelectronic segment 
gross margin as a percentage of microelectronic segment sales was approximately for the year ended september   compared to approximately for the year ended september  the product mix in the microelectronic segment shifted to a greater number of military products  which have a higher selling price and higher gross margin than commercial products 
gross profit for the microelectronic segment for the year ended september  included approximately million from ids 
during fiscal  approximately million of our commercial microelectronic inventory was written off against the related inventory reserve 
also  approximately million of additional commercial inventory was identified as slow moving and a corresponding charge was recorded 
sales of inventory which had previously been written down were insignificant 
gross profit for the display segment was million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  gross profit for the display segment for the year ended september  included approximately million from ids 
gross margin as a percentage of display segment sales was approximately for the year ended september   compared to approximately for the year ended september  gross profits in included the reversal of million of accrued costs relating to a completed customer order 
sales of inventory which had previously been written down were insignificant 
we anticipate that gross margins in our display segment  after the inclusion of ids  will decrease slightly in fiscal as ids sells primarily into commercial markets 
ids s gross margins have historically been consistent with our commercial gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation expense  selling expenses  including commissions  information technology expenses and corporate administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  this increase was due to a million increase in general and administrative expenses  and an increase in selling expenses of million over the comparable period mainly because of higher commission and payroll expenses  and the inclusion of ids 
selling  
table of contents general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to approximately for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  ids contributed approximately million of general and administrative expenses and approximately million of selling expenses for the year ended september  accounting for million of the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year 
ids selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales have historically been consistent with our selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a result  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales to remain consistent 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation for our engineering personnel  consulting expenses and project materials 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  this increase was attributable to increases of million in the microelectronic segment and million in the display segment 
the year ended september   included million of research and development expenses for ids 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses have remained consistent and average approximately of net sales 
we are committed to research and development of new and existing products and expect research and development expenses to remain at approximately the same percentage of net sales in the future 
ongoing product development projects for the microelectronic segment include new packaging designs for memory products including synchronous dynamic random access memory sdram  and synchronous static random access memory ssram  along with microprocessor modules and ball grid array products  continuing development of anti tamper technology for microelectronic products  and qualification of new semiconductor products 
ongoing product development projects for the display segment include glass lamination process technology and display systems development 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest expense on our long term debt 
interest expense was  for the year ended september   a decrease of  from  for the year ended september  interest expense for the year ended september  related to amounts outstanding on our term loan  which was paid off during fiscal year interest expense for the year ended september  related to our assumption of approximately million of debt in connection with the acquisition of ids 
we paid off the ids debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest income interest income consists of interest earned on our cash balances in various types of interest bearing accounts  and interest earned on investments in short term marketable securities 
interest income was  for the year ended september   an increase of  compared to  for the year ended september  this increase was attributable to the increase in cash equivalents between periods primarily as a result of the reinvestment of cash flows from operations  and the proceeds received from our stock offering which was completed in july amortization of goodwill and intangible assets we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  on september   and discontinued amortization of goodwill at that time 
goodwill amortization for the year ended september  totaled million 
intangible asset amortization for the year ended september  totaled million  of which approximately million related to intangible assets acquired from ids 

table of contents income taxes income tax expense consists of current and deferred federal and state income taxes 
income tax expense was million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september  the effective tax rate was approximately for the year ended september   compared to approximately for the year ended september  the increase in the effective tax rate in was a result of million of income tax benefits in relating to the reversal of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as we believed it was more likely than not that we would realize the related tax benefits  as well as the reversal of an income tax reserve as a result of the completion of certain prior years tax returns 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales net sales were million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for fiscal year military industrial sales in the microelectronic segment were million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or approximately  from million for fiscal year sales of products with our newly developed anti tamper technology totaled approximately million in fiscal year  while fiscal year did not have any such sales  as this process technology was still under development 
the increase in military industrial sales was also attributable to a higher volume of high density  multi chip packages used in domestic and international defense and avionics applications 
commercial sales in the microelectronic segment were million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for fiscal year the decrease was directly related to the decline in the telecommunications and data communications markets  which began in the third quarter of fiscal year cisco systems and lucent technologies  customers that accounted for approximately of microelectronic segment sales during fiscal year  accounted for less than of sales for the microelectronic segment in fiscal year the sales to cisco systems and lucent technologies in fiscal year occurred during the first two quarters of that year and were based on orders booked in fiscal year the decline from these two customers accounted for half of the million decrease in commercial microelectronic sales over the comparable periods  while the remaining decrease was attributable to lower purchases by other telecommunications and data communications customers 
military industrial sales in the display segment were million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for fiscal year this decrease was due to our decision to focus our resources on our commercial display sales 
commercial sales in the display segment were million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or approximately  from million for fiscal year the majority of the increase of commercial display sales was attributable to an increase of million in sales to general electric medical division and garmin international  resulting from the introduction of new medical and global positioning system products 
sales to other customers increased by approximately million because of the inclusion of panelview sales for twelve months in fiscal as compared to eight months in the previous year 

table of contents gross profit gross profit was million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or approximately  from million for fiscal year gross margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately for fiscal year  compared to approximately for fiscal year gross profit for the microelectronic segment was million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or approximately  from million for fiscal year gross margin as a percentage of microelectronic segment sales was approximately for fiscal year  compared to approximately for fiscal year this increase was due to an increase in military industrial sales and a significant decrease in the commercial sales 
military products had significantly higher average selling prices and gross margins than commercial products 
during fiscal year  based on severe declines in the telecommunications industry  we identified million of commercial inventory within our microelectronic segment that did not have a forecasted demand for usage 
we provided a reserve of million against this inventory in fiscal year based on our estimates of the parts most likely to go unused 
in addition  million of raw materials and finished goods inventory was written off because of poor yields or obsolescence 
these inventory charges of approximately million represented of net sales for fiscal year during fiscal year  approximately million of the inventory identified in fiscal year was written off against the reserve 
the amount of inventory in this excess category gradually decreased to approximately million as of september  from the originally identified million 
during this time  we completed quarterly inventory reviews and determined that a reserve of approximately million was still needed to account for possible inventory obsolescence of these remaining parts because of their age and lack of usage 
also during this period  million of finished goods items were identified as slow moving and a corresponding reserve was provided 
these additional items required us to maintain a million reserve for raw materials and finished goods relating to our commercial microelectronic products 
in fiscal year  these activities did not have a material impact on our gross margins and operating results 
gross profit for the display segment was million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or approximately  from million for fiscal year gross margin as a percentage of display segment sales was approximately for fiscal year  compared to approximately for fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to significantly higher commercial display sales over the comparable period  which have a lower gross margin than military industrial display sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for fiscal year this decrease was attributable to decreased selling expenses in the microelectronic segment of million due to lower commission expense on lower net sales  a reduction of administrative personnel  and a reduction in spending 
this decrease was offset by an increase of million in display segment selling expenses  which was attributable to higher commission expense and an increase of sales personnel 
total commission expense was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for fiscal year research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for fiscal year research and development expenses were approximately of net sales for fiscal year  compared to approximately of net sales for fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to fewer commercial products under development in the microelectronic segment 
during fiscal year  we began development on anti tamper technology for certain microelectronic devices in the military industrial market 
the anti tamper technology development was completed by the end of fiscal year  and the process went into production at the start of fiscal year therefore  fiscal year included million of product development expenses for anti tamper technology 

table of contents display segment research and development expenses were million for fiscal year  as compared to million for fiscal year this increase was a result of a number of new engineers hired during the last part of fiscal year to expand display coating and enhancement technologies 
interest expense interest expense was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for fiscal year interest expense during fiscal year was incurred on our line of credit and a term loan 
the line of credit was paid off during the third quarter of fiscal year and was not used during fiscal year the term loan was paid off during the second quarter of fiscal year two additional loans totaling million were obtained for the purchase of equipment during the second quarter of fiscal year both loans were paid off during the fiscal year ended september interest income interest income was million for fiscal year  compared to  for fiscal year this increase was attributable to the reinvestment of cash flows from operations in an interest bearing money market account after we paid off our line of credit during the third quarter of fiscal year amortization of goodwill and intangible assets amortization expense was million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or approximately  from million for fiscal year fiscal year included eight months of goodwill amortization relating to the panelview acquisition  while fiscal year included months of such amortization 
income taxes during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we reversed a deferred tax valuation allowance of approximately million relating to our net operating loss carry forwards  as we believed it was more likely than not that we would realize the related tax benefits 
we also reversed approximately million of tax reserves that had been recorded in previous years as a result of the completion of certain prior years tax returns 
an additional million tax benefit was also recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to recognize the extra territorial exclusion deduction applicable to foreign sales of that fiscal year 
in total  a tax benefit of approximately million was recorded during the quarter ended september   reducing our effective rate to for the year 
liquidity and capital resources cash on hand as of september  totaled approximately million  while marketable securities consisting of a short term corporate note totaled approximately million 
the short term corporate note was purchased with a portion of the proceeds from our public stock offering in july during fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
depreciation and amortization totaled approximately million for the year 
purchase of property  plant and equipment for the year ended september   totaled approximately million 
approximately million was spent on production equipment for our microelectronic manufacturing facilities 
in addition  approximately million was spent on production equipment for our display and interface products manufacturing facilities 
accounts receivable increased approximately million from fiscal year  including approximately million of ids accounts receivable 
days sales outstanding at september  was days  slightly higher than the days at september   due to some of our customers taking longer to pay in fiscal year than in fiscal year inventories increased approximately million from fiscal year  including approximately million of ids inventories 
inventory of approximately million as of september  represents days of inventory on hand  a slight decrease from days on hand at september  inventory levels are based on projected production requirements for the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents accounts payable as of september   were approximately million higher than at the end of fiscal this increase includes approximately million of ids accounts payable 
accrued expenses as of september   were approximately the same as the end of fiscal  and included approximately million of ids accrued expenses 
excluding the impact of ids  the decrease in accrued expenses was mainly due to a million lower income tax payable than last year 
deferred revenue at september  was approximately million  and consisted of approximately million of advance payments from customers  and approximately million of revenue relating to inventory held at a reseller 
we maintain a pension plan for eligible union employees at our fort wayne  indiana facility pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement 
mainly because of a lower discount rate used to value expected future benefit obligations  the pension plan is currently under funded by approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we expect to fund our pension obligation through expected returns on plan assets and company contributions to the plan over the next several years 
actual contributions will be dependent on the actual investment returns during that period 
during fiscal  we contributed million to the plan 
we believe that funding the plan over the next several years will not significantly impact our liquidity 
we have a million revolving line of credit with bank one 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at either the london interbank offered rate libor plus  or the bank one prime rate 
the line of credit matures on march  and we do not anticipate any difficulties in renewing the line of credit at that time 
we borrowed approximately million on the line of credit in the second quarter of fiscal year to pay off debt assumed from our acquisition of ids 
the funds were drawn temporarily on the credit line until a term loan was obtained 
we obtained a term loan in the amount of million on march  from bank one  which we used to repay borrowings on the line of credit 
the term loan bears interest at libor plus and matures in march as of the end of september  there were no borrowings against the line of credit 
we raised approximately million from the sale of million shares of our common stock through a public offering that was completed during the fourth quarter of we used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to pay off the remaining portion of the million term loan 
an additional million of cash was received pursuant to common stock options exercised and shares purchased through our employee stock purchase plan throughout fiscal year we are in compliance with all debt covenant requirements of the loan agreements 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  including expected cash flows from operating activities  existing cash balances  existing credit facilities and other financing sources  will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations we have entered into certain long term contractual obligations that will require various payments over future periods as follows contractual obligations in thousands of dollars payments due by period as of september  less than after total year years years years operating leases pension funding total contractual cash obligations the company is committed to meeting the annual minimum funding requirements relating to our pension plan 
based on current actuarial estimates  there are no minimum funding requirements expected for the next four years 
the company cannot estimate expected minimum funding requirements after four years at this time 
the company may also make contributions to the pension fund in excess of the minimum funding requirements during any year 

table of contents recently enacted accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  business combinations and no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas superseded apb opinion no 
 business combinations 
the provisions of sfas require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill  and  require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized 
sfas also requires that upon adoption of sfas  certain intangible assets be reclassified into or out of goodwill based on certain criteria 
sfas supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
the provisions of sfas prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and require that such assets be tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may be impaired  require that reporting units be identified for purposes of assessing potential impairments  and remove the forty year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  which is used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the company adopted sfas as of september  and completed the first step impairment test for goodwill relating to its panelview reporting unit as of that date 
the fair value of the panelview reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model using a long term growth rate of  and a discount rate of 
the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value  therefore  an impairment was not indicated 
as of september  the company completed the first step impairment tests for the goodwill relating to its panelview and ids reporting units 
the fair value of each reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model using a long term growth rate of and discount rates of and  respectively 
the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the related carrying value and  therefore  impairments were not indicated 
if our estimates of future cash flows for these reporting units decline  the related goodwill may become impaired 
amortization of million for the year ended september  relates to the company s intangible assets other than goodwill 
goodwill amortization in fiscal years and relates primarily to panelview 
pro forma net income for fiscal years and excluding goodwill amortization along with a comparison to is as follows 
table of contents net income as reported add back goodwill amortization expense  net of tax effect net income as adjusted earnings per share basic reported net income goodwill amortization adjusted earnings per share basic earnings per share diluted reported net income goodwill amortization adjusted earnings per share diluted in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
fin also requires additional disclosure by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable for guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosures required by fin are included in note  commitments and contingencies 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to fas sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in annual and interim financial statements 
the company has no plans to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied to the first interim or annual period beginning after december  additionally  certain transitional disclosures are required immediately if it is reasonably possible that the company will consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity when fin becomes effective 
the company does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
the adoption of sfas had no impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operation 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of september   we had no borrowings on our revolving line of credit with bank one 
should we borrow against the line  interest charged on these borrowings would be at either the bank s prime rate or libor plus 
during fiscal  the bank s prime rate averaged and was as of september  
table of contents we are subject to changes in the prime rate based on federal reserve actions and general market interest fluctuations 
we are also subject to fluctuations in the libor rate 
as of september   the libor rate was approximately 
should we begin borrowing against the credit line  annual interest expense would be approximately  for every million borrowed 
a hypothetical increased rate change of would increase interest expense by approximately  per million borrowed on an annual basis 
we believe that moderate interest rate increases will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
we have also invested in a million short term corporate note  which is subject to market fluctuations based on changes in interest rates 
we intend to hold the note until maturity at the end of january however  if we were to sell the note prior to maturity  we could lose a portion of the related investment 
we believe that we are not subject in any material way to other forms of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk on foreign customer purchase orders we accept payment in us dollars only or commodity price risk
