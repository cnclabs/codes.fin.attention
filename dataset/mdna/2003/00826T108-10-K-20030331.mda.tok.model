item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we have developed and intend to establish our genechip system as the platform of choice for acquiring  analyzing and managing complex genetic information 
our integrated genechip platform consists of disposable dna probe arrays containing gene sequences on a chip  certain reagents for use with the probe arrays  a scanner and other instruments used to process the probe arrays  and software to analyze and manage genetic information obtained from the probe arrays 
we sell our products directly to pharmaceutical  biotechnology  agrochemical  diagnostics and consumer products companies as well as academic research centers  private foundations and clinical reference laboratories in the united states  europe and japan 
we also sell some of our products through authorized distributors  principally in the asia pacific region 
perlegen sciences  inc in october  we formed perlegen sciences  inc perlegen as a wholly owned subsidiary 
in march  we contributed to perlegen the rights to use certain intellectual property with no cost basis and we have rights to use and commercialize certain data generated by perlegen in the array field 
from perlegen s inception through march  the operating results of perlegen were consolidated into our financial statements 
on march   perlegen completed a private financing with outside investors raising approximately million  which reduced our ownership position in perlegen to approximately 
two of the outside investors in this financing included trusts of which two of our current directors are trustees 
the investments by these trusts represented less than million of the total financing for perlegen 
in connection with perlegen s march  financing  we  and certain of our affiliates  including our chief executive officer stephen pa fodor  placed a portion of our collective holdings approximately into an irrevocable voting trust  relinquishing certain voting rights and  as such  we relinquished control of perlegen 
under the terms of the voting trust  the trustee  us bank corp 
formerly state street bank and trust company of california  was required to vote the shares held in the trust on all matters subject to shareholder vote in proportion to the votes of all non affymetrix shareholders 
in addition  the terms of the voting trust allow it to be terminated once affymetrix and its affiliates cease to own or more of the voting securities of perlegen 
as of december   we continued to hold an approximately economic ownership interest in perlegen but maintained no direct control over perlegen s operations 
on january   we entered into an agreement with perlegen to license certain perlegen technologies that are expected to accelerate our plan to design and commercialize microarrays for whole genome and candidate region dna analysis 
in addition to broadening our access to perlegen technologies  this licensing agreement advances by approximately three years affymetrix prior commercialization rights to the perlegen single nucleotide polymorphism snp database for development of chip based products 
under the terms of the licensing agreement  we paid perlegen a total of million in cash and granted perlegen a million credit which will be applied against the margin on our future sales of chips to perlegen 
this credit expires in three years 
this new agreement eliminates any future royalty obligations for array products that we commercialize based on information contained in perlegen s snp database 
in order to account for this transaction  we engaged an independent third party to conduct a valuation analysis of the licenses acquired 
based upon that independent valuation  we expect to record a charge of approximately million related to in process research and development in the first quarter of the remaining million will be recorded as an intangible asset and will be amortized over the useful lives of the various components of the asset from six to ten years 
on january   perlegen announced that it completed the first closing of a private financing round led by maverick capital  raising an aggregate of approximately million 
on february   perlegen completed this financing with a second closing raising an additional amount of approximately million 
as a result of this financing  our collective equity ownership in perlegen including that of our affiliates was reduced to approximately and the voting trust was terminated 
one of the outside investors in this financing included a trust of which one of our current directors is a trustee 
the investment by this trust represented  of the total financing for perlegen 
in connection with perlegen s january  financing  we agreed to have the right to designate two members of perlegen s board of directors which shall consist of not more than seven members 
previously  we had the right to designate three of the seven members of perlegen s board 
our two current designees to perlegen s board are also members of our board of directors 
we account for our ownership interest in perlegen on the equity method as we and our affiliates do not control the strategic  operating  investing and financing activities of perlegen 
as our investment in perlegen has no basis for accounting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles  we have not recorded any proportionate share of perlegen s operating losses in our financial statements since the completion of perlegen s initial financing 
pursuant to a supply agreement with perlegen  we sell whole wafers to perlegen for use in perlegen s research and development activities at our fully burdened cost of manufacturing 
if perlegen uses the wafers or arrays supplied by us in commercial activities for the benefit of third parties  then perlegen is obligated to make additional royalty payments for such use of these wafers so that we receive normal commercial margins on these wafers 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded revenue of million and million and a cost of revenue of million and million  respectively  as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
at december  and  the amounts due from perlegen were million and million  respectively  and have been included in accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
amounts due from perlegen are payable to us on our normal commercial terms 
we have no obligations to provide funding to perlegen nor do we guarantee or otherwise have any obligations related to the liabilities or results of operations of perlegen or its investors 
acquisition of neomorphic  inc in october  we acquired neomorphic  inc neomorphic  a privately held  computational genomics company 
we issued  shares of our common stock and million in cash in exchange for all of neomorphic s outstanding capital stock 
in addition  we assumed neomorphic s stock options  which if fully vested and exercised  would result in the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the results of neomorphic s operations have been included in the consolidated results from the date of acquisition 
approximately million of the purchase price was expensed in the fourth quarter of for the purchase of in process research and development 
the remaining million purchase price was allocated to goodwill million  existing technology million  the assembled workforce million  notes receivable million and various assets million 
the allocation was based on an independent third party valuation 
developed technology is being amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
goodwill and assembled workforce was amortized on a straight line basis in fiscal and over five years and three years  respectively until the company s adoption of sfas on january  see recent accounting pronouncements below 
acquisition of genetic microsystems  inc in february  we completed our acquisition of genetic microsystems  inc gms  a privately held massachusetts instrumentation company specializing in dna array technology 
under the terms of the acquisition  the outstanding shares of gms common and preferred stock were converted into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
in addition  we assumed gms stock options and warrants which if fully vested and exercised would result in the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
the merger has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and accordingly  the consolidated financial statements reflect the combined operations of both companies 
stock option exchange program on march   we filed a schedule tender offer  as subsequently amended on april   with the securities and exchange commission relating to an offer the offer to current employees excluding officers as defined in rule a f of the securities exchange act of  as amended of the company or its wholly owned subsidiaries  to exchange all of the options outstanding under the affymetrix  inc amended and restated stock plan  affymetrix  inc stock incentive plan  affymetrix genetic microsystems stock option plan  affymetrix neomorphic stock option plan  and affymetrix  inc amended and restated equity incentive plan collectively  the plans to purchase shares of the company s common stock common stock  for new options the new options to purchase shares of the common stock to be granted under the plans  upon the terms and subject to the conditions described in an offer to exchange and related letter of transmittal 
following the expiration of the offer on april   we accepted for exchange options to purchase  shares of its common stock the tendered options  representing approximately of the  options that were eligible to be tendered in the offer 
after a period of more than six months and a day from the expiration date of the offer  on october  we granted new options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock in exchange for the tendered options 
the new options were granted with exercise prices equal to which was the fair market value of our common stock on october  executive officers of the company were not permitted to participate in the offer 
the number of shares of common stock subject to the new options was equal to the number of shares of common stock subject to the tendered options that were accepted for exchange and canceled in accordance with the following exchange ratios exercise price of option tendered exchange ratio or less for for for or more for history of operating losses we have incurred operating losses in each year since our inception  including a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  and  as of such date  had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development  manufacturing and from selling  general and administrative costs associated with our operations  including the costs of patent related litigation 
these costs have exceeded our revenues and interest income  which to date have been generated principally from product sales  technology access and other license fees  royalties  collaborative research and development agreements  and from interest earned on cash and investment balances 
our ability to generate significant revenues and become profitable is dependent in large part on our ability to expand our customer base  increase sales of our current products to existing customers  manage our expense growth  and enter into additional supply  license and collaborative arrangements as well as on our ability and that of our collaborative partners to successfully manufacture and commercialize products incorporating our technologies in new applications and in new markets 
our operating results vary and depend on numerous factors 
revenues are principally impacted by the volume and price of product sales  the timing of orders and deliveries of products  design fees  royalties  license fees  and other research revenues under collaborative and licensing agreements 
expenses are principally impacted by the cost of goods for products  the magnitude and duration of research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses are particularly subject to variation as a result of fluctuations in the intensity of legal activities associated with our on going intellectual property litigation 
our operating results may also fluctuate significantly depending on other factors 
to maintain or gain market acceptance of our products in the face of the introduction of new products by our competitors  we may have to reduce or discount the price of our products resulting in an adverse impact on revenues and gross margins 
other factors that may significantly impact our operating results include the outcome of on going or future litigation  the need for additional royalty bearing licenses  adoption of new technologies  the cost  quality and availability of reagents and components  regulatory actions  and third party reimbursement policies 
results of operations years ended december  and december  product revenue 
product sales increased to million in  up from million in the increase was primarily due to growth in unit sales and an increase in the average sales price of genechip probe arrays and related supplies 
revenue from sales of probe arrays and related supplies increased to million in  up from million in revenue from the sale of instruments was million in and million in other product revenue  which primarily consists of subscription fees earned under easyaccess agreements  service revenue  and related product revenue decreased to million in  down from million in revenue from perlegen sciences  inc 
revenue from the sale of wafers to perlegen  an affiliated party  was million in  up from million in the increase was due to increased sales of wafers to perlegen and the fact that perlegen was a wholly owned subsidiary of affymetrix until march  and therefore  its activities in the first quarter of were consolidated into the financial results of affymetrix 
in addition  when perlegen uses the wafers or arrays supplied by us in commercial activities for the benefit of third parties  then perlegen is obligated to make additional payments for such wafers so that we receive normal commercial margins on these wafers 
we recognized revenues of million in related to payments for such wafers 
the revenue associated with the margin on third party activities represented approximately of the total revenue received from perlegen 
in  we expect the level of revenue from the sale of wafers to perlegen to decrease consistent with its contractual obligations 
research revenue 
research revenue includes custom probe array design fees  full time equivalent fte support for the company s research collaborations  and grant funding 
research revenue increased to million in  up from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in custom probe array design fees related to our genechip customexpress array program 
license fees and royalty revenues 
license fees and royalty revenues decreased to million in  down from million in the decrease in license fees and royalty revenues was primarily due to a decrease in significant new license agreements 
licenses permit the licensees to utilize our intellectual property on a non exclusive basis over specified periods for either internal research and development  or in some cases  for commercialization of products 
cost of product revenues and gross margins 
cost of product revenue increased to million in  up from million in the increase in cost of product revenues resulted principally from unit growth of approximately  genechip probe arrays in product sales 
gross margins on product sales improved to in  up from in principal factors that favorably impacted gross margins included favorable changes in product sales mix  increased production volumes of for probe arrays resulting in improved overhead absorption  and improved probe array manufacturing yields 
cost of perlegen revenues 
pursuant to a supply agreement with perlegen  we sell whole wafers to perlegen for use in perlegen s research and development activities at our fully burdened cost of manufacturing 
cost of perlegen revenue increased to million in  up from million in the increase was due to increased sales of wafers to perlegen and the fact that perlegen was a wholly owned subsidiary of affymetrix until march  and therefore  its activities in the first quarter of were consolidated into our financial results 
we expect the cost of perlegen revenues to decline in as perlegen s contractual obligations to purchase wafers decreases 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  which primarily consist of basic research  product research and development and manufacturing process and development  increased to million in  up from million in in  research and development expenses included million of expenses associated with perlegen that are not included in excluding the expenses related to perlegen  the increase in was primarily due to expanded investments in basic research as well as in the development costs associated with our new genechip scanner we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to a long term sustainable competitive advantage and critical to expansion into additional high throughput markets such as toxicogenomics  pharmacogenomics and clinical applications 
we expect research and development spending to increase as basic research and product research and development efforts continue to expand 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in  up from in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of million related to increased investments in the worldwide sales  marketing  technical support  and administrative infrastructures 
specifically in  we significantly expanded our european operations and established our sales and support infrastructure in japan 
this growth in spending was partially offset by a decrease of million in legal expense as the result of settlement of litigation 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase as we expand sales  marketing  and technical support functions  increase headcount in management and administrative functions  prosecute and defend our intellectual property position and defend against claims made by third parties in ongoing litigation 
we expect legal costs to vary substantially as the intensity of legal activity changes 
there can be no assurance that we have adequately estimated our exposure for potential damages associated with pending or future litigation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
upon the acquisition of neomorphic in october  the fair value of unvested common stock subject to restricted stock agreements and the intrinsic value of the unvested options held by employees were deducted from the purchase price and allocated to deferred stock compensation 
the deferred stock compensation of million is being amortized to compensation expense over the remaining vesting term  generally two to four years 
the fair value of unvested options held by non employees was also deducted from the purchase price and will be periodically revalued as they vest in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
stock compensation expense decreased to million in compared to million in amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
we incurred charges of million in for the amortization of purchased intangibles related to the acquisition of neomorphic  inc  down from million in the decrease is due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas on january  in accordance with sfas  we have reclassified million of assembled workforce to goodwill and ceased the amortization of goodwill 
we also completed our review for potential impairment of goodwill as of june   and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill 
in addition  there were no indicators of potential impairment at december  interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net decreased to million in  down from million in the decrease in interest income and other  net was primarily due to a decrease in interest income because we experienced lower returns on our cash and marketable securities portfolio 
in  we recorded a million write down related to an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in orchid biosciences  inc and a million unrealized loss related to the equity method treatment of our investment in a venture capital limited partnership 
in addition  we recognized fewer gains on the repurchase of our convertible subordinated notes 
in  gains from the repurchase of our convertible subordinated notes were reported as extraordinary income 
the gains were reclassified during fiscal from extraordinary income in accordance with financial accounting standard fas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections to interest and other income 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in  down from million in interest expense is primarily comprised of interest that we pay on our convertible subordinated notes which come due in and income tax provision 
the provision for income tax was approximately million in  up from million in in  the provision consists of current taxes accrued on the profits attributable to our foreign operations and state taxes 
in  the provision consists of current taxes accrued on the profits attributable to our foreign operations 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes the historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses in all prior years  at december   we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which will expire at various dates in through  if not utilized 
in addition  we have federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
we believe the effect of such limitations will not result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
years ended december  and december  product revenue 
product sales increased to million in  up from million in the increase was primarily due to growth in unit sales partially offset by a decline in the average selling price of genechip probe arrays and an increase in the average selling price of genechip systems partially offset by a decline in unit sales of spotted array products 
shipments of genechip probe arrays increased to million in  up from million in shipments of instruments decreased to million in down from million in  primarily due to the decreased sales of spotted array instrumentation in the low density array market 
other product revenue  which primarily consists of subscription fees earned under easyaccess agreements  service revenue  and related product revenue increased to million in  up from million in in the first quarter of  we discovered ambiguities in the unigene u database build that was used in the design of the murine genome u set of genechip arrays 
as a result  we redesigned these arrays and had discussions with our affected customers to address their individual needs 
based on these discussions  we offered replacement arrays to these customers 
all replacement arrays were shipped by the end of the third quarter of product revenues in were negatively impacted as a result of this situation 
revenue from perlegen sciences  inc 
we sell whole wafers to perlegen at our fully burdened cost of manufacturing 
revenue and cost of revenue for the year ended december  was million 
except for the increased manufacturing leverage gained through increased manufacturing volume from the production of whole wafers for perlegen  revenue from sales to perlegen did not have any net impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
research revenue 
research revenue includes custom probe array design fees  full time equivalent fte support for our research collaborations and grant funding 
research revenue decreased to million in  down from million in the decline in research revenue is primarily the result of lower activity under government grants 
license fees and royalty revenues 
license fees and royalty revenues decreased to million in  down from million in the decrease in license fees and royalty revenues was primarily due to a lower level of license fee activity in specifically  in we recognized license fees of approximately million from parties licensed to manufacture and sell low density arrays and to distribute our low density array equipment 
cost of product revenues and gross margins 
cost of product revenue increased to million in  up from million in the increase in cost of product revenues resulted principally from the unit growth of approximately  genechip probe arrays in product sales 
gross margins on product sales improved to  up from in principal factors that favorably impacted gross margins included improved manufacturing yields  technologies and processes related to the genechip probe arrays  increased production volumes of probe arrays and favorable changes in product sales mix 
factors negatively impacting gross margins included additional warranty expenses and provisions for excess inventory associated with instrumentation and the spotting array business 
our decision in march to replace murine genome u arrays that contained incorrect probe sequences arising from ambiguities that we discovered in the unigene u database build  resulted in an incremental warranty expense of million to cover costs associated with the replacement of murine genome u set of arrays sold in calendar year we recorded an additional charge of million in the first quarter of to cover replacement costs of the murine genome u arrays sold in the first quarter of the charges recorded in and the first quarter of were based upon the number of replacement arrays 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  which primarily consist of basic research  product research and development and manufacturing process and development  increased to million in  up from million in the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a full year in of the integration of neomorphic which was acquired in october and the hiring of additional research and development personnel 
we recorded million in research and development expenses associated with perlegen in the first quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in  down from million in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decline in legal expenses in associated with our patent litigation 
specifically  we incurred significantly higher legal costs in as compared to primarily associated with the settlement with oxford gene technology  ltd 
ogt  for which a charge of million was recorded in in  we incurred lower legal expenses as a result of the settlements with ogt  incyte and nuvelo 
merger related costs 
merger related costs of million in were comprised of transaction costs arising from the acquisition of gms which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
stock compensation expense increased to million in as compared to in stock compensation expense relates principally to the amortization of deferred stock compensation resulting from the acquisition of neomorphic  inc which occurred in october the increase in stock compensation expense in was the result of a full year of amortization in compared to two months of amortization in amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
goodwill of million net of accumulated amortization of million at december  was generated from the acquisition of neomorphic and represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
other intangible assets of million net of accumulated amortization of million at december  arising from the purchase of neomorphic include existing technology and the assembled workforce 
these assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas on january   we reclassified million of assembled workforce to goodwill and ceased the amortization of goodwill 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net increased to million in  up from million in in  we realized gains of million as a result of the sale of investments and million from the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes that was previously classified as extraordinary income 
in connection with the repurchase of the convertible subordinated notes  we recorded extraordinary income of approximately million in fiscal which was reclassified during fiscal to interest and other income  in accordance with financial accounting standard fas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
excluding these gains  interest income decreased in as compared to as a result of lower average cash balances and lower yields on investments 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in  up from million for the increase was primarily due to the interest expense associated with the convertible subordinated notes 
income tax provision 
the provision for income taxes was approximately million in  down from million in the provision consists of current taxes accrued on the profits attributable to our foreign operations for and the decrease is attributable to reduced withholding taxes 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes the historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses in all prior years  at december   we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through product sales  sales of equity and debt securities  collaborative agreements  interest income  and licensing of our technology 
our material future obligations are as follows in thousands total after convertible subordinated notes   operating leases      bci commitment note   other commitments      total contractual obligations     net cash provided in operating activities was million in compared to net cash used of million in and million in the improvement in net cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to the decrease in our net loss  an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liability balances partially offset by an increase in our accounts receivable 
in and  the net cash used for operations was primarily to fund our operating losses as well as our working capital requirements 
operating lease commitments increased million due to the signing of four lease extensions for some of our facilities in california and the addition of a lease associated with our office in japan 
our investing activities  other than purchases  sales and maturities of available for sale securities  consisted of capital expenditures  which totaled million in  million  and million in capital expenditures for through included investments in facilities and production and laboratory equipment 
in addition  during  million was invested in non marketable equity securities and another million in technology rights 
in  we provided a loan of million to nuvelo 
the loan bears interest at  matures in and is repayable by nuvelo at any time 
the loan balance plus accrued interest was million as of december  at december   nuvelo was not in compliance with certain financial covenants under the loan agreement 
as a result  we can require nuvelo to repay amounts due under the loan agreement with a combination of shares of nuvelo common stock and cash  at nuvelo s option 
management believes nuvelo will ultimately be able to comply with the terms of the loan agreement 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in in  we repurchased million face value of the convertible subordinated notes that bear interest at per annum for cash consideration of million and recognized a gain of million 
in addition  net proceeds of million resulted from the exercise of stock options 
during  we repurchased million face value of the convertible subordinated notes that bear interest at per annum for cash consideration of million and recognized a gain of million 
the cash flows from financing activities are primarily the result of the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes in february the convertible subordinated notes bear interest at per annum and mature in as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities of approximately million 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned operations and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
however  this expectation is based on our current operating plan and capital expenditure plan  which is subject to change  and therefore we could require additional funding 
in addition  we expect that our capital requirements will increase over the next several years as we expand our worldwide commercial operations  expand our manufacturing capabilities  increase our investments in third parties and expand our research and development efforts 
our long term capital expenditure requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the expansion of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  our ability to maintain existing collaborative and customer arrangements and establish and maintain new collaborative and customer arrangements  the progress of our research and development programs  initiation or expansion of research programs and collaborations  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements  the purchase of patent licenses  and other factors 
we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
our inability to raise capital would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain accounting policies are particularly important to the reporting of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
our significant accounting policies include revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred for most of our products at the time of shipment 
we make estimates of warranty costs and of allowances for doubtful accounts based on historical experience  individual customer financial viability  and age of individual receivables 
for sales of software licenses  we defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on vendor specific evidence of fair value  which is determined from our list price and actual transactions 
research revenue is comprised of amounts earned from services performed pursuant to commercial collaboration agreements  including custom probe array design fees  as well as government grants 
research revenue is recorded in the period in which the costs are incurred or at the time the custom probe array design is completed 
payments received related to substantive at risk milestones are recognized upon the occurrence or completion of the milestone events 
direct costs associated with these contracts and grants are reported as research and development expense 
while milestone events are specified in our contracts  we must apply judgment in determining whether a milestone was substantially at risk and therefore justify the recognition of related revenue as the culmination of a separate earnings process 
to date  milestone revenue has not been a significant portion of our research revenues 
license and royalty revenues include amounts earned from third parties licensed under our intellectual property 
license revenues are recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements  generally upon receipt unless we have continuing performance obligations  in which case the license revenue is recognized ratably over the period of expected performance 
royalty revenues are recognized under the terms of the related agreements generally upon manufacture or shipment of a product by a licensee 
a portion of our sales and accounts receivable are denominated in foreign currencies 
historically  we have not hedged our foreign currency exposures and have not had significant foreign currency differences 
however  in we established a foreign exchange risk management committee fxrmc which has been chartered to review and manage foreign currency exposures 
in early  we began hedging activities in order to manage the risks associated with a portion of our foreign currency exposures 
available for sale securities we report all debt securities with maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less that are readily convertible into cash and have insignificant interest rate risk as cash equivalents 
cash equivalents and available for sale securities consist of marketable equity and debt securities 
management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase 
as of december  and  our investments in debt securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
the cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
this amortization is included in interest income 
realized gains and losses on available for sale securities are also included in interest income 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest income 
the fair values of securities are based on quoted market prices 
all of our available for sale securities are included in current assets as management considers the securities readily available to fund current operations 
accounting for perlegen and other equity investments as of december   we owned an approximately ownership interest in perlegen and we have accounted for our ownership interest in perlegen on the equity method since march  as we determined that we do not control its operations 
factors we considered in determining our level of control in perlegen included the fact that we and certain of our affiliates had placed approximately of our voting rights into an irrevocable voting trust which was required to vote in proportion to the votes of the other shareholders  we had no ability to terminate or modify the trust unilaterally  we had the right to appoint only three out of seven seats on perlegen s board and we had no commitment to provide additional funding to perlegen 
following perlegen s january  financing  our ownership interest in perlegen was reduced to approximately 
as such  we continue to account for our ownership interest in perlegen on the equity method as we and our affiliates continued to collectively control less than of the voting shares of perlegen and also continued to have no control over the strategic  operating  investing and financing activities of perlegen 
factors we consider in determining our level of control in perlegen included the fact that we and certain of our affiliates own less than of the voting shares of perlegen  we have the right to appoint only two out of seven seats on perlegen s board and we have no commitment to provide additional funding to perlegen 
see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting related to perlegen 
equity investments in venture stage entities is classified on our classified balance sheet in other assets 
we periodically assess the carrying value of these equity investments based on information available to the company 
these investments are accounted for on the cost method because we own less than of the respective entities and we do not have significant influence over the operations of the issuers 
we record gains losses upon sale of the investment  and losses when there has been an other than temporary decline in the value of these investments 
we recognized expense of million in and no expense in and as a result of charges related to other than temporary declines in the fair values of certain of our marketable equity securities 
accounts and notes receivable trade accounts receivables are recorded at net invoice value and notes receivables are recorded at contractual value plus accrued interest 
interest income on notes receivable is recognized according to the terms of each related agreement 
we consider receivables past due based on the related contractual terms 
we review our exposure to amounts receivable and reserve specific amounts if collectibility is no longer reasonably assured 
we also reserve a percentage of the net trade receivable balance based on collection history 
inventories we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
we apply judgment in determining the provisions for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience and anticipated product demand 
accounting for goodwill  acquired technology rights and other intangible assets our intangible assets are comprised principally of technology rights 
we apply judgment in determining the useful lives of our intangible assets and whether such assets are impaired 
factors we consider include the life of the underlying patent  the expected period of benefit from the use of the technology  existence of competing technology and potential obsolescence 
to date  we have not experienced any impairments to our intangible assets 
goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired arising from the acquisition of neomorphic in october  prior to  goodwill was amortized using the straight line method over five years 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  we reclassified million of assembled workforce to goodwill and has ceased amortization of goodwill 
all remaining and future acquired goodwill will be subject to impairment tests annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach 
contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings principally related to intellectual property matters 
based on the information available at the balance sheet dates  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we will record a reserve in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
any reserves recorded may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
recent accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas provides a single accounting model for  and supersedes previous guidance on  accounting and reporting for the impairment disposal of long lived assets 
sfas sets new criteria for the classification of assets held for sale and changes the reporting of discontinued operations 
the adoption of sfas had no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standard no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  sfas which we adopted as of july  the rescission of fas  reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  automatically defaults issuers to apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transaction  that is to distinguish transactions that are a part of an entity s recurring operations from those that are unusual and infrequent 
we have concluded that these repurchases are not unusual or infrequent  and therefore are not extraordinary in nature 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas  we have reclassified the gain related to the repurchase of convertible notes to other income in the accompanying statements of operations instead of an extraordinary gain from repurchase of convertible notes as it was originally reported for the year ended december  in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas and issue relates to sfas s requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
a fundamental conclusion reached by the fasb in this statement is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
therefore  this statement eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in issue this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
severance pay under sfas  in many cases  would be recognized over time rather than up front 
the fasb decided that if the benefit arrangement requires employees to render future service beyond a minimum retention period a liability should be recognized as employees render service over the future service period even if the benefit formula used to calculate an employee s termination benefit is based on length of service 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in november  the fasb issued the fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which clarifies the requirements for a guarantor s accounting and disclosures of certain guarantees issued and outstanding 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  consistent with the interpretation  we have adopted the disclosure requirements in this form k and will adopt the provisions effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  in its fiscal quarter ending march  the adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
this statement provides three alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the new disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for financial reports of annual periods ending and for interim periods beginning after december  we have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
or apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for employee stock options 
in accordance with sfas  we have adopted the annual period disclosure requirements in this form k and will adopt the disclosure provisions effective for interim periods in its fiscal quarter ending march  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structures used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our convertible subordinated notes 
fixed rate securities and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall and floating rate borrowings may lead to additional interest expense if interest rates increase 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of less than three years 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio subject to interest rate risk thereafter total fair value at december assets available for sale securities    average interest rate loan receivable    average interest rate liabilities convertible subordinated notes due  average interest rate convertible subordinated notes due  average interest rate we are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities in our portfolio of investments entered into to further our business and strategic objectives 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in equity prices would not result in a material decrease in our available for sale securities for fiscal and result in a decrease of approximately million for fiscal based on our position at december  and  respectively 
however  actual results may differ materially 
we derive a portion of our revenues in foreign currencies  predominantly in europe and japan 
historically  we have not hedged our foreign currency exposures and have not had significant foreign currency differences 
however  in we established a foreign exchange risk management committee fxrmc which has been chartered to review and manage foreign currency exposures 
in early  the fxrmc began hedging activities by using currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency exposures created from our activities denominated in foreign currencies
