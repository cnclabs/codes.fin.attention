item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of cerus should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of future results 
overview since its inception in  cerus has devoted substantially all of its efforts and resources to the research  development and clinical testing of medical systems based on its helinx technology 
cerus has been unprofitable since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
except for the intercept blood system for platelets  which is approved for sale in europe  all of cerus product candidates are in the research and development stage  and cerus has not received significant revenue from product sales 
cerus must conduct significant research  development  pre clinical and clinical evaluation  commercialization and regulatory compliance activities on these product candidates that  together with anticipated general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial losses at least until after commercialization of additional products 
cerus ability to achieve a profitable level of operations in the future will depend on its ability to successfully complete development and obtain additional regulatory approvals and on baxter s ability to commercialize and achieve market acceptance of the intercept blood system 
cerus may never achieve a profitable level of operations 
further  under the agreements discussed below  baxter provides significant funding for development of the intercept blood system  based on an annual budgeting process  and is responsible for manufacturing and marketing the products following regulatory approvals 
these agreements may be modified or terminated 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to collaborative arrangements  contract research and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we record accrued liabilities for certain contract research activities  including clinical trials  pre clinical safety studies  external laboratory studies and development activities performed by baxter  for research and development services performed 
some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  which have been reviewed by our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue and research and development expenses revenue related to the cost reimbursement provisions under development contracts is recognized as the costs on the project are incurred 
revenue related to at risk milestones specified under development contracts is recognized as the milestones are achieved 
license fees and payments for achieved milestones are non refundable and are not subject to future performance 
cerus receives certain united states government grants that support its research effort in defined research projects 
these grants generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs incurred as defined in the various grants 
revenue associated with these grants is recognized as costs under each grant are incurred 
investments cerus considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
cash equivalents consist principally of short term money market instruments and commercial paper 
cerus has classified all debt securities as available for sale at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
accrued liabilities cerus records accrued liabilities for certain contract research activities  including clinical trials  pre clinical safety studies  external laboratory studies and development activities performed by baxter  for research and development services performed 
some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
development partners agreement with baxter for the development of the intercept blood system for platelets 
cerus has a development and commercialization agreement with baxter for the joint development of the intercept blood system for inactivation of viruses  bacteria and other infectious pathogens in platelets used for transfusion 
this agreement provides for baxter and cerus to generally share system development costs equally  subject to mutually determined budgets established from time to time  and for cerus to receive approximately of revenue from sales of inactivation system disposables after each party is reimbursed for its cost of goods to the extent the cost exceeds specific amounts 
baxter has an exclusive  worldwide distribution license and is responsible for manufacturing and marketing the intercept blood system for platelets 
agreement with baxter for the development of the intercept blood system for red blood cells and intercept blood system for plasma 
cerus also has a development and commercialization agreement with baxter for the joint development of the intercept blood system for inactivation of viruses  bacteria and other infectious pathogens in red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma  or ffp  for transfusion 
this agreement provides for baxter and cerus generally to share intercept blood system for red blood cells development costs equally  subject to mutually determined budgets established from time to time 
cerus is solely responsible for funding the development costs of the intercept blood system for plasma 
baxter has an exclusive  worldwide distribution license and will be responsible for manufacturing and marketing the intercept blood system for red blood cells and intercept blood system for plasma following regulatory approvals 
the agreement also provides for an equal sharing of revenue from sales of intercept blood system for red blood cells disposables  and for cerus to receive and baxter to receive of revenue from sales of intercept blood system for plasma disposables  after each party is reimbursed for its cost of goods and a specified percentage allocation  not to exceed of revenue  is retained by baxter for marketing and administrative expenses 
from inception through december   cerus has received million in equity investments from baxter and million in an equity investment from baxter international inc and subsidiaries pension trust  and has recognized million in revenue from baxter 
development funding is in the form of balancing payments made by baxter to cerus  if necessary  to reimburse cerus for development spending in excess of the levels determined by baxter and cerus 
development funding revenue is recognized as the related project costs are incurred 
in october  cerus received a million loan commitment from baxter capital corporation 
in january  cerus drew million under the loan facility 
the interest rate for the loan is per annum 
no repayment of principal and interest is due until january the loan is secured with collateral based on future revenue from sales of the intercept blood system for platelets 
agreement with kirin 
in january  cerus entered into a collaborative agreement with the pharmaceutical division of kirin to develop and market products for stem cell transplantation based on cerus helinx technology 
under the terms of the agreement  cerus and kirin will jointly develop the products 
cerus received an initial license fee of million 
the license fee is being deferred and recognized as development funding ratably over the development period 
cerus may not receive additional funding from kirin 
although the agreement calls for kirin to fund all development expenses for the asia pacific region and a portion of cerus development activities aimed at obtaining product approval in the united states  no such development activities by cerus are currently ongoing 
upon product approval  kirin has exclusive rights to market the products in the asia pacific region  including japan  china  korea and australia  and cerus will receive a specified share of product revenue  including a royalty and reimbursement of its cost of goods 
cerus retains all marketing rights for the rest of the world  including the united states and europe 
cooperative agreement with the armed forces of the united states 
in february  cerus was awarded a million cooperative agreement by the army medical research acquisition activity division of the department of defense 
cerus received the award to develop its pathogen inactivation technologies to improve the safety and availability of blood that may be used by the united states armed forces for medical transfusions 
under the conditions of the agreement  cerus will conduct research on the inactivation of infectious pathogens  including unusual viruses  bacteria and parasites  which are of particular concern to the armed forces 
cerus  in collaboration with investigators at walter reed army institute of research  also will investigate ways to improve the storage and shelf life of blood and blood components  which may be used for medical transfusion support in combat zones 
also under the terms of the agreement  cerus would receive commercial rights to the discoveries and inventions arising from the research performed under the collaboration 
in september  cerus was awarded an additional million cooperative agreement to continue funding of these projects 
agreement with the national marrow donor program 
in october  cerus and the national marrow donor program  a non profit corporation  entered into an agreement under which the nmdp would sponsor a clinical trial of cerus helinx t cells in patients receiving matched unrelated bone marrow transplants 
the agreement was amended in december under the amended agreement  cerus will provide its helinx compound amotosalen  illumination devices  training of clinical sites and program oversight in exchange for reimbursement by the nmdp of cerus related costs 
agreement with the consortium for plasma science 
in december  cerus and the consortium entered into an agreement for the development of a pathogen inactivation system for source plasma used for fractionation 
the consortium is co funded by four plasma fractionation companies alpha therapeutics corporation  aventis behring  bayer corporation and baxter 
the consortium  which is a separate entity from its members  provides research and development funding worldwide for technologies to improve the safety of source plasma 
under the agreement  the consortium funded development of cerus proprietary technology for use with source plasma 
cerus does not expect to receive additional funding from the consortium 
subject to the consortium having met certain funding requirements  cerus will pay the consortium a royalty based on a percentage of product sales  if any 
results of operations compared with revenue 
for the year ended december   milestone and development funding from baxter and the consortium  which are related parties of cerus  increased to million from million for the increase was due to a million milestone payment from baxter earned in upon regulatory approval of the intercept blood system for platelets in europe 
cerus does not expect to receive additional development funding from baxter or the consortium 
development funding from baxter was of total revenue for development funding from the consortium was less than of total revenue for development funding from other sources  which includes kirin and the nmdp  decreased to million for from million for the decrease was due to a million decrease in development funding from kirin in development funding from the nmdp was of total revenue for development funding from kirin was of total revenue for revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements increased to million for from million for the increase was principally due to a million increase in program expenditures under the cooperative agreements with the armed forces of the united states entered into in february and september during  cerus also recognized revenue under a grant from the national institutes of health that expired in july there can be no assurance that cerus will receive additional government grants in the future 
cerus recognized  of product sales revenue in from sales of the intercept blood system for platelets in europe 
cerus expects that product sales revenue in will increase relative to cerus does not expect product sales revenue in to be sufficient for the company to achieve a level of profitable operations 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for scientific personnel  payments to consultants  supplies and chemicals used in in house laboratories  costs of research and development facilities  depreciation of equipment and external contract research expenses  including clinical trials  pre clinical safety studies  compound manufacturing and other laboratory studies 
research and development expenses increased to million for from million for the increase was due primarily to the addition of scientific personnel  increased facilities costs and increased development spending at baxter 
cerus total research and development costs incurred included million for the intercept blood system program and million for all other programs for  and million for the intercept blood system program and million for all other programs for cerus anticipates that its research and development expenses will continue to increase as additional filings for regulatory approval are prepared  submitted and addressed with the fda and product configuration and testing are completed  phase iii clinical trials of the intercept blood system for red blood cells continue and research and development activity relating to its other pre clinical programs increases 
due to the inherent uncertainties and risks associated with developing biomedical products  including but not limited to intense and changing government regulation  uncertainty of future pre clinical and clinical study results and uncertainty associated with manufacturing  it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost to complete these research and development projects 
cerus faces numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the successful completion of its research and development projects  see risk factors above 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase was principally attributable to the addition of administrative personnel  increased costs for insurance and increased facilities expenses associated with expansion of cerus operations 
cerus expects its general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as development activities expand 
net interest income 
net interest income decreased to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to reduced investment balances carried by cerus in and less favorable yields on investments as a result of declining interest rates 
cerus expects to earn interest at market rates in proportion to the balances it maintains 
compared with revenue 
for the year ended december   development revenue from baxter and the consortium increased to million from million for the increase was primarily from increased development revenue from baxter for the intercept blood system for red blood cells as a result of increased expenses incurred by cerus for pre clinical safety studies  compound manufacturing and clinical trials in revenue earned under the agreements with baxter is dependent on the relative spending by cerus and baxter on the programs for which development costs are shared 
development funding from baxter was of total revenue for development funding from the consortium was of total revenue for the year ended december  development funding from other sources  which includes kirin  was million for development funding from kirin was of total revenue for revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements increased to million for from million for the increase was principally due to revenue recognized from a cooperative agreement with the armed forces of the united states entered into in february research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for from million for the increase was due primarily to the addition of scientific personnel and consultants  increased development spending at baxter and increased costs for pre clinical safety studies and compound manufacturing 
cerus total research and development costs incurred included million for the intercept blood system program and million for all other programs for  and million for the intercept blood system program and million for all other programs for general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase was principally attributable to the addition of administrative personnel and increased facilities expenses associated with expansion of cerus operations 
net interest income 
net interest income increased to million for from million for the increase was attributable primarily to increased average cash and investments balances from proceeds of the private placements of common stock to institutional investors in august and may  net of reduced yields on investments due to declining interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources cerus primary sources of capital to date have consisted of public offerings and private placements of equity securities  payments received under its agreements with baxter  kirin  the consortium and the nmdp  united states government grants and cooperative agreements  the loan from baxter capital corporation and interest income 
to date  cerus has not received significant revenue from product sales  and it will not derive significant revenue from product sales unless and until more products under development receive regulatory approval and achieve market acceptance 
at december   cerus had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to million in the use of cash primarily resulted from a net loss of million offset by changes in other operating balances 
net cash provided by investing activities in of approximately million resulted principally from the sales and maturities of million of short term investments  offset by the purchases of million of short term investments and the purchase of million of furniture and equipment 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to decreased cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances from operating activities 
in october  cerus received a million loan commitment from baxter capital corporation 
in january  cerus drew million under the loan facility 
the interest rate for the loan is per annum 
no repayment of principal and interest is due until january the loan is secured with collateral based on future revenue from sales of the intercept blood system for platelets 
baxter capital corporation is a subsidiary of baxter international  inc and is a related party to cerus 
cerus believes that its available cash balances  including proceeds from the loan  together with anticipated cash flows from existing development and grant arrangements  will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements until at least mid these near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including the development progress and costs of the intercept blood system and other programs  payments by baxter and the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending cerus intellectual property position 
cerus long term capital requirements will be dependent on these factors and on cerus ability to raise capital through public or private equity or debt financings or through additional collaborative arrangements or government grants  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of the intercept blood system and other product candidates under development  competitive developments and regulatory factors 
if baxter were to terminate its agreements with cerus  cerus might not be able to meet its long term capital requirements 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to investors in cerus  and may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
in august  cerus filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission to offer and sell up to million of common stock and or debt securities 
cerus has no current commitments to offer or sell securities pursuant to this registration statement 
commitments our commitments were as follows payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations long term debt obligation   minimum purchase requirements capital lease obligations operating leases   total contractual cash obligations   item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cerus maintains an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  if material 
unrealized gains and losses at december  and were not material 
cerus investments primarily consist of short term money market mutual funds  united states government obligations and commercial paper 
cerus does not believe its exposure to interest rate risk to be material given the short term nature of its investment portfolio 
the table below presents the amortized principal amount  which approximates fair value  and related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at december  amortized principal amount weighted average interest rate in thousands cash equivalents  short term investments days year  short term investments years  total investments
