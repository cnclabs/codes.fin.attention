item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion presents the key factors that have affected the businesses of meredith corporation and its subsidiaries meredith the company over the last three years 
this commentary should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the year financial history presented elsewhere in this form k 
all per share amounts in this section refer to diluted earnings per share and are computed on an after tax basis 
forward looking statements sections of this annual report and management s public commentary from time to time may contain certain forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
the words expect  anticipate  believe  likely  will  and similar terms generally identify forward looking statements 
these statements are based on management s current knowledge and estimates of factors affecting the company s operations 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking information  actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated 
factors that could adversely affect future results include but are not limited to downturns in national and or local economies  a softening of the domestic advertising market  world  national  or local events that could disrupt broadcast television  increased consolidation among major advertisers or other events depressing the level of advertising spending  the unexpected loss of one or more major clients  changes in consumer reading  purchase  order  and or television viewing patterns  unanticipated increases in paper  postage  printing  or syndicated programming costs  changes in television network affiliation agreements  technological developments affecting products or methods of distribution  changes in government regulations affecting the company s industries  unexpected changes in interest rates  and any acquisitions and or dispositions 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  management expectations for future performance  and other assumptions as appropriate 
the company reevaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis  results  however  may vary from these estimates 
the following are the accounting policies that management believes are most critical to the preparation of the company s financial statements and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
these and other significant accounting policies are explained in the first note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets meredith adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective july  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized to earnings and be tested for impairment at least annually 
the impairment tests are based on a fair value approach as described in sfas no 
the estimated fair values of these assets are determined by developing discounted future cash flow analyses 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives  the carrying value is evaluated whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value is not recoverable when the projected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value 
tests for impairment or recoverability require significant management judgment  and future events affecting cash flows and market conditions could result in impairment losses 
broadcast rights broadcast rights and the liabilities for future payments are recorded at cost when the programs become available for airing 
amortization of broadcast rights is recorded on an accelerated basis over the contract period 
broadcast rights are valued at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
the determination of net realizable value is based on management s expectations of future net revenues and is therefore highly subjective 
future revenues can be affected by changes in the level of advertising demand  competition from other television stations or other media  changes in television programming ratings  changes in the planned usage of programming materials  and other factors 
changes such as these can lead to revised estimates of future net revenues and therefore result in the write down of broadcast rights 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized only when realized realizable and earned 
revenues are recorded net of provisions for estimated future returns and other allowances 
the recognition of revenues from both the newsstand sale of magazines and the sale of books requires significant assumptions regarding reserves for future returns 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and current marketplace conditions 
reserves are adjusted continually on the basis of actual results 
the company has not experienced significant deviations between estimated and actual results 
pension and postretirement expense pension and postretirement benefit expenses are actuarially determined and include assumptions regarding discount rates  expected returns on plan assets  and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
changes in assumptions would affect associated assets and or liabilities as well as benefit expenses 
management monitors trends in the marketplace and relies on guidance from employee benefit specialists to arrive at reasonable estimates  reviews the estimates annually  and updates them as deemed necessary 
nevertheless  the estimates are highly subjective and may vary from actual results 
significant events acquisitions  exchanges  and dispositions in december  meredith purchased american baby magazine and related assets american baby group from primedia inc for million million plus certain costs 
american baby magazine  introduced in  is published monthly and has a circulation of million 
other american baby group properties acquired include childbirth and first year of life magazines  three hispanic titles and related marketing programs  the american baby television program currently shown on the discovery channel television network  web sites  custom publications  and other related programs 
in june  meredith exchanged its orlando and ocala  fl  television stations for kptv in portland  or 
kptv was a upn affiliate at the time 
the transaction with news corporation and fox television stations  inc created a meredith duopoly in portland  where the company also owns kpdx tv  a fox affiliate at the time 
a duopoly  defined as the ownership of two stations in a single market  offers increased efficiency while providing stronger outlets for advertisers and viewers 
also as part of the transaction  meredith entered into new affiliation agreements for all of its fox affiliated stations and switched network affiliations between kptv and kpdx tv 
for financial reporting purposes  meredith recorded the exchange as two simultaneous but separate events the sale of the two florida stations  for which a nonoperating gain was recognized  and the acquisition of the portland station  which was accounted for as an asset purchase 
the nonoperating gain on the sale of the florida stations was million million after tax  or cents per share  based on the fair value of the assets acquired million as determined by an independent appraisal 
the fair value of million was the purchase price of the portland station 
the operations of the acquired properties have been included in the company s consolidated operating results since their respective acquisition dates 
in june  meredith sold the stock of a wholly owned subsidiary that produced and sold calendars and books through annual programs 
the revenues and operating profits of the subsidiary were not material to the publishing segment or the company 
the sale resulted in a loss of million 
in may  meredith sold golf for women magazine to the golf digest companies  a subsidiary of advance magazine publishers  inc  effective with the first issue of fiscal the sale resulted in a nonoperating gain of million million after tax  or cents per share 
meredith also sold the assets of american park network  but the resulting gain was not material 
nonrecurring items in response to a weakening economy and a widespread advertising downturn  management took steps in fiscal to reduce the number of meredith employees  including a one time  voluntary early retirement program 
other selective workforce reductions were achieved through attrition  realignments  and job eliminations 
the company also recorded certain asset write downs 
these costs were partially offset by the reversal of certain accruals no longer deemed necessary 
in combination  the actions resulted in a fourth quarter nonrecurring charge of million million after tax  or cents per share 
expenses for retirement benefits  severance  and outplacement charges resulting from the employee reduction totaled million 
approximately positions were eliminated in fiscal and early fiscal more than percent of these costs were paid by june  the remaining accrual balance represents early retirement benefit costs and will be paid over the next five fiscal years 
the charge for asset write downs totaled million 
the charge included the write off of million in investments in internet related alliances after meredith ended its business relationships with two small internet companies 
a review of the fair value of the company s investments in those two businesses  which included examination of financial information they provided  resulted in the write off 
the remaining charges of million consisted primarily of costs associated with discontinuing family money magazine  mature outlook magazine  the shop online supplement  and the better homes and gardens television show 
the reversal of certain accruals reduced the nonrecurring charge by million 
these reversals came primarily from satisfying certain contractual obligations for less than accrued amounts 
new accounting standards meredith adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective july  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized to earnings but be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
the adoption of this standard substantially reduced meredith s amortization expense related to intangible assets and goodwill 
amortization expense totaled million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the majority of the amortization expense in fiscal resulted from the acquisition of the american baby group in december sfas no 
does not permit the restatement of prior years results 
the provisions of sfas no 
that pertain to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets not being amortized have superceded the impairment related provisions in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
under sfas no 
 the impairment review was based generally on future undiscounted cash flows 
under sfas no 
 the impairment review must be based on a fair value approach 
the estimated fair values of these assets are determined by developing discounted future cash flow analyses 
sfas no 
requires an initial review of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and another review later in the same fiscal year 
the company s initial review resulted in transitional impairment losses of million million after tax  or per diluted share 
the impairment losses reflect the write down of fcc television licenses network affiliation agreements million and goodwill at certain television stations million 
the majority of the impaired assets related to the acquisition of television station wgcl atlanta in march the charge was recorded net of tax as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal the subsequent annual review for impairment was performed as of may  no further adjustments were required as a result of that review 
use of non gaap financial measures financial measures included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap are referred to as non gaap financial measures 
while management believes these measures contribute to an understanding of the company s financial performance  they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
management uses and presents non gaap financial measures  along with gaap results  to evaluate and communicate the performance of the company and its segments 
management believes the non gaap financial measures provide an additional analytic tool to understand the company s results from core operations and underlying trends 
management believes that adjusted earnings calculations are helpful in making period to period comparisons because they eliminate the effect of certain accounting changes  as well as gains or losses on certain transactions 
meredith s primary use of non gaap financial measures relates to adjustments for amortization no longer required under sfas no 
 exclusion of nonrecurring and nonoperating items  and references to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda which also excludes nonoperating income expense and nonrecurring charges 
each section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reporting non gaap financial measures includes reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
the adoption of sfas no 
eliminated a significant amount of amortization related to intangible assets and goodwill 
because this elimination of amortization resulted from a change in accounting principle and did not reflect a change in the underlying performance of the business  management believes it is useful to present adjusted segment operating profit and adjusted earnings as if the amortization provisions of sfas no 
had been effective in all periods presented 
the adjusted earnings data do not reflect the after tax impairment loss of million that was recognized by the company upon the adoption of sfas no 
on july  and do not take into account impairment charges that may have been recorded had the company adopted this statement at an earlier date 
see new accounting standards for additional information about sfas no 
net earnings over the last three fiscal years have included nonrecurring charges and nonoperating items such as gains or losses on the sale of various businesses 
these items have had an impact on net earnings and are important to an understanding of the company s performance within that time frame 
since  however  these items typically relate to changes in the makeup of meredith s businesses or result from circumstances not expected to reoccur  management believes it is helpful to the understanding of the comparative performance of ongoing operations to present adjusted earnings excluding these items 
meredith s management uses ebitda along with operating profit and other gaap measures to evaluate the financial performance of the company s broadcasting segment 
ebitda is a common alternative measure of performance in the broadcasting industry and is used by investors  financial analysts  and ratings agencies 
these groups use ebitda and other measures to estimate the value of a business and to evaluate a company s ability to meet its debt service requirements 
the calculation of ebitda may vary between companies 
results of operations consolidated years ended june change change in millions except per share total revenues costs and expenses depreciation and amortization nonrecurring items total operating costs and expenses income from operations nonoperating expense income nm earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net earnings diluted earnings per share before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle diluted earnings per share nm not measurable revenues revenues increased percent in fiscal after declining percent in the prior fiscal year 
exclusive of the impact of the american baby group acquisition and adjusted for same station broadcasting revenues  fiscal revenues increased percent 
same station comparisons include revenues of kptv portland in all periods and exclude revenues of the two florida stations traded for kptv in june the increase in comparable revenues reflected higher advertising revenues  including million of political revenues at the broadcasting stations primarily in the first half of fiscal  and increased book sales 
these revenue increases were partially offset by slightly lower revenues from magazine circulation and integrated marketing operations 
the decline in fiscal revenues from the prior year largely reflected two factors the absence of revenues from operations that were discontinued late in fiscal and soft economic conditions 
on a comparable basis excluding discontinued publishing operations revenues declined percent 
the decline primarily reflected lower magazine and broadcasting advertising revenues 
advertising demand in both businesses had been weak in the months leading into fiscal  and the situation was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of september in addition  net political advertising revenues at the broadcasting stations declined million due to the biennial nature of election campaigns 
advertising demand slowly rebounded in the second half of the fiscal year 
fourth quarter fiscal advertising revenues grew percent following comparative declines in the first three quarters 
revenues from meredith s integrated marketing operations also declined in fiscal these declines were partially o ffset by higher circulation revenues 
operating costs operating costs and expenses increased percent in fiscal following a percent decline in fiscal fiscal operating costs and expenses included million in nonrecurring items see nonrecurring items 
when those items are excluded from the comparisons  fiscal costs were down percent from the prior year 
fiscal production  distribution  and editorial costs increased percent primarily due to the acquisition of the american baby group in december excluding american baby group costs  the company s production  distribution  and editorial costs increased percent  reflecting higher volumes in publishing and higher postal rates 
higher volumes resulted from an increase in the number of advertising pages and books sold 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased percent in fiscal the increase was percent  excluding american baby group costs  and primarily reflected higher performance based incentive accruals 
depreciation and amortization expenses declined percent in fiscal because of the significant amortization expense eliminated by the adoption of sfas no 
see new accounting standards 
excluding the impact of the new accounting standard  depreciation and amortization expenses increased percent due to the amortization of intangibles resulting fr om the american baby group acquisition and higher depreciation expense primarily from investments in digital technology equipment at the broadcasting stations 
fiscal production  distribution  and editorial costs decreased percent  reflecting the absence of costs for discontinued titles included in the prior year  volume related declines in manufacturing and paper costs  and lower paper prices 
partially offsetting these favorable variances were higher postal rates in publishing and higher amortization of broadcasting rights 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased percent in fiscal due to higher subscription acquisition costs  increased employee benefit costs  and higher unallocated corporate expenses 
these expense increases were partially offset by lower costs attributable to the absence of discontinued titles 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased percent in fiscal the company s workforce reduction program part of the nonrecurring charge recorded in fiscal was expected to result in the reduction of certain costs in fiscal the anticipated savings were achieved but  as expected  were largely offset by other cost increases  primarily in employee benefits and postage 
companywide compensation costs  excluding benefits  decreased percent in fiscal the average number of employees declined percent from fiscal income from operations income from operations increased percent in fiscal  reflecting growth in revenues  the decline in amortization expense resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
 and improved operating margins 
in fiscal income from operations declined percent 
income from operations in fiscal included million in nonrecurring charges 
excluding those charges  income from operations declined percent in fiscal fiscal results reflected the impact of weak advertising demand  especially following the september attacks 
nonoperating expense income nonoperating expense totaled million in fiscal and included a loss on the sale of a subsidiary million and the write off of an investment in a start up technology company million 
these charges were partially offset by a gain related to final post closing adjustments on the june exchange of two florida television stations for kptv portland million and proceeds from life insurance policies million 
fiscal nonoperating income totaled million  consisting of a noncash gain from the disposition of two television stations million and proceeds from the demutualization of an insurance company with which meredith holds policies million 
fiscal nonoperating income was million and represented a gain from the sale of golf for women magazine 
interest net interest expense was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal average long term debt outstanding declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the favorable effect of declining debt outstanding was partially offset by higher interest rates 
the company s approximate weighted average interest rate was percent in fiscal  percent in fiscal  and percent in the rate increases were a result of the april debt refinancing that converted million in variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and the effect of interest rate swap contracts 
fiscal interest expense also included a charge of million due to the discontinuation of hedge accounting for a portion of meredith s interest rate swap contracts 
as a result of the april debt refinancing  the notional amount of interest rate swap contracts exceeded the variable rate debt outstanding 
management determined it was probable the level of variable rate debt would not increase to allow utilization of these swaps over the term of the swap contracts  related amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss were therefore reclassified to earnings 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was percent in each of the past three fiscal years 
earnings and earnings per share net earnings were million per share in fiscal and included a charge of million per share for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of sfas no 
earnings before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle were million per share compared with net earnings of million per share in fiscal and million per share in fiscal the slight decrease in earnings before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal reflected the absence of the prior year s nonoperating gain on the swap of two florida television stations for kptv portland 
that absence was largely offset by improved results from the publishing and broadcasting businesses and a significant decline in amortization expense from the adoption of sfas no 
the percent net earnings increase reported in fiscal was largely attributable to the significant nonoperating gain recorded in that year  operating profits were down for both publishing and broadcasting

were effective july  see reconciliations of non gaap financial measures on page revenues publishing revenues increased percent in fiscal due to strong growth in advertising and book revenues and the acquisition of the american baby group 
excluding the american baby group  revenues increased percent 
publishing revenues declined percent in fiscal  reflecting weak advertising demand and the absence of revenues from discontinued operations 
adjusted for operations discontinued in fiscal  revenues declined percent in fiscal discontinued operations included golf for women  family money  and mature outlook magazines and the california tourism and american park network publications 
to enhance comparability  the following discussion excludes revenue from the american baby group and the discontinued titles 
comparable publishing advertising revenues increased percent in fiscal following a percent decline in fiscal the september  terrorist attacks and the resulting economic slowdown negatively affected advertising demand in fiscal the impact of the attacks and the slow recovery that followed was evident in quarterly results 
all first quarter fiscal issues were closed prior to september  and comparable advertising revenues were up percent for that quarter 
they were down percent in the second quarter  down percent in the third  and up percent in the fourth quarter 
improvement continued in fiscal with the year over year growth increasing in each quarter compared to the prior quarter 
the fiscal decline in advertising demand was widespread  affecting most categories of advertising and most of the company s titles 
management took steps to build market share during these difficult times  which contributed to the recovery in revenues in the second half of fiscal and in fiscal these steps included initiatives designed to capture a greater share of advertisers budgets  specific market share incentives for sellers  and a trade industry promotional program 
these efforts achieved notable market share gains 
the combined advertising revenue market share of better homes and gardens and ladies home journal in the women s service field was over percent in fiscal and has increased in each of the last two fiscal years 
country home and traditional home magazines also increased advertising revenue share with respect to competing titles in fiscal and fiscal comparable magazine circulation revenues decreased percent in fiscal following a percent increase in fiscal fiscal subscription revenues were affected by a slight decline in average revenue per copy for several titles due to an increase in the term of direct mail offers 
fiscal newsstand revenues increased from the prior year despite industrywide weakness in the second half of the fiscal year 
the industry downturn coincided with the us involvement in the conflict in iraq 
the growth in fiscal circulation revenues came primarily from increased newsstand sales of many titles  including better homes and gardens special interest publications  creative collection titles  and ladies home journal magazine 
subscription revenues increased in fiscal due to higher sales of newer titles such as more magazine and higher average prices for several titles 
the fiscal circulation revenue increase included a favorable adjustment to an accrual for ret ailer allowances resulting from the final settlement of a discontinued program 
excluding that adjustment  comparable circulation revenues increased percent in fiscal other publishing revenues increased percent in fiscal on a comparable basis 
this growth followed a percent decline in fiscal fiscal s growth was primarily the result of an increase in the volume of book sales 
book revenues increased percent largely due to the fall release of the th edition of the better homes and gardens new cook book and the spring release of a book based on the learning channel cable network s popular trading spaces decorating show 
fiscal revenues from book sales declined percent in part because of weak consumer demand following the september attacks 
a more significant factor in the decline in other publishing revenues in fiscal was lower sales volume in integrated marketing 
in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  fiscal  new integrated marketing business was insufficient to offset programs reduced or eliminated by existing clients 
integrated marketing new business sales improved significantly in fiscal  but  due to long lead times  revenues from most new programs will not be recorded until fiscal operating costs costs increased percent in fiscal after declining percent in fiscal excluding costs of the newly acquired american baby group in fiscal and amortization expense no longer required under sfas no 
in fiscal  costs increased percent in fiscal the increase in comparable costs reflected higher sales volume in advertising pages and books  higher postal rates  and higher payroll and employee benefit costs 
partially offsetting these increases were lower sales volume from integrated marketing  lower paper prices  and lower magazine subscription acquisition costs 
the fiscal decline reflected the absence of costs for discontinued titles  management s cost control initiatives  lower paper prices  and a smaller investment in interactive media operations 
partially offsetting these declines were higher postal rates and higher costs for employee benefits 
paper  printing  and postage costs of the magazine and book operations account for approximately percent of the publishing segment s operating costs 
as a result of weaker market demand for paper and newly negotiated vendor relationships  the company s average paper prices declined approximately percent in fiscal average paper prices remained steady early in fiscal and began to increase in the second half of the fiscal year 
because of the timing of the price changes  average paper prices were down approximately percent in fiscal paper prices are driven by overall market conditions and are difficult to predict  but management anticipates they will increase as paper demand grows during the next fiscal year 
postal rates for periodicals rose percent in june following increases of almost percent in july and nearly percent in january the postmaster general has stated that no further rate increases will be requested until at least meredith continues to work with others in the industry and through trade organizations to encourage the postal service to implement efficiencies and contain rates 
operating profit and adjusted operating profit publishing operating profit increased percent in fiscal following a percent decline in fiscal the adoption of sfas no 
effective july  eliminated much of the publishing segment s amortization expense for intangible assets and goodwill 
adjusted operating profit stated as if the amortization provisions of sfas no 
had been effective july  increased percent in fiscal major contributors were higher advertising revenues  increased book sales and operating profits  and lower paper prices 
they were partially offset by higher postal rates and increased employee costs 
the decline in fiscal adjusted operating profit was primarily a result of lower advertising revenues and lower integrated marketing sales 
the revenue decline was partially offset by lower operating costs 
broadcasting the following table presents operating results for the company s broadcasting segment  which consists of network affiliated television stations  including their interactive media operations 
years ended june change change in millions revenues advertising other total revenues operating profit adjusted operating profit operating profit is reported before nonrecurring charges of million in fiscal adjusted operating profit assumes the amortization provisions of sfas no 
were effective july  see reconciliations of non gaap financial measures on page revenues broadcasting revenues increased percent in fiscal following a percent decline in fiscal on june   meredith exchanged its orlando and ocala  fl television stations for kptv in portland  or 
the exchange negatively affected revenues in fiscal  but did not have a material effect on operating profits because of cost savings associated with the duopoly in portland 
on a same station basis  revenues increased percent in fiscal same station comparisons include revenues of kptv portland and exclude revenues of the two florida stations in all periods 
one factor in the revenue changes over the three year period was the impact of political advertising revenues associated with biennial election campaigns 
net political revenues totaled million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal political revenues displace a certain amount of nonpolitical advertising revenues and therefore are not entirely incremental 
excluding political advertising  same station broadcasting revenues increased percent in fiscal after being down percent in fiscal to build station revenues  management changes were implemented  programming procurement procedures were improved  newscasts were revamped  and sales practices were modified 
these initiatives contributed to ratings increases and revenue growth that exceeded industry averages 
fiscal revenues were affected not only by the absence of political revenues but also by an industrywide weakness in the demand for television advertising 
demand had begun to weaken in fiscal  and the terrorist attacks had an immediate worsening effect 
meredith s september advertising revenues  which had been pacing even with the prior fiscal year s  ended the month down percent 
part of the decline resulted from the uninterrupted news coverage the company s stations provided for several days following september and the postponement of the following weekend s sporting events 
the balance was caused by the dramatic slowdown in advertising following the attacks 
broadcasting revenues were down an average of percent in the first and second quarters of fiscal  rebounded to flat in the third  and rose percent in the fourth quarter 
operating costs operating costs declined percent in fiscal following a slight decline in fiscal the elimination of amortization expense for intangible assets and goodwill  effective with the adoption of sfas no 
on july   was the primary reason for the decline in operating costs in fiscal when fiscal costs are adjusted to exclude such amortization  operating costs were down percent in fiscal also affecting the cost comparisons were charges for the write down of broadcast rights to net realizable value of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal excluding the broadcast rights write downs  operating costs were down slightly in fiscal following a percent increase in fiscal the cost increase in fiscal reflected higher amortization of broadcasting rights and increased employee compensation costs 
operating profit and adjusted operating profit including the effect of no longer amortizing most intangible assets and goodwill  broadcasting operating profit increased percent in fiscal if the amortization provisions of sfas no 
had also been in effect in fiscal and  adjusted operating profit would have increased percent in fiscal following a percent decline in fiscal most of the fluctuation in adjusted operating profit is attributable to changes in advertising revenues 
supplemental disclosure of broadcasting ebitda meredith s broadcasting ebitda is defined as broadcasting segment operating profit plus depreciation and amortization expense 
ebitda is not a gaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gaap financial measures 
see discussion of management s rationale for the use of ebitda in use of non gaap financial measures 
broadcasting ebitda was as follows years ended june change change in millions ebitda see reconciliations of non gaap financial measures on page the ebitda margin  or ebitda as a percentage of segment revenues  was percent in fiscal  percent in fiscal  and percent in fiscal the fourth quarter of fiscal represented the fifth consecutive quarter of year over year improvement in this ratio 
unallocated corporate expenses unallocated corporate expenses are general corporate overhead expenses not attributable to the operating groups 
years ended june change change in millions unallocated corporate expense unallocated corporate expenses increased percent in fiscal following a percent increase in fiscal the increase in fiscal reflected higher performance based incentive accruals  higher employee benefit expenses and increased costs for professional services such as insurance and auditing fees 
the fiscal increase came primarily from higher consulting and pension expenses as well as costs to terminate an outsourcing contract 
the increase in consulting expenses stemmed from a review of vendor relationships and an analysis of opportunities for process improvements 
the increase in pension expense resulted from lower than expected returns on plan assets 
pension expense calculations use numerous assumptions 
if actual results differ from these assumptions  expense in future periods may increase or decrease 
the outsourcing contract termination has resulted in lower costs going forward 
reconciliations of non gaap financial measures the following tables provide reconciliations among segment operating profit  adjusted segment operating profit  and broadcasting segment ebitda a measure of segment earnings before depreciation and amortization 
broadcasting ebitda margin is defined as segment ebitda divided by segment revenues

effective adjusted segment operating profit other depreciation and amortization segment ebitda segment ebitda margin liquidity and capital resources years ended june change change in millions net earnings cash flows from operations cash flows from investing cash flows from financing net cash flows nm nm not measurable meredith s primary source of funds for operations is cash generated by operating activities 
debt financing is typically used for acquisitions 
the company s core businesses magazine and book publishing and television broadcasting have been strong cash generators 
despite the introduction of many new technologies such as the internet and cable and satellite television  management believes these businesses will continue to have strong market appeal for the foreseeable future 
as with any business  operating results and cash flows are subject to changes in demand for the company s products 
changes in the level of demand for magazine and television advertising and or other products can have a significant effect on cash flows 
historically  meredith has been able to absorb normal business downturns without significant increases in debt  and management believes the company will continue to do so 
management therefore expects that cash on hand  internally generated cash flow  and borrowings from credit agreements will provide funds for any additional operating and recurring cash needs eg  working capital  capital expenditures  and cash dividends into the foreseeable future 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million in fiscal  they decreased million in fiscal major factors affecting the change in cash usage included a percent increase in cash provided by operations  the acquisition of the american baby group  and the effect of that acquisition on the change in net debt outstanding during the period 
fiscal cash provided by operating activities grew to million from million in the prior fiscal year  reflecting an increase in earnings excluding the fiscal noncash charge for a change in accounting principle and the fiscal noncash gain from the television station swap for kptv 
also contributing to the increase in cash provided by operating activities were favorable changes in deferred income taxes and unearned subscription revenues partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the december acquisition of the american baby group for million was financed with million in debt from existing credit facilities and cash on hand 
debt outstanding decreased million in fiscal in spite of the debt incurred for the acquisition 
the company reported an million net decrease in debt outstanding during the previous fiscal year 
tax deductible contributions to qualified pension plans totaled million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal though not required to do so  the company expects to contribute approximately million to these plans in fiscal long term debt at june   long term debt outstanding totaled million 
it consisted of million under an asset backed commercial paper facility and million in fixed rate unsecured senior notes 
in april  meredith entered into a revolving agreement to sell all of its rights  title  and interest in the majority of its accounts receivable related to advertising  book  and miscellaneous revenues to meredith funding corporation  a special purpose entity established to purchase accounts receivable from meredith 
at june   million of accounts receivable  net of reserves  were outstanding under the agreement 
meredith funding corporation in turn sells receivable interests to an asset backed commercial paper conduit administered by bank one  na in consideration of the sale  meredith receives cash and a subordinated note that bears interest at the prime rate percent at june  from meredith funding corporation 
the revolving agreement is structured as a true sale under which the creditors of meredith funding corporation will be entitled to be satisfied out of the assets of meredith funding corporation prior to any value being returned to meredith or its creditors 
the accounts of meredith funding corporation are fully consolidated in meredith s consolidated financial statements 
the asset backed commercial paper facility has a capacity of up to million and renews annually in april 
meredith has the ability and the intent to renew the facility each year 
hence  the principal is reflected as due on april   the facility termination date 
the interest rate changes monthly and is based on a fixed spread over the average commercial paper cost to the lender 
the interest rate was percent in june the fixed rate unsecured senior notes are in amounts of million and million and are due from march  to april  interest rates range from percent to percent 
meredith has a revolving credit facility of million that expires on april  at june   borrowings made under the revolving credit facility were subject to an interest rate of 
this rate is variable based on libor and the company s leverage ratio 
no amount was borrowed under this facility at june  all of the company s debt agreements include financial covenants  and failure to comply with any such covenants could result in the debt becoming payable on demand

meredith uses interest rate swap contracts to manage interest cost and risk associated with possible increases in variable interest rates 
these contracts effectively fix the base interest rate on a substantial portion of the variable rate credit facilities  but the applicable margins vary based on the company s debt to ebitda ratio 
the swap contracts expire in june the average notional amount of indebtedness outstanding under the contracts was million in fiscal and will be million in fiscal the company is exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the contracts 
given the strong creditworthiness of the counterparties  management does not expect any of them to fail to meet their obligations 
the weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding at june   including the effect of hedged interest rate swap contracts  was approximately percent 
as a result of the debt refinancing completed in april and subsequent debt repayments  meredith had swap contracts that no longer met the qualifications for hedge accounting 
these swap contracts were deemed to be ineffective and dedesignated as hedge contracts 
before the dedesignations  expense related to fair market value adjustments on the swap contracts had been recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
upon the dedesignations  the loss was required to be amortized into earnings over the life of the swap contracts 
interest expense of million was recorded in fiscal for such amortization and changes in fair market value 
subsequent to the dedesignations  management determined that it was probable the level of variable rate debt would not increase to allow use of the dedesignated swaps over the term of the swap contracts 
therefore  million remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the dedesignated swap contracts was reclassified as interest expense in the fo urth quarter of fiscal changes in the fair market value of the dedesignated swap contracts resulted in a million reduction of interest expense in fiscal contractual obligations the following table presents the long term debt maturities  required payments under contractual agreements for broadcast rights and other purchase obligations  and future minimum lease payments under noncancelable leases as of june  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in millions long term debt broadcast rights operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations funds for meeting contractual cash obligations are expected to come from cash generated by future operating activities 
debt agreements may be renewed or refinanced if the company determines it is advantageous to do so 
contractual obligations for broadcast rights shown in the preceding table include million for broadcast rights that are not currently available for airing and are therefore not included in the consolidated balance sheet at june  meredith also has commitments in the form of standby letters of credit and other guarantees totaling million 
approximately half of the commitments expire within one year  the rest of them are long term 
share repurchase program meredith has maintained a program of company share repurchases for more than ten years 
in fiscal  the company spent million to repurchase an aggregate of  shares of meredith corporation common stock at market prices 
the company spent million to repurchase an aggregate of  shares in fiscal meredith has spent more than million on company share repurchases over the past three fiscal years and  subject to market conditions  expects to repurchase additional shares from time to time in the foreseeable future 
as of july   approximately  shares were authorized for repurchase 
the status of the repurchase program is reviewed at each quarterly board of directors meeting 
dividends meredith has paid quarterly dividends continuously since in february  the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend percent  or one half cent per share  to cents per share effective with the dividend payable on march  given the current number of shares outstanding  this increase will result in additional dividend payments of approximately million annually 
dividends paid in fiscal were million  or cents per share  compared with million  or cents per share  in fiscal capital expenditures expenditures for property  plant  and equipment were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the increase reflected higher spending for equipment and remodeling associated with the consolidation of the portland duopoly and for the initial transition to digital technology at five television stations 
the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
funds for capital expenditures are expected to come from operating activities or  if necessary  borrowings under credit agreements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk meredith is exposed to certain market risks as a result of its use of financial instruments  in particular the potential market value loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
all of the company s financial instruments subject to market risk are held for purposes other than trading 
long term debt at june   meredith had outstanding million in variable rate long term debt and million in fixed rate long term debt 
there are no material earnings or liquidity risks associated with the company s variable rate debt because of interest rate swap contracts that reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations by effectively converting variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the fair market value of the variable rate debt approximates the carrying amount 
there also are no earnings or liquidity risks associated with the company s fixed rate debt 
the fair market value of the fixed rate debt based on discounted cash flows reflecting borrowing rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities varies with fluctuations in interest rates 
a percent decrease in interest rates would have changed the fair market value of the fixed rate debt to million from million at june  interest rate swap contracts meredith has an interest rate swap contract outstanding that is designated as a cash flow hedge and effectively converts a portion of the company s variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
there are no earnings or liquidity risks associated with this swap contract 
the fair market value of the interest rate swap contract is the estimated amount based on discounted cash flows the company would pay or receive to terminate the swap contract 
a percent decrease in interest rates would have had no material effect on the million cost to terminate the swap contract at june  as a result of the april debt refinancing  meredith also has interest rate swap contracts outstanding that are no longer designated as hedges against variable rate debt obligations 
while there is no liquidity risk associated with these swap contracts  changes in interest rates expose the company to earnings risk because all changes in the fair market value of the swap contracts are recorded in interest expense 
at june   a percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the cost to terminate these swap contracts to million from million 
broadcast rights payable the company enters into broadcast rights contracts for its television stations 
as a rule  these contracts are on a market by market basis and subject to terms and conditions of the seller of the broadcast rights 
these rights generally are sold to the highest bidder in each market  and the process is very competitive 
there are no earnings or liquidity risks associated with broadcast rights payable 
fair market values are determined using discounted cash flows 
at june   a percent decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a million increase in the fair market value of the available and unavailable broadcast rights payable
