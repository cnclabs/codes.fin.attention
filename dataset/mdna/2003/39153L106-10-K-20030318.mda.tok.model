item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations and financial condition we are a leading developer and manufacturer of batteries  capacitors  filtered feedthroughs  engineered components and enclosures used in implantable medical devices 
we also develop and manufacture high performance batteries and battery packs used in other demanding non medical applications 
our medical battery revenues are derived from sales of batteries for pacemakers  implantable cardioverter defibrillators icds and other implantable medical devices 
our capacitor revenues are derived from sales of our wet tantalum capacitors  which we developed for use in icds 
our component revenues are derived from sales of feedthroughs  electrodes  electromagnetic interference emi filters  enclosures  and other precision components principally used in pacemakers and icds 
our commercial power sources revenues are derived primarily from sales of batteries and battery packs for use in oil and gas exploration 
we also supply batteries to nasa for its space shuttle program and other similarly demanding commercial applications 
a substantial part of our business is conducted with a limited number of customers 
our two largest customers accounted for approximately of revenues in we have entered into long term supply agreements with most of our large customers 
for each of our products  we recognize revenue when the products are shipped and title passes 
cost of revenues includes materials  labor and other manufacturing costs associated with the products we sell 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include salaries  facility costs  professional service fees  and patent related and other legal expenses 
research  development  and engineering costs include expenses associated with the design  development  testing  deployment and enhancement of our products 
we record cost reimbursements received for research  development and engineering conducted on behalf of customers as an offset to research  development and engineering expenses 
we utilize a fifty two  fifty three week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest december st 
for clarity of presentation  the company describes all periods as if the year end is december st 
fiscal included weeks

medical battery revenues increased mainly due to our customers increased demand for icd batteries 
partially offsetting this increase was a decline in royalty revenues from medtronic on patents that have expired 
capacitor revenues increased as a result of increased demand by our existing customer for capacitors 
the increase in sales of medical components was primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from greatbatch sierra during the full year of and greatbatch globe for the second half of substantially all of the revenue changes during were attributable to volume 
commercial 
commercial power sources revenues decreased principally due to a decreased level of exploration in the oil and gas industry in the first six months of compared to gross profit gross profit increased as a result of increased revenues 
production yield issues at greatbatch sierra  reduced royalty revenues in compared to  and the inclusion of lower margin greatbatch globe operations were the primary contributors to the reduced overall gross margin 
sg a expenses sg a expenses increased both in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues 
the increase is primarily due to the inclusion of costs associated with greatbatch sierra and greatbatch globe  costs associated with our six sigma tm quality initiatives  the general development of our infrastructure to support the company growth  and expenses related to ongoing patent activity 
rd e expenses rd e expenses increased in dollars  but as a percentage of total revenues were at the same level for both years 
the decrease in the percentage of expenses as related to sales is primarily attributable to the low level of rd e expenses at greatbatch globe 
we expect to maintain our spending on rd e at a level that will support the new technologies demanded by the implantable medical device markets 
amortization expense intangible amortization decreased significantly due to the cessation of the amortization for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives effective the beginning of our fiscal year if the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
had been implemented on january   income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for would have been million and  respectively 
if sfas no 
had been implemented on january   net income and diluted earnings per share for would have been million and  respectively 
other expenses the non recurring charge of million represents the write off of the noncompete agreement after the passing of mr 
fred hittman in september interest expense declined as a result of reduced interest rates during the year 
the rate reductions arose from reduced market rates as well as contracted rate reductions due to the reduction in leverage measurements during the year 
interest income increased slightly as the company s investable cash was higher in than due to the timing of its follow on public offering and the acquisition of greatbatch globe 
the non recurring charge of million represents the write off of the investment in an unrelated company based on an analysis of the financial viability of that company 
it was determined that the company s investment in the unrelated company had a fair value that is less than its carrying value 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate declined primarily as a result of increased research and development credits  as well as the benefits of state tax planning strategies  net of anticipated increased state taxes related to the greatbatch globe acquisition 
extraordinary loss the extraordinary loss in was associated with the restructuring of our long term debt and the related write off of deferred financing fees  a call premium paid  and loan discounts associated with the previous long term debt 
fiscal compared with fiscal medical 
medical battery revenues increased primarily due to higher demand for our icd batteries from our customers  both foreign and domestic 
this increase was partially offset due to the expiration of implantable power source patents on which we had been receiving royalty fees 
capacitor revenues increased primarily due to market acceptance and demand for the icds using our capacitor  which was first introduced in the fourth quarter of medical component revenues increased mainly due to the acquisition of greatbatch sierra in june  whose primary product line of emi filters for implantable devices complements our other component lines well 
substantially all of the revenue changes during were attributable to volume 
commercial 
the higher commercial power sources revenues were primarily related to the inclusion of revenues for a full year from our battery engineering  inc bei acquisition that was completed in august this acquisition  combined with our pre existing commercial business  allowed us to participate strongly in the increased demand for products used in oil and gas exploration activity  which was up sharply in gross profit the increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased efficiencies and cost leveraging based on the higher production volumes in over in addition  in there were substantial start up costs that accompanied the ramp up of capacitors to production volumes 
sg a expenses the increase in sg a expenses was due to the inclusion of such expenses from greatbatch sierra since its acquisition in june  a full year of expenses from bei in versus only five months in  a full year of public company expenses annual stock listing and registrar fees  investor relation expenses  etc  and increased training costs in support of our adoption of a six sigma tm quality initiative 
rd e expenses rd e increased in dollars  but declined as a percentage of total revenues 
this decrease was primarily due to the rapid growth in capacitor and commercial revenues and not to a decrease in our research and development initiatives 
other expenses the increase in intangible amortization primarily reflects the amortization of intangible assets that arose from our acquisition of greatbatch sierra 
interest expense declined as the result of the prepayment of million of senior debt using proceeds from our fall initial public offering 
the favorable terms of the refinanced debt in the first quarter of also reduced interest rates 
these favorable conditions were tempered by the additional borrowing of million during the last half of to finance the greatbatch sierra acquisition 
interest income increased as the result of the investment of proceeds from our follow on public offering in the last half of other expense for increased from levels 
losses on disposition of assets comprised the majority of the balance in these recurring items were offset in  when we sold  for a gain  interest rate cap agreements that were no longer needed due to the prepayment of our senior debt 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased slightly due to the effect of state taxes and available credits 
extraordinary loss senior and subordinated debt that remained outstanding at year end was refinanced in the first quarter the extraordinary charge related to the call premium and write off of fees and other expenses incurred to establish the original debt financing 
the extraordinary charge  net of tax  recorded in resulted from that year s prepayment of debt with proceeds from our initial public offering 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of short term liquidity is our working capital of million at december  combined with our unused million credit line with our lending syndicate 
over the past three years the cash we have generated from operations has been sufficient to meet our capital expenditure and debt service needs  other than for acquisitions  and we anticipate that this will continue for we believe our relationship with our lending syndicate is good and that additional short term financing would be available to us from the syndicate on reasonable terms if needed 
we anticipate higher than historical capital spending during as we build out our new medical battery manufacturing factory that we purchased during the fourth quarter of and invest in information technology and other infrastructure to support the current business level and anticipated organic growth 
the company regularly engages in discussions relating to potential acquisitions and has identified several possible acquisition opportunities 
the company currently does not have any commitments  understandings  or agreements to acquire any other business  however  the company may announce an acquisition transaction at any time 
at december  our capital structure consisted of our million credit facility and our million shares of common stock outstanding 
we have historically financed our acquisitions with proceeds from our debt arrangements and public stock offerings 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is a primary measure of our ability to utilize debt financing 
we believe that our historical growth in ebitda and our expectation that it will continue to grow in the future positions us well to access increased debt from commercial lenders if needed 
we are authorized to issue million shares of common stock and million shares of preferred stock 
the market value of our outstanding common stock since our ipo has exceeded our book value and the average daily trading volume of our common stock has also increased  accordingly  we believe that if needed we can access public markets to sell additional common stock  preferred stock  debt or convertible securities if conditions are appropriate in the public markets 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our operations 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement cost 
it also provides accounting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
we plan to adopt sfas no

 accounting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
revises the accounting for exit and disposal activities under emerging issues task force issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under the company s existing credit facility both the term loan and any borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at fluctuating market rates 
an analysis of the impact on our interest rate sensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical change in short term interest rates shows an impact on expected earnings of approximately million of higher or lower earnings  depending on whether short term rates rise or fall by 
the discussion and the estimated amounts referred to above include forward looking statements of market risk that involve certain assumptions as to market interest rates 
actual future market conditions may differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  the forward looking statements should not be considered projections of future events by the company
