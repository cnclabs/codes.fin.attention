item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to factors that have affected our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december   and certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis  you should also read our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
initial public offering of markwest energy partners  lp on may   markwest hydrocarbon contributed most of the assets  liabilities and operations of our midstream business to markwest energy partners  lp in exchange for  subordinated units  a general partner interest in the partnership  incentive distribution rights as defined in the partnership agreement  and million in cash which was used to pay down bank debt 
the partnership closed its initial public offering on that date selling  common units including the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option for gross proceeds of million and net proceeds after fees and expenses of million 
concurrent with its initial public offering the partnership borrowed million which is included as long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet of markwest hydrocarbon 
markwest energy partners limited partnership structure reduces our cost of capital thereby enhancing our ability to grow our midstream operations more efficiently 
as of december   we own a interest in markwest energy partners consisting of  subordinated units and a general partner interest 
through our ownership of the general partner of markwest energy partners  we control and operate markwest energy partners 
markwest hydrocarbon s consolidated financial statements  beginning may   reflect the consolidation of markwest energy partners  with the public unitholders interest being reflected as a minority interest in the statement of operations and balance sheet 
recent developments on march   markwest energy partners  our consolidated subsidiary  entered into an agreement to merge with pinnacle natural gas company and certain affiliates for approximately million 
the acquired assets  primarily located in texas  are comprised of a three lateral natural gas pipelines transporting up to bcf day of natural gas under firm contracts to power plants and b eighteen gathering systems gathering more than  mcf d 
the acquisition complements and expands markwest energy partners core fee based business  while providing geographic and customer diversification 
the acquisition will be financed primarily through borrowings under the partnership s credit facility  which was recently expanded by million 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net loss 
our net loss was million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december  in our exploration and production segment  revenue associated with our increased us production was moderated by lower average sales prices  increased depreciation  depletion and amortization offset income from our canadian operations 
in our gathering and processing segment  we had record production at our siloam fractionator despite a third party transmission and gathering company s employees strike  since concluded  and below average cold weather in appalachia starting late in however  volatile commodity prices in our marketing segment partially offset record production 
ngl products traded at a historically low relationship to crude oil during the third quarter of  which adversely impacted us in two ways 
first  on ngl product sales hedged by crude oil  losses on the crude oil sales contracts were not completely offset by increases in physical ngl product sales prices 
this caused us to experience million less in after tax revenue than had the historical relationship been realized 
second  we recorded a million after tax  non cash reduction to revenue for estimated ineffectiveness of fourth quarter and crude oil hedges of our ngl product sales 
based on historical regression analysis  our crude oil futures contracts are effective for hedge accounting treatment 
to calculate the current period ineffectiveness  we compared and will compare the futures market s value for existing crude oil futures contracts to the future value of the ngls hedged the resulting mark to market adjustment 
this charge will reverse in future quarters and be offset by actual realized ineffectiveness  if any  which may be of a greater or lesser amount 
exploration and production revenue 
exploration and production revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
revenue was higher in than in primarily due to production from the two canadian natural gas production companies acquired in august and our increased production through drilling in both canada and the us the effect of the increased production was somewhat moderated by lower average selling prices 
gathering  processing and marketing revenue 
gathering  processing and marketing revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
revenue was lower in than in primarily due to a decrease in the average ngl product sales price from our keep whole contract  or frac spread  business  net of volume increases  which accounted for approximately million of the overall decrease 
the average ngl sales price was per gallon for the year ended december   compared to per gallon for the year ended december   a decrease of per gallon  or 
we recognized a million hedging ineffectiveness charge in a decrease in gas marketing revenues  which accounted for approximately million of the decrease 
gas marketing revenues declined in as natural gas prices retreated from above average levels that existed in  more than offsetting volume increases 
a net million decrease from our michigan operations  primarily a function of the sales of an unusual amount of ngl products in the first quarter of purchased gas costs 
purchased gas costs were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
purchased gas costs were lower in primarily due to a decrease in our gas marketing cost of goods sold  which accounted for million of the overall decrease 
gas marketing costs declined in as natural gas prices retreated from above average levels that existed in  more than offsetting volume increases 
a net million decrease from our michigan operations  primarily a function of the sales of an unusual amount of ngl products in the first quarter of plant operating expenses 
plant operating expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
lease operating expenses increased principally due to our acquisition of two canadian natural gas production companies in august and our increased production through drilling in both canada and the us in transportation costs 
transportation costs were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
transportation costs increased principally due to our acquisition of two canadian natural gas production companies in august and our increased production through drilling in both canada and the us production taxes 
production taxes were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
production taxes increased principally due to our acquisition of two canadian natural gas production companies in august and our increased production through drilling in both canada and the us selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase primarily stems from a supporting our canadian operations  which were acquired in august  and b the incremental  public company costs from our consolidated subsidiary  markwest energy partners  which closed its ipo on may  depreciation and depletion 
depreciation and depletion were million for the year ended december   compared to million  for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was principally caused by the depletion of reserves through increased production from our canadian acquisition and our capital programs in canada and the us interest expense 
interest expense was million for both the years ended december  and write down of deferred financing costs 
we wrote off million in deferred financing costs as a result of the may  amendment of our credit facility which was completed concurrently with the ipo of our consolidated subsidiary  markwest energy partners and an earlier amendment 
gain on sale of non operating assets 
during november  we sold  of our subordinated units of markwest energy partners to a third party 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  exploration and production revenue 
exploration and production revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
revenue was higher in than in primarily due to our acquisition of two canadian natural gas production companies during august  accounting for million of the increase 
natural gas sales prices increased  accounting for million of the increase 
for our combined rocky mountain and michigan production  our average sales price was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in  an increase of per mcfe  or 
our combined natural gas production and sales from our rocky mountain and michigan properties increased during  accounting for million of the increase 
the increase in our production was a direct result of our ongoing capital program for our united states properties 
gathering  processing and marketing revenue 
gathering  processing and marketing revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
revenue was lower in than in primarily due to a decrease in the average appalachian ngl sales price  which accounted for approximately million of the overall decrease 
the appalachian average ngl sales price is based on both sales out of our siloam fractionator as well as our appalachian terminal outlets 
the appalachian average ngl sales price was per gallon for the year ended december   compared to per gallon for the year ended december   a decrease of per gallon  or 
a decrease in gas marketing revenues  which accounted for approximately million of the decrease 
gas marketing revenues declined in as natural gas prices and volumes sold decreased from above average levels that existed in purchased gas costs 
purchased gas costs were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
purchased gas costs were lower in primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of our appalachian replacement natural gas  which accounted for million of the overall decrease 
the average cost of our appalachian feedstock was equivalent to per ngl gallon for the year ended december   compared to per gallon for the year ended december   a decrease of per gallon  or 
a decrease in gas marketing cost of sales  which accounted for million of the overall decrease 
gas marketing cost of sales decreased principally due to a decrease in natural gas costs and volumes sold in plant operating expenses 
plant operating expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase is primarily attributable to our august canadian acquisition 
transportation costs 
transportation costs were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase is primarily attributable to our august canadian acquisition 
production taxes 
production taxes were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was principally attributable to our august canadian acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
depreciation and depletion 
depreciation and depletion were million for the year ended december   compared to million  for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was principally caused by a several appalachian expansion projects that commenced operations in and  and b the depletion of reserves through increased production from our canadian acquisition and our capital programs in canada  the rocky mountains and michigan 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
despite a significant increase in debt during due to our canadian acquisition  interest expense decreased due to decreasing interest rates throughout gain on sale of non operating assets 
we sold a non operating asset for a million gain in no significant non operating assets were sold in seasonality a portion of our revenue and  as a result  our gross margin  is dependent upon the sales prices of ngl products  particularly propane  and the purchase price of natural gas which fluctuate with winter weather conditions  and other supply and demand determinants 
the strongest demand for propane  which increases sales volumes  and the highest propane sales margins generally occur during the winter heating season 
as a result  we historically recognize a substantial portion of our annual income during the first and fourth quarters of the year 
liquidity and capital resources markwest hydrocarbon s primary sources of liquidity are cash flow generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
from time to time  our sources of funds are supplemented with proceeds from sales of a non core assets and operating leases used to finance support equipment 
in  we supplemented these sources through the ipo of markwest energy partners net proceeds of million  which was primarily used to pay down our debt and the sale of  subordinated units we owned in the partnership net proceeds of million 
we believe that cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and fund our required capital expenditures 
most of our future capital expenditures are discretionary 
in our exploration and production segment  future capital expenditures will be increased or decreased based on cash flow from operations and availability under our credit facility 
cash generated from operations in markwest hydrocarbon will depend on our operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing commodity prices and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
availability under our credit facility is based on our borrowing base  which is a function of our proved reserves which are impacted by production  our drilling results  and commodity prices  as well as our ngl marketing business s receivables and inventory levels 
in an effort to increase our ability to make future discretionary capital expenditures  we may elect to supplement cash flow generated from operations by raising additional equity  entering into strategic partnerships  entering into the sale leaseback of assets  the sale of non core assets  or some combination thereof 
as of december   exclusive of the partnership s credit facility discussed below  markwest hydrocarbon had borrowed million of the million available credit under its million credit facility 
our available credit increases or decreases with monthly changes in our ngl accounts receivable and inventory levels and our semiannual borrowing base re determination based on our proved reserves 
for the partnership  future acquisitions or projects are expected to be financed through a combination of debt and issuance of additional units  as is common practice with master limited partnerships 
the march pinnacle acquisition is expected to be financed thorough borrowings under the partnership s credit facility  which was recently expanded by million 
as of december   the partnership had borrowed million of the million available credit under its million credit facility 
the partnership s credit facility was expanded in march to million 
markwest hydrocarbon forecasts a baseline capital budget of million for  almost all of which is for exploration and production projects 
our baseline capital budget is principally discretionary and may change contingent upon a number of factors  including our results of operations and opportunities 
cash flow net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by operations increased during because represented the first full year of our canadian e p operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was almost the same amount as it was in favorable timing of cash flows from receivables and payables offset lower net income in net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was much higher in due to our acquisition of two related e p companies in canada 
net of cash acquired  we paid million for the acquisition 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities were million for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities in was primarily the result of using the proceeds from the partnership s ipo to pay down debt 
net cash provided by financing activities was much higher in principally due to borrowings used to purchase two canadian e p companies 
net cash used in financing activities was a result of  despite our extensive appalachian expansion  our ability to pay down our line of credit a modest amount because of strong cash flows from operations  which was a function of above average processing margins and record sales volumes in total contractual cash obligations a summary of our total contractual cash obligations as of december   is as follows payment due by period type of obligation total obligation due in due in due in thereafter in thousands long term debt   operating leases      total contractual cash obligations     credit facilities you should read note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for information on our financing facilities 
outlook cash flow generated from operations during the fourth quarter of was adversely affected by volatile commodity prices  including unusually high natural gas prices  and the effect of below average cold weather in the northeastern us both of these conditions prevailed into the first quarter of unusually high natural gas costs increase the cost of the replacement natural gas we must purchase to satisfy our keep whole contractual arrangements in appalachia 
although our rocky mountain and canadian natural gas production mitigates our natural gas price risk  the impact of our rocky mountain and canadian production was partially offset by the unfavorable basis differential between the rocky mountains canada and appalachia that existed into the first quarter of below average cold weather caused a many landowners to tap into the gathering systems upstream of markwest energy partners appalachian facilities and b increased the operational downtime of the partnership s facilities  both of which reduced throughput and revenues from our appalachian operations 
we expect cash flow from operations to benefit in from our us and canadian drilling programs and the new gas stream that began flowing in january when a new gatherer completed its connection into the existing transmission system upstream of the partnership s kenova processing plant 
we also expect cash flow from operations to increase as a result of markwest energy partners march acquisition of the pinnacle companies 
related parties you should read notes and of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for information regarding related parties 
critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
you should also read note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
reserve estimates our estimates of gas and oil reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas and oil that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable gas and oil reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future gas and oil prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover gas costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to an extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of gas and oil attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected there from may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our gas and oil properties and or the rate of depletion of the gas and oil properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the long lived assets  including related intangibles  of identifiable business activities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value for the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is greater than fair value 
for assets identified to be disposed of in the future  the carrying value of these assets is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if impairment is required 
until the assets are disposed of  an estimate of the fair value is recalculated when related events or circumstances change 
when determining whether impairment of one of our long lived assets has occurred  we must estimate the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset 
our estimate of cash flows is based on assumptions regarding the volume of reserves behind the asset and future ngl product and natural gas prices 
the amount of reserves and drilling activity are dependent in part on natural gas prices 
projections of reserves and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors 
any significant variance in any of our assumptions or factors could materially affect our cash flows  which could require us to record an impairment of an asset 
for a more complete discussion of these factors  you should read forward looking information included earlier in this form k 
factors that affect projections of reserves and future commodity prices are the same factors that could impact our results of operations 
commodity price risk management activities we account for price risk management activities based upon the fair value accounting methods prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments 
risk management activities include utilizing various hedging contracts and other derivatives to reduce volatility in our cash flow 
sfas no 
requires that we determine the fair value of the instruments we use in these business activities and reflect them in our balance sheet at their fair values 
however  changes in the fair value of our cash flow hedges are generally recognized in our income statement when the hedge is settled 
the determination of fair value for our hedging derivatives requires substantial judgment 
the fair values of our derivatives are based upon certain estimations and internal valuation techniques 
these estimations use various factors that include closing exchange prices on the nymex  over the counter quotations  correlation of the hedged items to the hedging instruments and basis location differences 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by market volatility and changes 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and applies to all goodwill and other intangibles recognized in the financial statements at that date 
under the provisions of this statement  goodwill will not be amortized  but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  a gain or loss is recognized on settlement 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  with respect to our exploration and production business  we generally are required to plug our gas and oil production wells when removed from service  and we anticipate recording a liability for such obligation in the first quarter of with respect to our midstream services  we have certain surface facilities with ground leases requiring us to dismantle and remove these facilities upon the termination of the applicable lease 
we anticipate recording a liability  if one can be reasonably estimated  for such obligations in the first quarter of in january  the fasb emerging issues task force released issue no 
 issues related to accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
the task force reached a consensus to rescind eitf issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  the impact of which is preclude mark to market accounting for all energy trading contracts not within the scope of fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the task force also reached a consensus that gains and losses on derivative instruments within the scope of statement should be shown net in the income statement if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes 
the consensus regarding the rescission of issue is applicable for fiscal periods beginning after december  we do not have any trading activities and did not account for any contracts as trading contracts in accordance with eitf issue no 
therefore  the eitf consensus to rescind eitf issue no 
will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of sfas nos 
 and  amendment of sfas statement no 
 and technical corrections  which is generally effective for transactions occurring after may  through the rescission of sfas nos 
and  sfas no 
eliminates the requirement that gains and losses from extinguishments of debt be aggregated and  if material  be classified as an extraordinary item net of any income tax effect 
sfas no 
made several other technical corrections to existing pronouncements that may change accounting practice 
sfas no 
did not impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in november  fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  was issued 
the accounting recognition provisions of fin are effective january  on a prospective basis 
they require that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
under prior accounting principles  a guarantee would not have been recognized as a liability until a loss was probable and reasonably estimable 
as fin only applies to prospective transactions  we are unable to determine the impact  if any  that adoption of the accounting recognition provisions of fin would have on our future financial position or results of operations 
in january of  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin  which requires the consolidation of certain variable interest entities  as defined 
fin is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january   and on july  for investments in variable interest entities acquired before february   however  disclosures are required currently if a company expects to consolidate any variable interest entities 
we do not have investments in any variable interest entities  and therefore  the adoption of fin is not expected to have an impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion should be read in conjunction with notes and of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we face market risk from commodity price variations 
we also incur credit risk  foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk 
commodity price risk overview our business produces products  natural gas and ngls  and provides services  gathering and processing of natural gas and the transportation  fractionation and storage of ngls 
our products are commodities that are subject to price risk 
commodity prices are often subject to material changes in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand  general economic conditions and other market conditions over which we have no control  like the weather 
our primary risk management objective is to manage our price risk  thereby reducing volatility in our cash flows 
our risk management activities generally fall into one of these categories i hedges of those risks not mitigated by our natural hedge discussed below  ii hedges to realize the economics of a transaction  like our canadian e p acquisition  and iii our exploration and production basis hedges 
our hedging approach uses a statistical method that analyzes momentum and average pricing over time  and various fundamental data such as industry inventories  industry production  demand and weather 
hedging levels may increase with capital commitments and debt levels and when above average margins exist 
we maintain a committee  including members of senior management  which oversees all hedging activity 
we utilize a combination of fixed price forward contracts  fixed for float price swaps and options on the over the counter otc market 
new york mercantile exchange nymex traded futures are authorized for use  but only occasionally used 
swaps and futures allow us to protect our margins because corresponding losses or gains in the value of financial instruments are generally offset by gains or losses in the physical market 
we enter otc swaps with counterparties that are primarily financial institutions 
we use standardized swap agreements that allow for offset of positive and negative exposures 
net credit exposure is marked to market daily 
we are subject to margin deposit requirements under otc agreements with non bank counterparties and nymex positions 
the use of financial instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when i sales volumes may be less than expected requiring market purchases to meet commitments  ii our otc counterparties could fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas  ngl  or crude oil or otherwise fail to perform  and iii when the trading relationship between crude oil and ngl products is outside historical levels 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  we are similarly insulated against decreases in such prices 
types of price risk within our exploration and production segment  our revenues are subject to natural gas price risk 
within our ngl marketing segment  our price risk varies by contract as well as by spot market prices 
our appalachian producers compensate us for providing midstream services under one of two contract types under keep whole contracts  we take title to and sell the ngls produced in our processing operations 
we also reimburse or keep whole the producers for the btu content of the ngls removed through the re delivery to the producers of an equivalent amount on a btu basis of dry natural gas 
keep whole contracts therefore expose us to ngl product price risk on the sales side and natural gas price risk on the purchase or reimbursement side 
under percent of proceeds contracts  we take title to the ngls produced in our processing operations  we sell the ngls to third parties and pay the producer a specified percentage of the proceeds received from the sales 
percent of proceeds contracts therefore expose us to ngl product price risk 
all of our michigan processing business is also governed by percent of proceeds contracts 
natural hedge and basis risk to the extent our natural gas production equals our keep whole requirements for purchasing natural gas in appalachia and there are no material differences in net prices  we have a natural hedge and our commodity price risk is substantially mitigated 
as of december   our equity natural gas production approximated of our keep whole natural gas purchase requirements  making us a net consumer of natural gas and subject to natural gas price risk 
however  we are exposed to basis risk 
our basis risk for natural gas stems from the geographic price differentials between our e p sales location san juan basin and alberta  canada and hedging contract delivery location nymex and our marketing purchase location appalachia and nymex 
we hedge our basis risk for natural gas 
as of december   our natural gas basis hedges were as follows table i hedged natural gas basis year ending december  mmbtu  mmbtu we are generally unable to hedge our basis risk for ngl products 
we have two different types of ngl product basis risk 
first  ngl product basis risk stems from the geographic price differentials between our sales locations and hedging contract delivery locations 
we cannot hedge our geographic basis risk because there are no readily available products or markets 
second  ngl product basis risk also results from the difference in relative price movements between crude oil and ngl products 
we may use crude oil  instead of ngl products  in our hedges because the ngl hedge products and markets are limited 
crude oil is highly correlated with certain ngl products 
natural gas price risk generally  we are an overall net consumer of natural gas as our keep whole contractual requirements for purchasing natural gas in appalachia currently exceed our natural gas production 
until such time this relationship reverses and we become a net producer of natural gas  we are limiting our e p hedges to either a obtaining futures prices that our models suggest are optimal or b realizing the economics of a transaction  like our canadian e p acquisition 
generally  we execute our strategy by either selling fixed for float swaps or utilizing costless collars 
as of december   we have hedged our combined canadian and rocky mountain natural gas volumes and prices as follows table ii hedged natural gas sales year ending december  mmbtu    mmbtu henry hub equivalent mmbtu reflects our hedged natural gas prices as if natural gas was sold at henry hub nymex 
also  within our marketing segment  for certain appalachian natural gas sales  as of december   we hedged  mmbtu at per mmbtu for ngl product price risk we hedge our ngl product sales by selling forward propane or crude oil 
as of december   we have hedged appalachian and stet ngl product sales as follows table iii hedged sales price for ngl products year ending december  markwest hydrocarbon  inc ngl volumes hedges using crude oil ngl gallons   ngl sales prices per gallon markwest energy partners  lp ngl volumes hedged using crude oil ngl gallons  ngl sales price per gallon ngl volumes hedged using propane ngl gallons  ngl sales price per gallon total ngl volumes hedged ngl gallons  ngl sales price per gallon under table iii  all projected margins or prices on open positions assume that both a the basis differentials between our sales location and the hedging contract s specified location and b the correlation between crude oil and ngl products  are consistent with historical averages 
in addition to these risk management tools  we utilize our ngl product storage facilities and contracts for third party storage to build product inventories during lower demand periods for resale during higher demand periods 
to the extent our appalachian natural gas purchase requirements exceed our e p natural gas production  we are simultaneously subject to ngl price risk on the sales side and natural gas price risk on the purchase side within our gpm business 
consequently  we may hedge our appalachian processing margin defined as revenues less purchased product costs by simultaneously selling propane or crude oil while purchasing natural gas 
however  as of december   we had no such hedges in place 
sensitivities our hedging program reduces our annual sensitivity to changes in ngl product sales prices 
in our marketing segment  net income would have been higher by million  lower by million and higher by million for the years ended december   and  respectively  if we had not hedged 
these figures consider only hedges of appalachian processing margin and do not reflect other decisions made concerning when to buy natural gas or store ngl production for sale in later months 
in our e p segment  without hedging  net income would have been lower by million  lower by million and higher by million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our annual sensitivities to changes in commodity prices considering our hedge position are as follows 
for every per mmbtu increase in the natural gas price  our gross margin defined as revenue less purchased product costs would decrease by million 
for every per barrel reduction in the crude oil price  or per gallon reduction in ngl prices  our gross margin would decrease by million 
credit risk counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations expose us to potential losses as a result of nonperformance 
we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe minimize overall credit risk 
such policies include the evaluation of a prospective counterparty s financial condition  collateral requirements where deemed necessary  and the use of standardized agreements  which facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty 
we also monitor the financial condition of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis 
in general  our risk of default by these counterparties is low 
however  we experienced a loss in as described below 
sfas no 
provides that hedge accounting must be discontinued on contracts when it becomes reasonably possible that the counterparty will default 
during the fourth quarter of  enron corporation and its subsidiaries enron filed for bankruptcy protection 
in response to this filing  we have terminated all derivative contracts where enron was the counterparty 
as a result  in we wrote off million of risk management assets related to our cash flow hedges offset by million of risk management liabilities related to our fair value hedges 
in addition  our contracts with enron provide for netting of amounts owed to each other and as such we have netted million in amounts payable to enron 
the net result of the above transactions was a charge of million to earnings in the fourth quarter in the case of discontinuing hedge accounting for cash flow hedges  sfas no 
provides the amount in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings in the periods of the forecasted transactions 
as such  we reclassified million and will be reclassifying million from other comprehensive income to revenue  net of million and million of deferred taxes for and  respectively 
while we enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings  it is nevertheless possible that additional losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business in canada and thus are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing and investing transactions 
we manage this risk in part through use of the canadian dollar component of our credit facility 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts or other similar financial instruments to manage this risk 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of our long term debt with floating interest rates 
we may make use of interest rate swap agreements expiring june  to adjust the ratio of fixed and floating rates in the debt portfolio 
as of december   we are a party to contracts to fix interest rates on million of our debt at compared to floating libor  plus an applicable margin 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on our debt would result in an increase in interest expense and a decrease in income before taxes of approximately million 
this amount has been determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate debt balances as of december
