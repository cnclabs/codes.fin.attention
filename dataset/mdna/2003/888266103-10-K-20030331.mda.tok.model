our revenues have grown internally and through our strategy of increasing our core competencies and expanding our customer base through acquiring government information technology companies as part of the general trend of the defense and government information technology industry consolidation 
our operating margins are affected by the mix of contract types cost reimbursement  fixed price or time and materials as well as by the mix of prime contracts versus subcontracts 
significant portions of our contracts are time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts

the financial risks under these contracts generally are lower than those associated with other types of contracts  and margins are also typically lower than those on fixed price contracts 
the us government also has awarded us fixed price contracts 
such contracts carry higher financial risks because we must deliver the products  systems or contracted services at a cost below the fixed price in order to earn a profit

on february   the company and titan capital trust the trust  our wholly owned subsidiary  issued million convertible preferred securities remarketable term income deferrable equity securities  or high tides at per security  for a total of million  with an over allotment exercised on february  for an additional million securities  for an additional million 
the trust used the proceeds from the sale of the high tides to purchase from the company convertible senior subordinated debentures  due february  the debentures have the same financial terms as the high tides 
the high tides will accrue distributions of per annum  with quarterly distributions to be paid in arrears on february  may  august and november  commencing may  the trust s ability to pay distributions on the high tides is solely dependent on its receipt of interest payments from the company on the debentures 
in the event that all high tides outstanding have not been redeemed  approximately five years after the issuance of the instruments  then the remaining high tides must be remarketed  which means that a remarketing agent will attempt to establish a new annual distribution rate  conversion price and redemption features for the high tides that are consistent with a price per high tides equal to of its liquidation preference and also are most favorable to the company 
the per annum rate will be applicable from the date of original issuance to  but excluding the reset date 
the reset date is any date a not later than february   or the final reset date  or  if the day is not a business day  the next succeeding day  and b not earlier than business days prior to february   as may be determined by the remarketing agent  in its sole discretion 
on or after the reset date  the applicable rate will be the term rate established by the remarketing agent based on the outcome of the remarketing 
the company can  on one or more occasions  defer the interest payments due on the debentures for up to consecutive quarters unless an event of default under the debentures has occurred and is continuing 
the holders of the high tides may convert each security into shares of common stock of titan at the rate of shares as adjusted for the surebeam spin off of common stock for each high tides equivalent to a conversion price of per share of common stock  compared to the initial conversion price of per share of common stock prior to the surebeam spin off 
the company may redeem the debentures in whole or in part  at any time on or after february  until but excluding the tender notification date  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures  declining to of the principal amount of the debentures on or after february   plus any accrued and unpaid interest  and after the reset date  in accordance with the term call projections  if any  established in the remarketing or  upon a failed final remarketing  on or after the third anniversary of the reset date at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of debentures  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
at december   deferred financing costs included in other assets related to this agreement were approximately million and are being amortized over the term of the agreement 
on december   our wholly owned subsidiary  titan africa  inc titan africa  in connection with its contract to build a satellite based telephone system for its customer  the national telephone company of benin  africa  entered into a loan facility agreement for up to billion francs cfa the currency of the african financial community  equivalent to approximately million us dollars  with a syndicate of five banks  with africa merchant bank as the arranger 
this medium term financing is a non recourse loan to titan africa which is guaranteed by the national telephone company of benin  africa and secured by the national telephone company s equipment and revenues related to the project 
the facility has a fixed interest rate of and will be repaid in seven equal semi annual payments from the net receipts of this project  or by the opt in the event that such receipts are not adequate to make these payments  which commenced on december  and were scheduled to end on december  the borrowings on this facility have been utilized to fund the subcontractor costs incurred by alcatel of france  a major subcontractor to this project 
the non alcatel equipment provided by titan africa was financed through arrangement with the opt whereby titan africa would be paid in seven equal semi annual installments  which commenced on december  due to the approximate six to nine month delay in the delivery of the system  which was impacted by the expansion of the original project to include increased gsm lines  increased capacity and capability of the vsat sites and an overall increase in lines in benin  the africa merchant bank and titan africa have collectively agreed to extend the due date of the semi annual principal payments until such time as the service revenues have achieved certain levels 
the terms of titan africa s agreement with the opt to pay for this receivable and further amounts include  among other things  a revenue sharing of total net receipts earned on this project for up to a period of years depending upon when the equipment has been paid for 
during  approximately million was collected on this receivable  and approximately million has been collected through march  as of december   approximately million was drawn on the loan facility  which has been reflected in non current liabilities of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
approximately million has been reflected in current assets of discontinued operations  related to the gross carrying amount due from the opt on the contract 
the million drawn on the facility reflects the amount that has been funded by the africa merchant bank to cover subcontract costs 
in october  we collected an million receivable from an african group related to the sale of a portion of our economic interest  net of all fixed equipment payments  in the revenue sharing of this project 
as of december   the carrying value  net of non recourse debt  due on this contract was approximately million 
titan is endeavoring to divest discontinued businesses through stock and asset sales  and is currently in negotiations with a number of potential buyers  including buyers interested in globalnet 
in the event that titan is unsuccessful in its endeavors specific to sell globalnet  titan may have to pay the remaining net liabilities and incur a net cash outlay of approximately million to shut down the business 
titan may also incur unforeseen liabilities if it decides to shut down globalnet 
there are no titan guarantees of debt  either directly or indirectly  associated with ivoire telecom or sakon or any other unconsolidated subsidiaries other than approximately million of equipment financing 
on october   titan adopted a definitive plan to spin off its majority owned subsidiary surebeam corporation in the form of a tax free dividend to titan stockholders within months from that date 
the plan involved filing a letter ruling request with the internal revenue service to obtain approval of the tax free distribution 
titan received a favorable ruling in may  and on august   titan s remaining ownership interest in surebeam was spun off to titan stockholders as a tax free dividend 
titan has purchased a world wide perpetual and exclusive  non royalty bearing license to use surebeam s intellectual property for all applications and fields other than the food  animal hide and flower markets for the following consideration a million senior secured line of credit  with customary financial  affirmative and negative covenants  the exchange of the million debt owed by surebeam to titan for additional shares of class b and class a common stock of surebeam  and a cash payment of million  with million paid at september  and four installments of million payable on each of march   june   september  and december  the company s million senior secured revolving loan commitment to surebeam provides for borrowings up to million in the second quarter of  up to million in the third quarter of and up to million per quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of  subject to the million limitation on borrowing 
the amount available for borrowing in the second  third and fourth quarters of is based upon surebeam s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the prior quarter as a percentage of the ebitda target in its annual operating plan 
if ebitda is less than of target ebitda  then the amount available is million  provided that no amounts are available unless surebeam covenants during the current quarter to limit its total operating expenses defined as research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses to million 
if ebitda is of target  then the amount available is million or of the quarterly maximum and for each percentage of ebitda above of target  the percentage of the quarterly maximum above will be increased pro rata 
to the extent surebeam does not fully borrow the maximum amount during any quarter of  the unutilized amount can be borrowed in the subsequent quarters 
as of the end of  surebeam had borrowed million on this facility 
on february   surebeam filed a form k with the securities and exchange commission wherein surebeam stated that they do not anticipate borrowing additional amounts on the credit facility during or during the remaining period that the credit facility is outstanding 
in addition  titan has guaranteed certain lease obligations of surebeam and surebeam is obligated to reimburse us for any payments we make under these guarantees 
any guarantee payments we make reduce amounts available for future borrowing under the credit agreement 
some of the guaranteed leases have longer terms than the credit facility 
if titan remains a guarantor at the maturity date for the credit facility  then surebeam will enter into a reimbursement agreement with titan covering the outstanding guarantees 
in relation to surebeam s strategic alliance with hawaii pride  titan has guaranteed up to the greater of surebeam s equity interest in hawaii pride which is currently zero  or of hawaii pride s million  year loan from its lender  web bank 
as of december   titan has guaranteed approximately million  or of the loan balance 
in the event hawaii pride defaults on the loan  titan may be obligated to cover any defaults on the entire outstanding balance of the loan 
in march  surebeam and titan entered into an agreement amending the credit agreement 
that amendment waived  subject to certain conditions  surebeam s obligation to use net proceeds from the sale of its equity securities to make mandatory payments under the credit agreement during the period of march through september in connection therewith  surebeam agreed to provide for certain change orders and the furnishing of maintenance services under the equipment services agreement between titan and surebeam executed in february titan and surebeam have entered into an exclusive contract for the purchase and sale of electronic beam accelerators through december  and related integration services through december  unless surebeam does not offer competitive pricing 
on july   we sold  shares of our common stock in a public offering  which included an over allotment of  shares  at a price of per share 
we received approximate aggregate proceeds from the offering of million  net of underwriters commissions  in july transaction expenses related to the offering were approximately million 
we used the net proceeds from this offering to fund acquisitions  capital expenditures and other investments 
in addition  certain titan stockholders sold  shares  including  shares from the exercise of options  from which we received proceeds of million 
our strategic goals include the continued funding of acquisitions and capital expenditures 
we plan to finance these requirements from a combination of sources  which include cash generation from our core businesses  our credit facility and potential cash generated from the disposal of discontinued businesses 
management believes that the combination of our existing cash  amounts available under our credit facility and cash flow expected to be generated from our operations will be sufficient to fund planned investments and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we could elect  or we could be required  to raise additional funds during that period and we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
additional capital may not be available at all  or may not be available on terms favorable to us 
any additional issuance of equity or equity linked securities may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
management is continually monitoring and reevaluating its level of investment in all of its operations and the financing sources available to achieve our goals 
long term debt and other commitments our contractual cash obligations as of december   including principal maturities of long term debt and other commitments  were as follows  excluding non recourse debt  contingent obligations and interest thereafter total in thousands long term debt senior credit facility other high tides other commitments operating leases capital leases total contractual cash obligations the high tides has a remarketing feature beginning approximately five years after the date of issuance 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for detailed information on the terms of this financial instrument 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
specifically  management must make estimates in the following areas allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
these reserves are based on potential uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  historical losses  our customers credit worthiness  changes in government funding on certain of our contracts and adjustments that may arise from audits by the defense contract audit agency dcaa of certain of our government contracts 
should a customer s account become past due  we generally will place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments and or services provided to that customer  minimizing further risk of loss 
the likelihood of a material loss to titan on an uncollectible account in our discontinued operations would be principally dependent on a deterioration in economic and or political conditions in a particular country  such as benin  africa  in which our receivables due from the government controlled phone company of benin may be impacted by such an event  or in the middle east  in which our receivables due from a government agency in the middle east  may be impacted by political conditions 
our accounts receivable balances include unbilled receivables which are comprised of work in process which will be billed in accordance with contract terms and delivery schedules  as well as amounts billable upon final execution of contracts  contract completion  milestones or completion of rate negotiations 
payments to us for performance on certain of our us government contracts are subject to audit by the dcaa  and are subject to government funding 
we provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from rate negotiations  audit adjustments  and or government funding availability 
to the extent that actual adjustments due to rate negotiations  audit adjustments  or government funding availability differ from our estimates  our provisions for doubtful accounts may be impacted 
due to a high degree of diversification in our government business  where any one contract accounts for no more than percent of our total annual revenues  the likelihood of a material loss to titan on an uncollectible account from this activity is not probable 
inventory 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
we review the components of our inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
the likelihood of any material inventory write downs is dependent on changes in competitive conditions  new product introductions by us or our competitors  or rapid changes in customer demand 
determining impairment losses on non marketable securities 
we evaluate our investment in non marketable securities taking into consideration the financial condition of the investee  the near term prospects of the investee  including the opportunities in the region and industry of the investee  changes in technology  and the progress of the investee in achieving operational milestones according to its operating plan 
we also evaluate various alternatives relative to realizing the value of our investment 
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our evaluation of whether there is a decline other than temporary include significant changes in the investee s ability to generate positive cash flow  a significant change in technology  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset or a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the investee depends 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value  fair value and estimated lives of our long lived assets and goodwill 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset  as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by the company 
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset s ability to generate positive cash flow  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends  significant changes in our strategic business objectives  utilization of the asset  and a significant change in the economic and or political conditions  particularly in which we have investments 
benefit plans 
we provide for limited postretirement medical benefit obligations of operations discontinued in prior years for former employees and for certain current senior executive officers 
accounting and reporting for the pension plans requires the use of assumptions for discount rates  expected mortality rates and estimated growth rates in medical and healthcare costs all assumptions our actuaries rely upon in preparing their estimates for us 
any materially different valuations for actuarial assumptions that are different from our current expectations could impact our accruals for these postretirement benefit obligations 
as the population that participates in these plans is limited  we do not believe changes in valuations would have a material impact on our provisions for these postretirement obligations 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income  the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in  and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize a portion of our revenue using the percentage of completion method  which includes revenues recognized as units are delivered  in accordance with statement of position sop total estimated costs are based on management s assessment of costs to complete the project based upon evaluation of the level of work achieved and costs expended to date 
to the extent that our estimated costs materially change  our revenues recorded under such contracts could materially be affected and could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future periods 
in  approximately of our revenues were generated by fixed price contracts  which are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method 
the remaining of our revenues in were generated by cost plus fixed fee contracts and time and material contracts  for which percentage of completion is not used  and revenues are generally recognized as work is performed and billed to the customer 
titan contracts with its government customers using various cost type contracts 
they include cost plus fixed fee  cost plus award fee  cost plus incentive fee with incentives based upon both cost and or performance  cost with no fee  and cost sharing contracts 
revenues and profits are recognized in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
and sop for award and incentive fee type contracts  we recognize the expected fee to be awarded by the customer at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the customer regarding our performance  including any interim performance evaluations rendered by the customer 
revenues are recognized under fixed price contracts based on the percentage of completion basis  using the cost to cost or units of delivery methods 
accounting for business combinations 
since february of  we have acquired two companies acs and averstar  that have been accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
to qualify for the pooling of interests method  criteria relating to the attributes of the combining companies prior to the combination  the manner of combining the companies and the absence of certain planned transactions after the combination must be met 
under the pooling of interests method  the value of the assets and liabilities of the combined companies are carried forward at their recorded amounts and the reported income for all periods prior to the combination are combined and restated as if the combination had occurred at the beginning of the period presented 
if the criteria for pooling of interests accounting treatment are not met  then the purchase method of accounting would have been applied 
under the purchase method of accounting  all assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their fair values at the date of the acquisition and results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
accounting for these two acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting would have resulted in materially different reported results 
in relation to our allocation of purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired and contingencies assumed in acquisitions accounted for as purchase transactions  management makes estimates of such amounts as the fair value of assets and contingencies assumed 
to the extent that the actual values or contingencies may differ from the estimates used  our allocation of purchase price may differ  which may result in a change to the amount of goodwill and or purchased intangibles 
principles of consolidation 
management evaluates its investment in each joint venture and investment on an individual basis for purposes of determining whether consolidation or the cost or equity method is appropriate  based upon management s evaluation of the level of our ability to retain and exercise control through decision making ability and exercise significant influence  as well as our equity ownership interest 
in the event that our ability to obtain control and exercise significant influence changes materially from management s evaluation in determining whether consolidation should occur  or whether or not the cost or equity method is appropriate  then our operating results could be materially impacted  either positively or negatively 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  and are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
the interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after january  the application of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
the interpretation requires certain disclosures in financial statements issued after january  if it is reasonably possible that the company will consolidate or disclose information about variable interest entities when the interpretation becomes effective 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to a all entities and b legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal operation of long lived assets  except for certain obligations of lessees 
this statement amends sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  management does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections as of april  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  sfas no 
rescinds sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which required that all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be aggregated  and if material  classified as an extraordinary item 
as a result of changes in the criteria  gains and losses from debt extinguishment are to be classified as extraordinary only if they meet the criteria set forth in apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
also requires that sale leaseback accounting be used for capital lease modifications with economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions 
the company does not expect implementation to have a significant effect on its results of operations 
however  the loss from the extinguishment of the company s credit facility of million  which was appropriately recorded as an extraordinary item in accordance with apb no 
 will be reclassified to income from continuing operations in when the company adopts sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
applies to costs associated with an exit activity including restructuring or with a disposal of long lived assets 
those activities can include eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts  and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
under sfas no 
 a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
under current rules  companies can record a liability for restructuring costs when a commitment to a plan of action is made 
sfas no 
will require a company to disclose information about its exit and disposal activities  the related costs  and changes in those costs in the notes to the interim and annual financial statements that include the period in which an exit activity is initiated and in any subsequent period until the activity is completed 
sfas no 
is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
under sfas no 
 a company may not restate its previously issued financial statements  and the new statement grandfathers the accounting for liabilities that a company had previously recorded under emerging issues task force issue titan does not intend to adopt sfas no 
until after december  risks relating to our business titan depends on government contracts for most of its revenues and the loss of government contracts or a decline in funding of existing or future government contracts could adversely affect titan s revenues and cash flows and titan s ability to fund its growth 
titan s revenues from us government business represented approximately of titan s total revenues in  approximately of titan s total revenues in and approximately of titan s total revenues in titan s us government contracts are only funded on an annual basis  and the us government may cancel these contracts at any time without penalty or may change its requirements  programs or contract budget or decline to exercise option periods  any of which could reduce titan s revenues and cash flows from us government contracts 
titan s revenues and cash flow from us government contracts could also be reduced by declines in us defense  homeland security and other federal agency budgets 
approximately of titan s revenue in was for products and services under contracts with various parts of the us navy  us air force or us army or with prime contractors to the us navy  us air force or us army 
although these various parts of the us navy  us air force or us army are subject to common budgetary pressures and other factors  titan s various us navy  us air force or us army customers exercise independent purchasing decisions 
however  because of such concentration of titan s contracts  titan is vulnerable to adverse changes in its revenues and cash flows if a significant number of titan s us navy  us air force or us army contracts and subcontracts are simultaneously delayed or canceled for budgetary or other reasons 
in addition to contract cancellations and declines in agency budgets  titan may be adversely affected by curtailment of the u 
s government s use of technology services and products providers  technological developments that impact purchasing decisions or titan s competive position 
these or other factors could cause us defense and other federal agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts  to exercise their right to terminate contracts or not to exercise options to renew contracts or limit titan s ability to obtain new contract awards 
any of these actions or any of the other actions described above could reduce titan s revenues and cash flows 
government audits of titan s government contracts could result in a material charge to titan s earnings and have a negative effect on titan s cash position following an audit adjustment 
titan s government contracts are subject to cost audits by the government 
these audits may occur several years after the period to which the audits relate 
if a cost audit were to identify significant unallowable costs  titan could have a material charge to its earnings or reduction in its cash position as a result of an audit  including an audit of one of the companies titan has acquired 
some of titan s acquired companies did not historically impose internal controls as rigorous as those titan imposes on the government contracts titan performs  which may increase the likelihood that an audit of their government contracts could cause a charge to titan s earnings or reduction in titan s cash position 
titan s operating margins may decline under its fixed price contracts if titan fails to estimate accurately the time and resources necessary to satisfy titan s obligations 
some of titan s contracts are fixed price contracts under which titan bears the risk of any cost overruns 
titan s profits are adversely affected if its costs under these contracts exceed the assumptions titan used in bidding for the contract 
in  approximately of titan s revenues were derived from fixed price contracts for both defense and non defense related government contracts 
often  titan is required to fix the price for a contract before titan finalizes the project specifications  which increases the risk that titan will mis price these contracts 
the complexity of many of titan s engagements makes accurately estimating titan s time and resources more difficult 
if titan is not able to retain its contracts with the us government and subcontracts under us government prime contracts in the competitive rebidding process  titan s revenues may suffer 
upon expiration of a us government contract or subcontract under a us government prime contract  if the government customer requires further services of the type provided in the contract  there is frequently a competitive rebidding process 
titan cannot guarantee that titan  or if titan is a subcontractor that the prime contractor  will win any particular bid  or that titan will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract 
further  all us government contracts are subject to protest by competitors 
the termination of several of titan s significant contracts or nonrenewal of several of titan s significant contracts could result in significant revenue shortfalls 
titan may be liable for penalties under a variety of procurement rules and regulations  and changes in government regulations could adversely impact titan s revenues  operating expenses and profitability 
titan s defense and commercial businesses must comply with and are affected by various government regulations that impact titan s operating costs  profit margins and its internal organization and operation of its businesses 
these regulations affect how titan s customers and titan do business and  in some instances  impose added costs on titan s businesses 
any changes in applicable laws could adversely affect the financial performance of the business affected by the changed regulations 
with respect to us government contracts  any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in contract termination  price or fee reductions or suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government 
among the most significant regulations are the following the us federal acquisition regulations  which comprehensively regulate the formation  administration and performance of government contracts  the us truth in negotiations act  which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations  and the us cost accounting standards  which impose accounting requirements that govern titan s right to reimbursement under certain cost based government contracts 
titan has extended credit to its former subsidiary  surebeam corporation  that it may lose if surebeam is not successful in establishing a market for irradiated food or otherwise experiences liquidity problems 
titan previously funded its spun off subsidiary  surebeam corporation nasdaq sure  through a million subordinated promissory note which it exchanged for equity of surebeam prior to the spin off 
titan completed the spin off of surebeam on august  in connection with the spin off and a transfer of intellectual property  titan extended a million senior secured revolving line of credit to surebeam that matures on december  the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of surebeam 
titan no longer has any influence or control over the management of surebeam 
if surebeam does not become profitable or is unable to service its debt for any reason  titan may be required to write off some or all of any amounts loaned to surebeam under this credit facility 
in addition  titan has guaranteed certain facility leases for surebeam  aggregating approximately million for lease terms through and guaranteed a bank loan in an amount up to the greater of surebeam s equity interest in surebeam s strategic alliance  hawaii pride  or of hawaii pride s million bank loan 
at december   titan had guaranteed approximately million  or of the loan balance 
in the event that hawaii pride defaults on the loan  titan may be obligated to cover any defaults on the entire outstanding balance of the loan 
in march  surebeam and titan entered into an agreement amending the credit agreement 
that amendment waived  subject to certain conditions  surebeam s obligation to use net proceeds from the sale of its equity securities to make mandatory payments under the credit agreement during the period of march through september in connection therewith  surebeam agreed to provide for certain change orders and the furnishing of maintenance services under the equipment services agreement 
titan also subleases to surebeam approximately  square feet used for a service center in sioux city  iowa as well as facilities in dublin  california  omaha  nebraska and saudi arabia 
if surebeam is unable to pay its lease obligations as they become due  titan may be using its cash to satisfy these obligations and may incur losses 
titan may not be able to recoup the net book value of its discontinued commercial businesses  including titan wireless and cayenta  through divestitures and may incur exit costs in excess of its accruals in connection with the divestiture or shut down of some or all of these businesses 
titan has decided to exit substantially all of its remaining commercial businesses  including titan wireless and cayenta  and to focus in the foreseeable future on its national security and civil government businesses 
at december   the total net book value of its discontinued businesses was million  including million in titan wireless net assets  primarily relating to receivables on its contract with the opt of benin of million and a receivable from a customer in nigeria for million  and its investment in globalnet  which is a net liability of approximately million 
titan is endeavoring to divest these businesses through stock and asset sales but may not be successful in recouping the book value of these assets 
to the extent that it is unsuccessful in selling the globalnet business  titan may have to pay the remaining net liability and incur a net cash outlay of approximately million as well as potential unforeseen liabilities to shut down the business 
in  titan accrued approximately million in exit charges for employment termination costs  contract and lease termination costs and other direct costs expected to be incurred in connection with the exit of these businesses 
as of december   there is approximately million remaining to be paid in and titan may incur cash expenses in excess of its exit charge accruals in connection with the divestiture or shut down of businesses of titan wireless  avercom and lincom wireless 
titan s failure to identify  attract and retain qualified technical and management personnel could adversely affect its existing businesses 
titan cannot guarantee that it will be able to attract and retain the highly qualified technical personnel  including engineers  computer programmers and personnel with security clearances required for classified work  or management personnel to supervise such activities that are necessary for maintaining and growing titan s existing businesses 
titan competes primarily for government contracts against many companies that are larger  better financed and better known than titan 
if titan is unable to compete effectively  titan s business and prospects will be adversely affected 
titan s businesses operate in highly competitive markets 
many of its competitors are larger  better financed and better known companies who may compete more effectively than titan can 
in order to remain competitive  titan must invest to keep its products and services capabilities technically advanced and compete on price and on value added to titan s customers 
titan s ability to compete may be adversely affected by limits on titan s capital resources and titan s ability to invest in maintaining and expanding its market share 
titan has completed numerous strategic acquisitions and may complete others  which could increase titan s costs or liabilities or be disruptive 
since january   titan has acquired government information technology businesses as part of titan s strategy of consolidating government information technology businesses 
several of the businesses that titan acquired had themselves acquired other businesses prior to their acquisition by titan 
titan may not be able to integrate successfully any acquired businesses without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial problems 
the acquisition and integration of new businesses involves risk 
the integration of acquired businesses may be costly and may result in a decrease in the value of titan s common stock for the following reasons  among others titan may need to divert more management resources to integration than titan planned  which may adversely affect titan s ability to pursue other more profitable activities  the difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations  integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures  titan may not eliminate as many redundant costs as titan anticipated in selecting its acquisition candidates  and one or more of titan s acquisition candidates also may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that titan failed to discover through its due diligence prior to the acquisition 
titan intends to continue to look for additional strategic acquisitions 
instability in the us securities markets and volatility in titan s common stock price may make acquisitions with titan s common stock more expensive 
titan may incur significant costs in protecting titan s intellectual property which could adversely affect titan s profit margins 
titan s inability to protect its patents and proprietary rights in the us and foreign countries could adversely affect titan s businesses prospects and competitive positions 
as part of titan s strategy  titan seeks to protect its proprietary technology and inventions through patents and other proprietary right protection in the us and other countries 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if titan is unable to obtain or maintain these protections  titan may not be able to prevent third parties from using its proprietary rights 
in addition  titan may incur significant expense both in protecting its intellectual property and in defending or assessing claims with respect to intellectual property owned by others 
titan assesses the strength of its patent and intellectual property protection for its technologies and products 
despite titan s assessments and titan s belief in the strength of its patent protection for particular technologies or products  titan s patents may not provide effective barriers to entry against competitors in the markets targeted by particular technologies and products because titan s competitors may develop competing technologies and products that do not infringe upon titan s patents 
titan also could choose to modify or abandon one or more planned or current products because of these assessments or actual or threatened claims by other companies 
titan is not certain that its pending patent applications will be issued 
titan also relies on trade secrets  proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive 
titan has taken measures to protect its trade secrets and know how  including the use of confidentiality agreements with titan s employees  consultants and advisors 
it is possible that these agreements may be breached and that any remedies for a breach will not be sufficient to compensate titan for damages incurred 
titan generally controls and limits access to  and the distribution of  its product documentation and other proprietary information 
titan also cannot guarantee that other parties will not independently develop titan s know how or otherwise obtain access to titan s technology 
the covenants in titan s credit facility restrict titan s financial and operational flexibility  including its ability to complete additional acquisitions  invest in new business opportunities  or pay down certain indebtedness 
titan s credit facility contains covenants that restrict  among other things  titan s ability to borrow money  make particular types of investments  including investments in titan s subsidiaries  make other restricted payments  limits the ability to pay down high tides  swap or sell assets  merge or consolidate  or make acquisitions 
an event of default under titan s credit facility could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
titan has pledged substantially all of its consolidated assets and the stock of titan s subsidiaries to secure the debt under titan s credit facility  excluding titan s foreign affiliates 
if the amounts outstanding under the credit facility were accelerated  the lenders could proceed against those consolidated assets and the stock of titan s subsidiaries 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on titan s business 
titan s credit facility also requires titan to maintain specified financial ratios 
titan s ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond titan s control  and titan cannot assure you that titan will meet those ratios 
titan also may incur future debt obligations that might subject titan to restrictive covenants that could affect titan s financial and operational flexibility or subject titan to other events of default 
titan s revenues could be less than expected if titan is not able to deliver components of systems or products as scheduled due to disruptions in its supply of products and components or services 
because titan s internal manufacturing capacity is limited  titan uses contract manufacturers 
while titan uses care in selecting its manufacturers  this arrangement gives titan less control over the reliability of supply  quality and price of products or components than if titan manufactured them itself 
in some cases  titan obtains products from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
for example  titan currently relies upon surebeam as an exclusive supplier of linear accelerators for its medical sterilization business  and surebeam  in turn  relies on one supplier for some of the key components used to manufacture surebeam s linear accelerators 
consequently  titan risks disruptions in its supply of key products and components if titan s suppliers fail or are unable to perform because of strikes  natural disasters  financial condition or other factors 
any material supply disruptions could adversely affect titan s ability to perform its obligations under its contracts and could result in cancellation of contracts or purchase orders  delays in realizing revenues  payment delays as well as adversely affect titan s ongoing product cost structure 
titan s business is subject to significant environmental regulation 
compliance costs  or any future violations or liability under environmental laws  could harm titan s business 
titan is subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations governing the use  storage and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes and imposing liability for the cleanup of contamination from these substances 
titan cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these substances or wastes  and  in the event of such an incident  titan could be held liable for any damages that result 
from time to time  titan has been notified of violations of government and environmental regulations 
titan attempts to correct these violations promptly without any material impact on titan s operations 
in addition  titan may be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future 
these costs  and any future violations or liability under environmental laws or regulations  could have a material adverse effect on titan s business 
titan s results of operations have historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  which could adversely affect the market price of its common stock 
titan s revenues are affected by factors such as the unpredictability of sales and contracts awards due to the long procurement process for most of its products and services  the potential fluctuation of defense  intelligence and civil agency budgets  the time it takes for the new markets titan targets to develop and for titan to develop and provide products and services for those markets  competition and general economic conditions 
titan s contract type product mix and unit volume  its ability to keep expenses within budgets  and its pricing affect its gross margins 
these factors and other risk factors described herein may adversely affect titan s results of operations within a period and cause titan s financial results to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 
consequently  titan does not believe that comparison of its results of operations from period to period is necessarily meaningful or predictive of its likely future results of operations 
it is possible that in some future quarter or quarters titan s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if so  the market price of titan s common stock may decline significantly 
anti takeover provisions in titan s certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law  as well as titan s shareholder rights plan  could discourage  delay or prevent a change of control that titan s stockholders may favor 
provisions in titan s certificate of incorporation  titan s bylaws and delaware law could make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a takeover attempt that titan opposes even if a change in control of titan would be beneficial to the interests of its stockholders 
these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of titan s common stock 
these provisions permit titan s stockholders to take action by written consent instead of at a meeting and to nominate directors or bring other business before stockholder meetings only if they comply with advance notice and other procedural requirements in titan s bylaws  authorize titan s board of directors  without stockholder approval  to issue up to  shares of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by titan s board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and prevent a takeover attempt  and prohibit titan from engaging in mergers and other business combinations with stockholders that beneficially own or more of titan s voting stock  or with their affiliates  unless titan s directors or stockholders approve the business combination in the prescribed manner 
in addition to the provisions described above  in titan s board of directors adopted a poison pill shareholder rights plan  which may further discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire titan which titan has not solicited or does not approve  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to titan s stockholders 
as a result  titan s stockholders who wish to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so 
under titan s rights plan  preferred share purchase rights  which are attached to titan s common stock  generally will be triggered upon the acquisition  or actions that would result in the acquisition  of or more of titan s common stock by any person or group 
if triggered  these rights would entitle titan s stockholders other than the acquiror to purchase  for the exercise price  shares of titan s common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price 
in addition  if a company acquires titan in a merger or other business combination not approved by the board of directors  these rights will entitle titan s stockholders other than the acquiror to purchase  for the exercise price  shares of the common stock of the acquiring company having a market value of two times the exercise price 
there may be volatility in the price of titan s common stock that impacts the price a stockholder may realize upon a sale of the common stock 
stock prices of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
the market price of titan s common stock may vary widely as a result of several factors  including united states government s information technology  defense and civil budgets and strategic priorities  budgetary constraints affecting us government spending generally  changes in fiscal policy  and government regulatory initiatives  announcements of technological innovations or new products by titan or its competitors  patent or proprietary rights developments  and general market conditions 
these factors could lead to a significant decrease in the market price of titan s common stock 
in  the market price of titan s common stock has ranged from a high of before adjustment for the tax free spin off of surebeam per share to a low of after the tax free spin per share
