recent developments in january  we acquired the assets of airjac drilling  a division of veritas dgc land  inc  a seismic drilling support company headquartered in new iberia  louisiana 
the aggregate purchase price was million cash plus certain other consideration see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in this acquisition we acquired the following types of equipment number of types of equipment units acquired highland drilling units water buggies aluminum marsh atvs airboat drilling units swamp atvs pullboats pontoon boats skid mounted drilling units general demand 
we receive our revenues from customers in the energy industry 
demand for our services is principally impacted by conditions affecting geophysical companies engaged in the acquisition of d seismic data 
the level of activity among geophysical companies is primarily influenced by the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies for seismic data acquisition activities 
a number of factors affect the decision of oil and gas companies to pursue the acquisition of seismic data  including i prevailing and expected oil and gas demand and prices  ii the cost of exploring for  producing and developing oil and gas reserves  iii the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  iv the availability and cost of permits and consents from landowners to conduct seismic activity  v local and international political and economic conditions  vi governmental regulations  and vii the availability and cost of capital 
the ability to finance the acquisition of seismic data in the absence of oil and gas companies interest in obtaining the information is also a factor  as some geophysical companies will acquire seismic data on a speculative basis 
during  with the reduction in the price of oil and gas  we began to experience a decrease in demand for our services 
in  the market experienced a rebound 
for the years ended december   and  our operating revenues were million  million  and million  respectively 
seasonality and weather risks 
our operations are subject to seasonal variations in weather conditions and daylight hours 
since our activities take place outdoors  on average  fewer hours are worked per day and fewer holes are generally drilled or surveyed per day in winter months than in summer months due to an increase in rainy  foggy  and cold conditions and a decrease in daylight hours 
results of operations the following discussion provides information related to the results of our operations 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended year ended december  december  operating revenue   operating expense   gross profit   general and administrative expenses   asset impairment and other charges operating income loss  interest expense   other income expense  income before taxes  income tax benefit expense income before minority interest   minority interest in loss of subsidiaries net income   accretion of preferred stock net income applicable to common and common equivalent shares  operating revenues increased  or million  from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to the aforementioned acquisition of the assets of airjac drilling and improved market conditions in the geophysical industry in as a result  drilling revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in drilling revenues was partially offset by a decline in revenues in our other divisions 
our newly formed permitting division reported revenues of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period of survey revenues decreased from million for the year ended december  to zero for the year ended december  this decline is attributable to our decision to concentrate our personnel  equipment and available working capital on the more profitable segments of the seismic industry 
aviation revenues decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as we continued to reduce our seismic aviation fleet in order to concentrate on the more profitable offshore market 
operating revenues are expected to increase in as demand for our services continues to improve 
operating expenses increased  or million  from million in to million in operating payroll expense increased million from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in seismic activity resulted in a corresponding increase in the amount of personnel employed 
the average number of field employees was in and in also  as a result of the increased activity levels in as compared to  explosives expenses and repairs and maintenance expenses increased million and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in rental expense and related insurance expense on leased aviation equipment from to the decrease in rental expense resulted from the refinancing of our aviation fleet in december our aviation fleet was previously operated under an operating lease 
insurance expense declined as we reduced the size of our aviation fleet dedicated solely to support our seismic drilling operations 
while operating expenses are expected to continue to increase in as operating revenues increase  we expect these expenses to remain in line with revenues 
gross profit increased  or million  from million to million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
further  our gross profit margin improved from in to in the increase in gross profit margin is a result of increased business activity in our more profitable business segments  improved utilization of our equipment and personnel for the services provided and more stringent controls over operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for compared to million for payroll expenses accounted for million of this increase as administrative payroll costs increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase is principally attributable to an increase in the average number of administrative employees between the periods 
during we realized savings in certain general and administrative costs by renegotiating lease and vendor agreements with more favorable terms than those in preceding years 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase slightly in due to increased business activity 
during  we recorded asset impairment charges of million see note compared to million in interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was principally attributable to increased debt levels resulting from our decision to acquire our aviation fleet in december that was previously operated through an operating lease 
other income decreased million between the year ended december  and the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the receipt of million in proceeds from a key man life insurance policy in procured on the life of our founder and former ceo 
he was killed in a private aircraft accident in february for the year ended december   losses incurred by us generated an additional net operating loss carryforward for which a reserve has been provided see note  resulting in income tax expense of in the company reversed million of this related reserve due to the company s expectation of generating income in fiscal accretion of preferred stock decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to the accretion of dividends at during the free dividend period from april through june  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended year ended december  december  operating revenue   operating expense   gross profit loss   general and administrative expenses   asset impairment and other charges  operating loss  interest expense   other income expense   income loss before taxes   income tax benefit expense income loss before minority interest   minority interest in loss of subsidiaries net income loss   accretion of preferred stock net income loss applicable to common and common equivalent shares   operating revenues increased  or million  from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to an upswing in the seismic market in as a result  drilling revenues doubled from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our newly formed permitting division reported revenues of million for the year ended december  with no revenues reported for the corresponding period of survey revenues decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to our decision to concentrate our personnel  equipment and available working capital on the more profitable segments of the seismic industry 
aviation revenues decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as we continue to reduce our seismic aviation fleet to concentrate on the more profitable offshore market 
operating revenues in are expected to continue to increase due to an increased demand for our services 
operating expenses increased  or million  from million in to million in operating payroll expense increased million from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the significant increase in seismic activity has resulted in a corresponding increase in the amount of personnel employed  as the average number of field employees has increased to in compared to in also  as a result of the increased activity levels in as compared to  explosives expenses increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  contracting services increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  principally as a result of the commencement of our newly formed permitting division 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in the repairs and maintenance expense  rental expense and related insurance expense on leased aviation equipment 
the decreases resulted from fewer helicopters being leased from third parties during compared to depreciation expense and property and casualty insurance expense decreased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  because of an overall reduction in our operating equipment 
operating expenses are expected to continue to increase in as operating revenues increase 
gross profit increased million  or  from a gross loss of million to a gross profit of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is a result of increased business activity in our more profitable business segments  increased prices received for the services provided and more stringent controls over operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million for compared to million for payroll expenses accounted for of this decrease as they decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease is due to a reduction in the average number of administrative employees between the periods  as well as significantly reduced base compensation levels of our management 
we realized approximately million in savings during by renegotiating certain lease and vendor agreements with terms more favorable to us than those agreements in we experienced a million reduction in each of entertainment and communications expenses from the year ended december  to the year ended december  amortization expense decreased million from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively  due to the asset impairment charges realized in the latter part of see note 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase slightly in due to increased business activity 
during  we realized asset impairment charges of million see note compared to million in interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  other income increased million from a loss of million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily from the receipt of million in proceeds from a key man life insurance policy procured on the life our ceo  who was killed in a private aircraft accident in february the increase was also due to million of net losses on the sale of assets in offset by million in interest income in for the year ended december  and  losses incurred by us generated additional net operating loss carryforwards for which a reserve has been provided see note  resulting in income tax benefit expense of in each year 
accretion of preferred stock increased million from for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to the accretion of dividends at during the free dividend period from april through june for our preferred stock 
liquidity and capital resources to meet the capital requirements of the increasing market demand for our services  during the second half of fiscal and the first half of fiscal  we significantly improved our capital structure and available liquidity 
in late  we successfully raised million in new private equity 
in early we received million in key man life insurance proceeds 
with the new equity and the life insurance proceeds  we initiated a program to restructure our senior and subordinated credit facilities 
during  and  we privately placed a total of million  million and million  respectively  in subordinated debentures with an affiliate 
the debentures accrued interest at per annum or a rate commencing at per annum and escalating over the life of the note to a maximum of per annum 
the debentures matured five years from the date of their issuance with interest payable quarterly 
detachable from these debentures  were warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the warrants vested over four years and with exercise prices from ranging from to 
we recorded each warrant at its relative fair value at date of issuance 
in july  we factored with an affiliate and with recourse to us  approximately million of trade receivables of a major customer 
the receivable had become ineligible under the terms of our revolving credit facility 
in exchange for transferring ownership rights and title in the trade receivable of this customer  the affiliate forgave approximately million of the subordinated debt 
the amount was factored at a discount charge of of the amount advanced against the trade receivables transferred 
as of december  we have received of the million factored amount due 
the remaining million is classified as amounts due to affiliate 
in addition  we borrowed million from this affiliate during as of december   million remained outstanding 
we are currently finalizing repayment terms with the affiliate of all of the remaining outstanding balances 
the loan is secured by the amounts due from certain customers 
as more fully described below  during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we dramatically improved our financial position with the successful raise of million of new equity and the receipt of million in proceeds from a key man life insurance policy 
with the proceeds we repaid approximately million of senior secured indebtedness

we extended the maturity dates for all of our senior secured indebtedness  and negotiated a fixed interest rate reduction on approximately million of our senior secured debt 
on october   we completed the private placement of approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million 
in addition  the purchasers of the common stock received options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
further  in the event of the death of our founder and then ceo  the terms of the private placement permitted the private equity shareholders to put their stock back to us for the amount of their investment 
to secure the private equity shareholders right to put the acquire common stock  we purchased a million key man life insurance policy on the life of our founder and then ceo 
in addition  we issued to an affiliate shares of series a preferred stock for million in cash and converted approximately million of subordinated debt into  shares of series a preferred stock 
this conversion reduced the amount of subordinated debentures outstanding at december  to million 
with the completion of these capital transactions  we reached agreements to extend the maturity dates of approximately million senior secured debt 
the proceeds of the october private placement of stock were used to repay million of secured indebtedness  complete the acquisition of gulf coast resources  inc and provide working capital 
on february   our founder and then ceo  was killed in a private aircraft accident 
as a result  we received million in insurance proceeds from the key man insurance policy purchased in connection with the aforementioned private placement 
the private placement shareholders waived their right to put their stock back to us 
in connection with the receipt of these waivers  we also obtained commitments from our senior secured lenders to modify the then existing credit agreements 
under the terms of these revised commitments  the maturity dates were extended and interest rates were reduced from prime plus to prime plus 
with the proceeds we paid million of our senior secured term indebtedness and we reached an agreement with an affiliate  the holder of our outstanding subordinated debt to convert our remaining outstanding subordinated debt into million of series b preferred stock 
under the terms of this agreement  we paid the holder of our outstanding subordinated debt  million in satisfaction of million of indebtedness and issued  shares of series b preferred stock in full satisfaction of the remaining unpaid subordinated debentures 
in september  we entered into a million senior credit facility with a bank including a million working capital revolving line of credit the line and a million term loan 
the proceeds were used to repay term debt  refinance our revolving line of credit and provide working capital 
at december   we had approximately million in cash on hand as compared to approximately million at december  at december   we had working capital of approximately million as compared to approximately million at december  the increase in working capital is due to increased profitability  improved cash flow generated by our operations and the impact of our debt restructuring efforts 
cash provided by operating activities was million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
income provided from our operations was the single largest contributing factor in both years 
availability under the line is the lower of i million or ii the sum of of eligible accounts receivable  plus the lessor of of the cost of eligible inventory or of the appraised orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory of parts and supplies 
the line accrues interest at the prime interest rate plus at december  and matures on august  the line is collateralized by accounts receivable and inventory and is subject to certain customer concentration limitations 
as of december  we had million outstanding under the line and additional borrowing availability of million 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving lines of credit was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   we also had outstanding approximately million in other senior secured debt including approximately million with an equipment finance company 
this loan amortizes over seven years bears interest at libor plus  is secured by seismic drilling equipment and matures in july further  at december  we had approximately million outstanding to an aviation equipment finance company 
this loan is secured by the aviation fleet  amortizes over ten years  accrues interest at per annum and matures january our real estate is financed with a bank with payments amortized ten years  bearing interest at prime plus and matures in august at december   the balance outstanding under our real estate loan was million 
historically  our capital requirements have primarily related to the purchase or fabrication of new seismic drilling equipment and related support equipment  additions to our aviation fleet and new business acquisitions 
in  we acquired the assets of airjac drilling see notes and and approximately million of new vehicles accounted for as a capital lease 
in we expect to continue renewing our rolling stock  expanding our aviation fleet and continuing to pursue various strategic acquisitions 
at this time  we have no material commitments outstanding for expenditures nor do we anticipate acquiring a significant amount of capital assets in contractual commitments we have the following contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than after total year years years long term debt     capital lease obligations total contractual cash     in addition to the obligations described above  we also have a revolving line of credit  which is secured by our accounts receivable and inventory 
the line of credit matures on august  the balance outstanding on the line of credit was million at december  we periodically finance insurance policies on a short term basis 
as of december   million was outstanding for various polices financed with maturity dates ranging from june to september we believe that cash flow generated from operations in will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs  satisfy our debt service requirements and fulfill our capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cautionary statements this annual report contains forward looking statements 
such statements include  without limitation  statements regarding our expectations regarding revenue levels  profitability and costs  the expected results of our business strategy  and other plans and objectives of management for future operations and activities 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include  without limitation  our dependence on activity in the oil and gas industry  risks associated with our rapid growth  dependence on a relatively small number of significant customers  seasonality and weather risks  the hazardous conditions and difficult terrain in which we operate  and risks associated with our international expansion 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
related party transactions during the year ended december   we leased a facility from an affiliate

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation on our consolidated financial statements 
we extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
we regularly review outstanding receivables  and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established reserves  we make judgments regarding the parties ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful account may be required 
due to the nature of our industry  we have a concentration of credit risks 
as a result  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be significant 
we have made significant investments in inventory to service our equipment 
on a routine basis  we use judgments in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
technological innovations  market activity levels and the physical condition of products primarily influence our estimates 
changes in these or other factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of our net assets 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
we have established reserves to reduce our net deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value 
if tax regulations change  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
in making this determination we have considered future income in assessing the ultimate recoverability of the recognized net deferred tax asset 
we record liabilities for environmental obligations when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates are based on currently enacted laws and regulations 
as more information becomes available or environmental laws and regulations change  such liabilities may be required to be adjusted 
additionally  in connection with acquisitions  we obtain indemnifications from the seller related to environmental matters 
if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their obligations  adjustments of recorded amounts may be required 
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
we retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and self funded insurance programs 
we regularly review estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required
