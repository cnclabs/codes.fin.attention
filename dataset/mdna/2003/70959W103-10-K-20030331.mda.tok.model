item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we are a holding company whose assets consist primarily of the direct or indirect ownership of the capital stock of our operating subsidiaries

also  pursuant to the automobile franchise agreements to which our dealerships are subject  all dealerships are required to maintain a certain amount of working capital  which could limit our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends 
any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements  restrictions under any existing indebtedness and other factors the board of directors deems relevant

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
general we are the second largest publicly traded automotive retailer in the united states as measured by total revenues 
as of december   we owned and operated franchises in the us and franchises internationally  primarily in the uk as an integral part of our dealership operations  we retail new and used automobiles and light trucks  operate service and parts departments  operate collision repair centers and sell various aftermarket products  including finance  warranty  extended service and other insurance contracts 
new vehicle revenues include sales to retail customers and to leasing companies providing consumer automobile leasing 
used vehicle revenues include amounts received for used vehicles sold to retail customers  leasing companies providing consumer leasing and other dealers 
we generate finance and insurance revenues from sales of warranty policies  extended service contracts  other insurance policies  and accessories  as well as from fees for placing finance and lease contracts 
service and parts revenues include fees paid for repair and maintenance service  the sale of replacement parts and body shop repairs 
our gross profit tends to vary with the mix of revenues we derive from the sale of new vehicles  used vehicles  finance and insurance products  and service and parts services 
our gross profit generally varies across product lines  with new vehicle sales usually resulting in lower gross profit margins and our other products resulting in higher gross profit margins 
factors such as seasonality  weather  cyclicality and manufacturers advertising and incentives may impact the mix of our revenues  and therefore influence our gross profit margin 
our selling expenses consist of advertising and compensation for sales department personnel  including commissions and related bonuses 
general and administrative expenses include compensation for administration  finance  legal and general management personnel  depreciation  amortization  rent  insurance  utilities and other outside services 
a significant portion of our selling expenses are variable  and a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses are subject to our control  allowing us to adjust them over time to reflect economic trends 
floor plan interest expense relates to floor plan financing  which represents indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of new and used vehicle inventories 
other interest expense consists of interest charges on all of our interest bearing debt  other than interest relating to floor plan financing 
we have acquired a number of dealerships in and each of these acquisitions has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  our financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired dealerships from the date of acquisition 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant amount of judgment 
such judgments influence the reported amounts of the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in the company s consolidated financial statements 
management  on an ongoing basis  reviews estimates and assumptions 
if management determines  as a result of its consideration of facts and circumstances  that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate  our results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements may change significantly 
following is a summary of the accounting policies applied in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that management believes are most dependent upon the use of estimates and assumptions 

table of contents finance and insurance revenue recognition the company arranges financing for customers through various financial institutions and receives a commission from the lender equal to the difference between the interest rates charged to customers over the predetermined interest rates set by the financing institution 
the company also receives commissions from the sale of various insurance products to customers  including credit  life  and health insurance policies and extended service contracts 
the company receives fee income from the placement of these contracts at the time the customer enters into the contract 
the company is not the obligor under any of these contracts 
in the case of finance contracts  a customer may prepay  or fail to pay  thereby terminating the contract 
customers may also terminate extended warranty contracts with the underlying warranty provider  which are fully paid at purchase  and become eligible for refunds of unused premiums 
if the customer terminates a retail finance contract or cancels an extended warranty or other insurance product prior to scheduled maturity  a portion of these fees may be charged back to us based on the relevant terms of the contracts 
the revenue we record relating to these fees is net of an estimate of the ultimate amount of chargebacks we will be required to pay 
such estimate of ultimate chargeback exposure is based on our historical chargeback expense arising from similar contracts  including the impact of refinance and default rates on retail finance contracts and cancellation rates on extended warranty contracts and other insurance products 
the actual amount of historical chargebacks has not been significantly different than our estimates 
intangible assets the company adopted sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which require that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method  eliminated the pooling of interests method of business combinations  and eliminated amortization of indefinite lived intangible assets effective january  intangible assets on the company s balance sheet principally includes franchise value  which represents the estimated value of franchises acquired in business combinations consummated subsequent to july   and goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of tangible and identified intangible assets acquired arising in connection with business combinations 
the company believes that both franchise value and goodwill have indefinite lives 
all other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
sfas no 
also requires testing for possible impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles on an annual basis or when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
the value ascribed to intangibles acquired in connection with business combinations  the evaluation of indicated impairment  as well as the estimation of writedowns resulting from testing in connection with indicated impairment  are subject to management s judgment and estimates

historically  we have financed such capital expenditures with borrowings under our credit agreements  floor plan arrangements  and cash flow from operations 
in the past  we have also entered into sale leaseback transactions with automotive group realty  llc agr  a wholly owned subsidiary of penske corporation 
we sold certain properties to agr in for consideration of million and made lease payments to agr totaling million during the year ended december   which payments relate to the properties we lease from agr 
we believe we will continue to finance certain capital expenditures in this fashion in the future 
funding for such capital expenditures is expected to come from cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our credit agreements 
in connection with an acquisition of dealerships completed in october  the company agreed to make a contingent payment in cash to the extent  shares of common stock issued as consideration in connection with that acquisition are sold subsequent to the fifth anniversary of the transaction and have a market value of less than per share at the time of sale 
the company will be forever released from this guarantee in the event the average daily closing price of the company s common stock for any day period 
table of contents subsequent to the fifth anniversary of the transaction exceeds per share 
in the event the company is required to make a payment relating to this guarantee  such payment would result in the revaluation of the common stock issued in the transaction  resulting in a reduction of additional paid in capital 
the company has further granted the seller a put option pursuant to which the company may be required to repurchase no more than  shares for per share on each of the first five anniversary dates of the transaction 
as of december   the maximum of future cumulative cash payments the company may be required to make in connection with the put option amounted to million 
to date  no payments have been made by the company relating to the put option 
the company also has obligations with respect to past acquisitions totaling approximately million over the next three years 
in connection with an acquisition of dealerships completed in october  the company agreed that if the acquired companies achieved aggregate specified base earnings levels in any of the five years beginning with the year ending december   we would pay to the sellers for each year in which the acquired companies exceeded base earnings an amount equal to million plus defined percentages of the amounts earned in excess of such base earnings for any such year 
the total amount of payments to be made pursuant to this agreement is limited to million 
to date we have paid million relating to this agreement 
the amount of additional payments  if any  will be determined based upon the financial performance of the acquired business in payments relating to this earnings contingency are recorded as additional cost of the acquired dealerships  resulting in an increase in goodwill 
as of december   we had approximately million of cash available to fund operations and future acquisitions 
in addition  as of march   million and million was available for borrowing under the us credit agreement and the us credit facility  respectively 
availability under the us credit agreement is not currently limited by the credit agreement s borrowing base collateral limitation in general  the borrowing base equals certain of our allowable tangible assets plus million 
borrowings used to finance the cost of domestic acquisitions and domestic capital construction projects will typically increase tangible assets  allowing the company to access borrowing capacity which is currently not available due to the base collateral limitation in the us credit agreement 
we are a holding company whose assets consist primarily of the direct or indirect ownership of the capital stock of our operating subsidiaries 
consequently  our ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute earnings and other advances and payments to us 
the minimum working capital requirement under our franchise agreements could in some cases restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions  although to date we have not faced any such restrictions 
our principal source of growth has come from acquisitions of automotive dealerships 
we believe that our cash flow provided by operating activities and our existing capital resources  including the liquidity provided by our credit agreements and floor plan financing arrangements  will be sufficient to fund our current operations and commitments for the next twelve months 
to the extent we pursue additional significant acquisitions  we may need to raise additional capital either through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities or through additional bank borrowings 
we may not have sufficient availability under our credit agreement to finance significant additional acquisitions 
in certain circumstances  a public equity offering could require the prior approval of several automobile manufacturers 
there is no assurance that we would be able to access the capital markets or increase our borrowing capabilities on terms acceptable to us  if at all

cyclicality unit sales of motor vehicles  particularly new vehicles  historically have been cyclical  fluctuating with general economic cycles 
during economic downturns  the automotive retailing industry tends to experience similar periods of decline and recession as the general economy 
we believe that the industry is influenced by general economic conditions and particularly by consumer confidence  the level of personal discretionary spending  fuel prices  interest rates and credit availability 
seasonality our business is modestly seasonal overall 
our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  demand for cars and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the united states where dealerships may be subject to harsh winters 
accordingly  we expect our revenues and profitability to be generally lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters 
the greatest seasonalities exist with the dealerships we operate in the northeastern and upper mid western united states  for which the second and third quarters are the strongest with respect to vehicle related sales 
the service and parts business at all dealerships experiences relatively modest seasonal fluctuations

effects of inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation over the last few years have not had a significant impact on revenues or profitability 
we do not expect inflation to have any near term material effects on the sale of our products and services 
however  there can be no assurance that there will be no such effect in the future 
we finance substantially all of our inventory through various revolving floor plan arrangements with interest rates that vary based on the prime rate or libor 
such rates have historically increased during periods of increasing inflation 
we do not believe that we would be placed at a competitive disadvantage should interest rates increase due to increased inflation since most other automotive dealerships have similar floating rate borrowing arrangements

important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include the following automobile manufacturers exercise significant control over our operations and we depend on them in order to operate our business  because we depend on the success and popularity of the brands we sell  adverse conditions affecting one or more automobile manufacturers may negatively impact our revenues and profitability  if we are unable to complete additional acquisitions and successfully integrate acquisitions  we will be unable to achieve desired results from our acquisition strategy  we may not be able to satisfy our capital requirements for making acquisitions and financing the purchase of our inventory  our failure to meet a manufacturer s consumer satisfaction requirements may adversely affect our ability to acquire new dealerships  our ability to obtain incentive payments from manufacturers and our profitability  automobile manufacturers impose limits on our ability to issue additional equity and on the ownership of our common stock by third parties  which may hamper our ability to meet our financing needs  our business and the automotive retail industry in general are susceptible to adverse economic conditions  including changes in consumer confidence  fuel prices and credit availability  substantial competition in automotive sales and services may adversely affect our profitability  automotive retailing is a mature industry with limited potential in new vehicle sales  if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel  our business could be adversely affected  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to seasonality in the automotive retail business and other factors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the interest rates on a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
outstanding balances under our us and us credit agreements bear interest at a variable rate based on a margin over libor  as defined 
based on the amount outstanding as of december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our annual interest expense 
similarly  amounts outstanding under floor plan financing arrangements bear interest at a variable rate based on a margin over defined libor or prime rates 
based on an average of the aggregate amounts outstanding under our floor plan financing arrangements  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our annual floor plan interest expense 
the company continually evaluates its exposure to interest rate fluctuations and follows established policies and procedures to implement strategies designed to manage the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding at any point in time in an effort to reduce the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the company s earnings and cash flows 
the company is currently party to swap agreements pursuant to which a notional 
table of contents million of our floating rate debt was exchanged for fixed rate debt through january and a notional million of our floating rate debt was exchanged for fixed rate debt through march interest rate fluctuations effect the fair market value of our fixed rate debt  including the notes  certain seller financed promissory notes and obligations under certain capital leases  but do not impact our earnings or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company currently has operations in the uk and brazil and has investments in germany and mexico 
in each of these markets  the local currency is the functional currency 
due to the company s intent to remain permanently invested in these foreign markets  we do not hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
other than the uk  the company s foreign operations are not significant 
in the event we change our intent with respect to the investment in any of our international operations  the company would expect to implement strategies designed to manage those risks in an effort to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on the company s earnings and cash flows 
in common with other automotive retailers  we purchase certain of our new vehicle and parts inventories from foreign manufacturers 
although we purchase the majority of our inventories in the local functional currency  including the us dollar  our business is subject to certain risks  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility which may influence such manufacturers ability to provide their products at competitive prices in the local jurisdictions 
our future results could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors
