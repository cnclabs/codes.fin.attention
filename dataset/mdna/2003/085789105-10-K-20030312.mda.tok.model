item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information on the results of operations for each of the three years ended december   and and the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december  and the financial statements and the notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
the profitability of the company s operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to the average realized prices of oil  gas and electricity sold  the type and volume of oil and gas produced and electricity generated and the results of acquisition  development  exploitation and exploration activities 
the average realized prices for natural gas and electricity will fluctuate from one period to another due to regional market conditions and other factors  while oil prices will be predominantly influenced by world supply and demand 
the aggregate amount of oil and gas produced may fluctuate based on the success of development and exploitation of oil and gas reserves pursuant to current reservoir management 
the cost of natural gas used in the company s steaming operations and electrical generation  production rates  labor  maintenance expenses and production taxes are expected to be the principal influences on operating costs 
accordingly  the results of operations of the company may fluctuate from period to period based on the foregoing principal factors  among others 
results of operations the company earned million  or per share  in on revenues of million  up from million  or per share  on revenues of million in  but were lower than million  or per share  on revenues of million earned in  berry s most profitable year 
the increase in income in versus was due to higher production  lower interest expense and the recovery of million  which represented a portion of electricity receivables written off in  partially offset by higher operating costs

in  and  respectively 
boe d barrels of oil equivalent per day operating income from oil and gas operations was million in  down from million in  and million in the decrease from was due primarily to higher operating costs  partially offset by higher production 
oil and gas production boe d for was  higher than  in  but lower than  in production volumes declined dramatically in  reaching a low of approximately  boe d in mid due to the curtailment of steaming operations early in as a result of the california electricity crisis 
steaming operations were re established by august of and the company exited with a production level of approximately  boe d 
steam injection rates of  to  barrels of steam per day were maintained for all of this effort combined with the effects of the drilling program resulted in production rate improvement throughout the year with an exit rate of approximately  barrels per day for december the company plans to continue with significant drilling and development projects in with a goal of averaging  boe d in and exiting this year at  boe d 
the average sales price boe for the company s crude oil was  down from in and from in posted oil prices for the company s degree heavy crude oil began the year at and escalated steadily to at december  and have escalated further since year end to a price of on february  over of the company s crude oil has been contracted with a single customer until december  and is sold at prices based upon the higher of the average local field posted prices plus a fixed bonus  or wti minus a fixed differential 
from time to time  the company enters into crude oil hedge contracts  the terms of which depend on various factors  including management s view of future crude oil prices and the company s future financial commitments 
this price protection program is designed to moderate the effects of a severe price downturn while allowing berry to participate in the upside after a maximum per barrel payment 
the hedge can be in the form of a swap or an option 
the company has utilized bracketed zero cost collars as they meet the company s objectives of retaining significant upside while being adequately protected on a significant downside price movement 
additionally  the company utilizes more than one counterparty on its hedges and monitors each counterparty s credit rating 
the company s current hedging program is designed to hedge approximately to of its net production while retaining some upside on the hedged barrels in the event of a major price increase 
these price protection activities resulted in a net cost benefit bbl to the company of  
and in  and  respectively 
electricity prices relative to the cost of natural gas to generate such electricity in were very weak for the entire year 
the company produced approximately of its power for sale on the open market and received an average of mwh for that portion of total electricity sales and per mwh overall 
in january  berry began delivery of electricity under three reformed or reinstated standard offer contracts with pacific gas and electric company and southern california edison company  which should result in improved electrical pricing and contribute to lower operating costs for the company s crude oil production operations during these contracts are scheduled to terminate no later than december  management will pursue extensions or other longer term contracts at competitive rates for and beyond 
berry s fourth contract  which is based on a fixed electricity sales price until july  and then a short run avoided cost formula  expires in march to protect a portion of the company s electrical production from low off peak power prices  the company entered into fixed price sale swap agreements on mw of off peak power from october through may of at prices ranging from to mwh 
operating costs in were million  or per boe  up from million in  or per boe and comparable to million in  or per boe 
the primary reason for the increase from was higher steam costs 
steam costs increased due to higher volumes of steam from conventional generators  weak electricity prices at the company s cogeneration facilities and the suspension of steaming for a portion of in addition to higher steam costs  well work increased by 
million in due to the higher steaming activity and increased efforts to bring more marginal producers on line to capture revenue from improving oil prices 
in early  natural gas prices increased to over mmbtu and the company has selectively reduced steam injection approximately  bspd 
management anticipates that operating costs will increase to an average of approximately to per boe for dd a in was million  or per boe  equivalent to million  or per boe in  but higher than million  or per boe  in the increase from was primarily related to a higher asset base due to the cumulative effect of development activity in recent years 
the company is projecting dd a in  on a boe basis  to be approximately to per boe 
g a expenses in were million  or per boe  up and from million  or per boe  in and million  or per boe  in the increase from was primarily related to higher costs to evaluate potential acquisitions and rental and other costs associated with the company s bakersfield headquarters office 
the company is targeting g a of approximately per boe in interest expense in decreased to million  or 
per boe  from million  or 
per boe  in early in  the company drew down its line of credit to compensate for large unpaid receivables from electricity sales in late and early later in and early in  most of the receivables were recovered and long term debt was reduced from a peak of million to million at december  long term debt was further reduced in through internally generated funds to a balance of million at december  the company experienced an effective tax rate of in  up slightly from the reported in  but down from reported in the low effective tax rate is primarily a result of significant enhanced oil recovery eor tax credits earned by the company s continued investment in the development of its thermal eor projects  both through capital expenditures and continued steam injection volumes 
this is the fifth consecutive year that the company has achieved an effective tax rate below versus the combined federal and state statutory rate of 
the company believes it will continue to earn significant eor tax credits and have an effective tax rate well below the statutory rate in in  berry adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the company has recorded the estimate costs for the ultimate abandonment of its wells and facilities for many years under sfas no 
and the effect of the change on net income was immaterial 
the effect on net income in under the newly adopted method will be a pre tax charge of approximately 
million compared to a pre tax charge of approximately 
million under the previous method 
the most significant effect of the change was to move the current accumulated financial obligation to a long term liability account 
the value of this obligation under our previous method had been recorded as a reduction to the total book value of the company s property  plant and equipment 
the accrued abandonment obligation at december  was million 
the recorded abandonment obligation at december  under the previous method of million was reclassified to a long term liability in the current year presentation for comparability purposes 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was negative million  down from million at december  and negative million at december  net cash provided by operations in was million  up from million in  but lower than million in cash generated was used to fund million in capital expenditures  million in leasehold acquisitions  pay dividends of million and reduce long term debt by million 
total capital expenditures incurred excluding acquisitions in were million  up from million in included in this year s projects was the drilling of wells  of which were horizontal and the completion of workovers 
the company also made facility improvements totaling million on its producing assets 
these projects were responsible for a large portion of the production gains made in and should continue to contribute to production increases in and beyond 
the company also acquired acreage in kansas and illinois in for the purpose of exploring for economic concentrations of coalbed methane 
at december   approximately  acres in kansas and  acres in illinois were leased at a cost of approximately million 
in  the company drilled producing and one water disposal well and one well was returned to production on a pilot in illinois and producing wells and water disposal well were drilled in another pilot in kansas 
additional wells may be completed in kansas in the evaluation of these projects is expected to continue through most of the company has continued to maintain its million revolving bank facility with approximately million available for potential acquisitions or other purposes at december  the company has budgeted million  excluding property acquisitions  in capital projects for this program  on a net well basis  consists of net vertical wells  horizontal producers and workovers 
in addition to drilling and workover activities  million in facilities are scheduled for completion on the company s core properties 
one of the focuses of the budget is to continue to develop the proved but undeveloped reserves from the company s placerita properties 
in august  the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase million of common stock in the open market 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares for approximately million 
in  there were no additional shares repurchased under this program  however  the company did purchase and cancel an outstanding warrant for  shares 
at year end  the company had no subsidiaries  no special purpose entities and no off balance sheet debt 
the company did not enter into any significant related party transactions in critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those amounts 
a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires management to make difficult subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical policies  accounting for oil and gas reserves  environmental liabilities  income taxes and asset retirement obligations 
oil and gas reserves include proved reserves that represent estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the oil and gas reserves are based on estimates prepared by independent engineering consultants and are used to calculate dd a and determine if any potential impairment exists related to the recorded value of the company s oil and gas properties 
the company reviews  on a quarterly basis  its estimates of costs of the cleanup of various sites  including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party 
when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a minimum cost or a reasonable estimate of the cost of remediation can be determined  the applicable amount is accrued 
actual costs can differ from estimates due to changes in laws and regulations  discovery and analysis of site conditions and changes in technology 
the company makes certain estimates for income taxes  which may include various tax planning strategies  in determining taxable income  the timing of deductions and the utilization of tax attributes 
management is required to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations on the future abandonment cost of its oil and gas properties and equipment 
the company reviews its estimate of the future obligation periodically and accrued the estimated obligation monthly based on sfas no 
 prior to adoption of sfas no 
 as described in recent accounting developments below 
the implementation of this standard had an immaterial impact on the financial statements of the company 
recent accounting developments in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
all provisions of this statement will be effective at the beginning of fiscal however  as allowed  the company opted to implement this standard in see note to the financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and amends apb no 
 reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
this statement requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less costs to sell 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
this statement also retains apb no 
s requirement that companies report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations 
all provisions of this statement were effective in the first quarter of and its implementation had no material impact on the financial statements taken as a whole 
in the fourth quarter of  the company adopted the supplemental disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the company continues to record compensation related to employee stock options based on the intrinsic value method per apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
encourages companies to voluntarily elect to record the compensation based on market value either prospectively  as defined in sfas no 
 or retroactively or in a modified prospective method 
among other things  the company is concerned about the reasonableness of the values of its stock options determined using the black scholes method 
therefore  the company has delayed the potential transition to recording stock compensation based on fair market value until there is more clarity regarding the measurement of stock option values 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the company has not been significant in recent years because of the relatively low rates of inflation experienced in the united states 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has significant market risk exposure related to the prices received for the sale of its crude oil 
a change in oil price will equate to an approximate million change in annual revenues 
the company periodically enters into hedge contracts to manage the oil price risk 
in  the company entered into a number of hedges  based on wti pricing  on  barrels per day  or approximately of total production 
the hedges have a floor ranging from to  whereby the company will receive to below these prices 
they also have ceilings ranging from to  whereby the company will give up to above these prices 
additionally  the company utilizes more than one counterparty on these hedges and monitors each counterparty s credit rating 
the company is also at risk for a widening of the differential between the wti crude oil price and the posted price of the company s heavy crude oil 
to minimize this risk  the company has a sales contract in place through where more than of its crude oil production is priced at the higher of local field posting plus a bonus  or wti minus a fixed differential 
the company also has market risk exposure related to the price received for the sale of its electricity production and the cost paid by the company for the natural gas used in its cogeneration operations 
the company s three cogeneration facilities  when combined  have electricity production capacity of mw of electricity hour mwh 
of this total  the company sells approximately mwh and the remaining mwh is consumed in the company s operations 
the company s goal is to control its spark spread the difference between the sales price received for its electricity and the cost to purchase natural gas used as fuel in the cogeneration operations 
the company consumes approximately  mmbtu day of natural gas as fuel in these facilities 
a change of 
mmbtu in the cost of natural gas used in the cogeneration facilities equates to a change of approximately million in operating costs 
the company has a long term electricity sales contract in place through july  at a fixed price of mwh plus capacity on approximately mwh of electricity production with a major utility 
a change of mwh in the price received for electricity on the remaining mwh equates to approximately million in annual revenues 
during  the majority of the remaining electricity was sold on the open market to a creditworthy customer 
to protect a portion of the company s electrical production from low off peak power prices  the company entered into a series of fixed price swap agreements on mwh of off peak hour electricity 
at december   the company has swap agreements in place through may  at prices ranging from to per mwh 
in january  the company entered into three reformed or reinstated standard offer contracts with pg e and sce which should result in improved electrical pricing in these contracts will expire no later than december  the company is pursuing longer term arrangements on the sale of electricity and may enter into hedges on its natural gas purchases to seek to improve the spark spread in and beyond 
the company also consumes up to an additional  mmbtu day of additional natural gas as fuel in its conventional generators  which are used to supplement the company s steam requirements 
a change of 
in the cost of this natural gas requirement equates to a change of approximately 
million in operating costs 
the company may enter into hedges on natural gas purchases to help control this cost or shut in the conventional generators if deemed appropriate 
related to its natural gas purchases  the company is also exposed to the volatility in the differential between gas prices at the southern california border and henry hub delivery points 
to help minimize the risk  the company entered into a  mmbtu day firm transportation agreement on the kern river pipeline expansion with gas deliveries to commence in mid this agreement provides the company additional flexibility in securing its natural gas supply and allows the company to potentially benefit from discounted natural gas prices in the rockies 
this is a take or pay contract and the company is required to pay approximately 
mmbtu if the company does not take delivery of gas volumes under the agreement 
forward looking statements safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed in this form k are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
although the company believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include  but are not limited to  the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for oil  gas and electricity  a limited marketplace for electricity sales within california  counterparty risk  competition  environmental risks  litigation uncertainties  drilling  development and operating risks  the availability of drilling rigs and other support services  legislative and or judicial decisions and other government regulations
