item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and the other financial information included elsewhere in this form k report 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains descriptions of the company s expectations regarding future trends affecting its business 
these forward looking statements and other forward looking statements made elsewhere in this document are made in reliance upon safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the following discussion sets forth certain factors the company believes could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
overview we are a medical device company focused on bringing solutions to interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists 
our product line includes the duett tm sealing device  the d stat tm flowable hemostat and the acolysis r therapeutic ultrasound system 
as a vertically integrated medical device company  we generate ideas and create new interventional medical devices  and then deliver those products directly to the physician through our direct domestic sales force and international distribution network 
we commenced operations in february  and during and we received regulatory approvals to market our first product  the duett sealing device  in several international markets  principally in europe 
on june   we received approval from the fda of our pma application for the sale of our duett sealing device in the united states 
as a result  during the third quarter of we commenced sales of the duett in the united states through our direct sales force 
we commenced sales of the diagnostic duett in the united states in december  and commenced sales of the d stat in the united states in february in april  we acquired the assets of the acolysis system from the secured creditors of angiosonics  inc the acolysis controller and probes have been sold in international markets  principally in europe and china  for over two years 
during the last quarter of  we commenced active international sales of the acolysis product 
we have a limited history of operations and have experienced significant operating losses since inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
although we have experienced revenue growth in recent periods  this growth may not be sustainable and  therefore  these recent periods should not be considered indicative of future performance 
we may never achieve profitability  or if we achieve profitability it may not be sustained in future periods 
critical accounting policies the critical accounting policies of the company are described in note to the financial statements 
we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition  and require complex management judgment 
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we record reserves for inventory shrinkage and for potentially excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory based upon historical experience and forecasted demand 
our reserve requirements could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of competitive conditions or market acceptance  or if products become obsolete because of advancements in the industry 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to customers  net of estimated returns 
we analyze the rate of historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which is included with the allowance for doubtful accounts on our balance sheet 
if the historical data the company uses to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill in fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
we regularly review the carrying value of certain long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate an impairment or an adjustment to the amortization period is necessary 
if circumstances suggest the recorded amounts cannot be recovered  calculated based upon estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the carrying values of these assets are reduced to fair value 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased modestly to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  approximately of our net sales for the year ended december  were to customers in the united states and of the net sales were to customers in international markets 
net sales in were negatively affected by the intense competitive environment for our duett sealing device in the united states market 
net sales during benefited from the early sales of our d stat flowable hemostat  which we launched in february gross profit as a percentage of net sales was unchanged at for the year ended december  and we added the diagnostic duett  d stat and acolysis products to our selling mix during  which all have gross margins greater than 
the introduction of the higher margin products in was offset by a growth in the lower margin international sales 
we expect gross margins to slightly increase in as we again introduce new higher margin products in and make slight gains in manufacturing efficiencies 
research and development expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to more focused development work on the product line extensions and new products during research and development expenses can fluctuate due to outside project spending 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase modestly during as we continue to pursue additional new products 
clinical and regulatory expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  clinical and regulatory expenses fluctuate due to the timing of clinical and marketing studies 
we are expecting clinical expenses to increase in as we move forward with additional indications for our existing d stat flowable hemostat and international studies of our new products 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the reason for the decrease is better cost utilization 
we have reviewed our sales and marketing expenditures and focused our spending in the areas that drive sales and provide an adequate financial return 
as of december   our direct sales force consisted of approximately employees compared to approximately as of december  as a result  we expect our sales and marketing expenses to again slightly decrease during as we continue to review our sales and marketing expenditures 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was the result of lower headcount in compared to we currently anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease in as we continue to benefit from lower headcount and the settlement of all of our outstanding intellectual property litigation 
legal settlement expenses were  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  we entered into an agreement that settled all existing intellectual property litigation with datascope corporation in see legal proceedings in item of part i of this form k 
as part of the settlement  datascope released us from any claim of patent infringement based on past or future sales of the duett sealing device 
in exchange  we paid datascope a single lump sum of  in the fourth quarter of we entered into an agreement that settled all existing intellectual property litigation with st 
jude medical in see legal proceedings in item of part i of this form k 
as a result of the settlement  we agree to pay st 
jude medical a royalty of of our duett sales up to a maximum amount over the remaining life of the st 
jude medical patents 
we paid  to st 
jude medical in representing the past royalty on net sales of our duett device since under the settlement agreement 
amortization of purchased technology was  for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the amortization was the result of our acquisition of the acolysis assets from the secured creditors of angiosonics  inc we allocated  from the acquisition to purchased technology and are amortizing the amount over four years 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  primarily as a result of a reduced cash balance and lower interest rates 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in net sales was principally the result of a full year of united states sales of our duett sealing device in  compared to six months of sales in as a result  of our net sales for the year ended december  were to customers in the united states  while of the net sales were to our customers in international markets 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase as a percentage of net sales resulted principally from the full year of united states sales in in the third quarter of we settled our intellectual property litigation with st 
jude medical 
as part of the settlement agreement  we agreed to pay a royalty of of our net sales of the duett sealing device to st 
jude medical up to a maximum amount for the remaining life of the patents 
this royalty was included in our costs of goods sold beginning in the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of we commenced initial sales of our diagnostic duett version of the duett sealing device in the united states 
the diagnostic duett has a substantially lower costs of goods sold than the original duett  which is offset by a lower average selling price 
research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to increased development work on the product line extensions and new products during clinical and regulatory expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of additional personnel and the commencement of clinical studies for new products and new claims for our duett sealing device during sales and marketing expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the full year of operations of our united states direct sales force during general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase was legal fees associated with the st 
jude medical and datscope litigation increased during as compared with interest income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  primarily as a result of a full year of interest on the cash proceeds received upon the closing of our initial public offering in july income taxes we have not generated any pre tax income to date and therefore have not paid any federal income taxes since inception in december no provision or benefit for federal and state income taxes has been recorded for net operating losses incurred in any period since our inception 
as of december   we had  of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which begin to expire in the year as of december   we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which begin to expire in the year under the tax reform act of  the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances  including significant changes in ownership interests 
future use of our existing net operating loss carryforwards may be restricted due to changes in ownership or from future tax legislation 
we have established a valuation allowance against the entire amount of our deferred tax asset because we have not been able to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the deferred tax asset  due primarily to our history of operating losses 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed all of our operations since inception through the issuance of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of our products 
through december   we have sold common stock and preferred stock generating aggregate net proceeds of million 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities on hand 
during the year ended december   we used million in operating activities 
the cash used in operating activities was primarily used to fund our net loss for the period of million  which was offset by depreciation and amortization of  included in the net loss of million was the legal settlement of  to datascope see legal proceedings in item of part i of this form k 
we generated proceeds of  in investing activities  primarily from the net sales of investment securities of  offset by the  in cash used in the acquisition of angiosonics acolysis system and net equipment purchases of  we used  in financing activities during fiscal  primarily from the repurchase of our common stock for  offset by  we received through the issuance of common stock 
in april  we paid  in cash to the secured creditors of angiosonics  inc in connection with the acquisition of the acolysis system  related patents and technologies 
this acquisition was funded through existing cash balances 
in august  the board of directors adopted a stock repurchase program to acquire up to million shares of our common stock in open market transactions 
the program does not obligate the company to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time 
through december   we have repurchased  shares under our stock repurchase program for we do not have any significant cash commitments related to supply agreements  nor do we have any significant commitments for capital expenditures 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to experience a negative cash flow for the foreseeable future and our expenses will be a material use of our cash resources 
we anticipate that our operating losses will continue through at least mid we believe that current cash balances along with cash generated from the future sales of products will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
our liquidity and capital requirements beyond the next months will depend on numerous factors  including the extent to which our current and future products gain market acceptance and competitive developments 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our cash needs  we may be required to raise additional funds 
we currently have no commitments for additional funding and so our ability to meet our long term liquidity needs is uncertain 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our shareholders may experience significant dilution 
furthermore  additional financing may not be available when needed or  if available  financing may not be on terms favorable to us or our shareholders 
if financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or market our products or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed 
we will not be successful if the interventional medical device community does not adopt our products during the third quarter of we commenced sales of our first product  the duett sealing device  in the united states  which we believe represents the largest market for interventional medical devices 
we have not become profitable with the initial sales of our duett sealing device  and we are in the process of introducing additional interventional medical devices to grow our sales 
our success will depend on the medical community s acceptance of our products 
we cannot predict how quickly  if at all  the medical community will accept our new products  or  if accepted  the extent of their use 
our potential customers must o believe that our products offer benefits compared to the methodologies and or devices that they are currently using  o believe that our products are worth the price that they will be asked to pay  and o be willing to commit the time and resources required to change their current methodology 
if we encounter difficulties in growing our sales of our new medical devices in the united states  our business will be seriously harmed 
we currently rely on the duett sealing device as our primary source of revenue although we have sold the d stat flowable hemostat for approximately one year and we recently commenced marketing of the acoylsis system  we continue to rely on sales of our principal product  the duett sealing device  which is being sold in a limited number of international markets and in the united states 
even though we are in the process of developing additional products  preparation of regulatory approval  implementation timing and market uncertainties will exist with each new product 
as a result  our success to a large degree is dependent on the maintenance and growth of our duett sealing device business 
to date we have not been able to grow our share of the vascular sealing device market over with our duett sealing device 
if we are unable to maintain and modestly grow our duett sealing device market share  our business will be seriously harmed 
we have incurred losses and we may not be profitable in the future since we commenced operations in february  we have incurred net losses primarily from costs relating to the development and commercialization of our duett sealing device 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to significantly invest in our sales and marketing  and research and development activities 
because of our plans to introduce new products  hire additional employees and expand our commercialization  we expect to incur significant net losses through at least mid our business strategies may not be successful and we may not be profitable in any future period 
if we do become profitable  we cannot be certain that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we may face additional intellectual property claims in the future which could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or result in our incurring substantial costs and liabilities the interventional cardiology industry is characterized by numerous patent filings and frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation 
companies in the interventional cardiology industry in general  and in vascular sealing in particular  have employed intellectual property litigation in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage 
we are aware of many united states patents issued to other companies in the vascular sealing field which describe vascular sealing devices 
each of the currently marketed vascular sealing products has been subject to infringement litigation 
although we have settled all of our previous intellectual property litigation with respect to our duett sealing device  it is possible that additional claims relating to the duett could be brought in the future 
in addition  it is possible that we could be subject to intellectual property claims with respect to any of our new products 
intellectual property litigation in recent years has proven to be very complex  and the outcome of such litigation is difficult to predict 
an adverse determination in any intellectual property litigation or interference proceedings could prohibit us from selling our products  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
the costs associated with these license arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  the necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our product 
our defense of intellectual property claims filed in the future  regardless of the merits of the complaint  could divert the attention of our technical and management personnel away from the development and marketing of our products for significant periods of time 
the costs incurred to future claims could be substantial and seriously harm us  even if our defense is ultimately successful 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  which may adversely affect the price of our common stock the limited history of our sales and our history of losses make prediction of future operating results difficult 
you should not rely on our past revenue growth as any indication of future growth rates or operating results 
the price of our common stock will likely fall in the event that our operating results do not meet the expectations of analysts and investors 
comparisons of our quarterly operating results are an unreliable indication of our future performance because they are likely to vary significantly based on many factors  including o the level of sales of our duett sealing device and new products in the united states market  o our ability to introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner  o the demand for and acceptance of our products  o the success of our competition and the introduction of alternative products  o our ability to command favorable pricing for our products  o the growth of the market for our devices  o the expansion and rate of success of our direct sales force in the united states and our independent distributors internationally  o actions relating to ongoing fda compliance  o the effect of intellectual property disputes  o the size and timing of orders from independent distributors or customers  o the attraction and retention of key personnel  particularly in sales and marketing  regulatory  manufacturing and research and development  o unanticipated delays or an inability to control costs  o general economic conditions as well as those specific to our customers and markets  and o seasonal fluctuations in revenue due to the elective nature of some procedures 
our direct sales efforts may not be successful because we have a limited operating history with a direct sales force because we received regulatory approval to sell our duett sealing device in the united states during  we have only a limited operating history with a direct sales force 
we believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel and clinical specialists with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we require 
we may not be able to obtain  train and retain sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel and the future sales efforts of our direct sales force may not be successful 
we may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities the manufacture and sale of medical products entail significant risk of product liability claims 
the medical device industry in general has been subject to significant medical malpractice litigation 
any product liability claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  reduced sales  cause us to incur significant liabilities and divert our management s time  attention and resources 
because of our limited operating history and lack of experience with these claims  we cannot be sure that our product liability insurance coverage is adequate or that it will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
the market for vascular sealing devices is highly competitive and will likely become more competitive  and our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our duett sealing device obsolete the existing market for vascular sealing devices is intensely competitive 
we expect competition to increase further as additional companies begin to enter this market and or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours 
our primary competitors are abbott laboratories through its subsidiary perclose  inc  datascope corp 
and st 
jude medical  inc  which sells a product developed by kensey nash corporation 
these companies have o better name recognition  o broader product lines  o greater sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  o significantly greater financial resources  o larger research and development staffs and facilities  and o existing relationships with some of our potential customers 
we may not be able to effectively compete with these companies 
in addition  broad product lines may allow our competitors to negotiate exclusive  long term supply contracts and offer comprehensive pricing for their products 
broader product lines may also provide our competitors with a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralized purchasing 
greater financial resources and product development capabilities may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our duett sealing device obsolete 
our international sales are subject to a number of risks that could seriously harm our ability to successfully commercialize our products in any international market our international sales are subject to several risks  including o the ability of our independent distributors to sell our device  o the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  o greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs or other trade barriers  o weaker intellectual property rights protection in some countries  o potentially adverse tax consequences  and o political and economic instability 
the occurrence of any of these events could seriously harm our future international sales and our ability to successfully commercialize our products in any international market 
we have limited manufacturing experience and may encounter difficulties in our manufacturing operations which could seriously harm our business we have limited experience in manufacturing our products 
we are currently in the process of moving our facilities to a new location 
we believe our new facilities will be adequate for our projected production of our products for the foreseeable future  but future facility requirements will depend largely on future sales of our products in the united states 
we may encounter unforeseen difficulties in moving our production in the near future  expanding our production of our new products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel  compliance with fda regulations and requirements regarding good manufacturing practices  and the need for further regulatory approval of new manufacturing processes 
difficulties encountered by us in expanding our manufacturing capabilities could seriously harm our business 
our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed by changes in third party reimbursement policies we could be seriously harmed by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private healthcare payors  particularly to the extent any changes affect reimbursement for catheterization procedures in which our duett sealing device or d stat hemostat is used 
failure by physicians  hospitals and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement from healthcare payors for procedures in which our products are used or adverse changes in governmental and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for such procedures would seriously harm our business 
in the united states  healthcare providers  including hospitals and clinics that purchase medical devices such as our duett sealing device or d stat hemostat  generally rely on third party payors  principally federal medicare  state medicaid and private health insurance plans  to reimburse all or part of the cost of catheterization procedures 
we believe that in a prospective payment system  such as the system currently used by medicare  and in many managed care systems used by private healthcare payors  the cost of our product will be incorporated into the overall cost of the procedure and that there will be no separate  additional reimbursement for our product 
in international markets  acceptance of our products is dependent in part upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
however  we are unaware of any hospitals that receive specific  cost based  direct reimbursement for the use of our duett sealing device or our d stat hemostat 
reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country 
our failure to receive international reimbursement approvals could have a negative impact on market acceptance of our products in the markets in which these approvals are sought 
our products and our manufacturing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation that could prevent us from selling our products in the united states or introducing new and improved products our products and our manufacturing activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental agencies  including the fda and comparable international agencies 
we are required to o obtain the approval of the fda and international agencies before we can market and sell our products  o satisfy these agencies content requirements for all of our labeling  sales and promotional materials  and o undergo rigorous inspections by these agencies 
compliance with the regulations of these agencies may delay or prevent us from introducing any new model of our existing products or other new products 
furthermore  we may be subject to sanctions  including temporary or permanent suspension of operations  product recalls and marketing restrictions if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to our business 
we are also required to demonstrate compliance with the fda s quality system regulations 
the fda enforces its quality system regulations through pre approval and periodic post approval inspections 
these regulations relate to product testing  vendor qualification  design control and quality assurance  as well as the maintenance of records and documentation 
if we are unable to conform to these regulations  the fda may take actions which could seriously harm our business 
in addition  government regulation may be established that could prevent  delay  modify or rescind regulatory clearance or approval of our products 
the loss of  or interruption of supply from  key vendors  including single source suppliers  could limit our ability to manufacture our products we purchase components used in our duett sealing device and d stat flowable hemostat from various suppliers and rely on single sources for the collagen and thrombin components of our duett sealing device procoagulant and our d stat flowable hemostat 
there are currently no fda approved alternative suppliers of thrombin and very few fda approved alternative suppliers of collagen 
our current supply agreement with our thrombin vendor extends through  but there are no assurances that any future agreement would be on similar terms 
because it requires fda approval  establishing additional or replacement suppliers for thrombin would require a lead time of at least two years and would involve significant additional costs 
any supply interruption from key vendors or failure by us to engage alternative vendors may limit our ability to manufacture our duett sealing device and our d stat flowable hemostat and could therefore seriously harm our business
