net income for increased by million due to the adoption of two accounting policies  financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fasb  and a change in the method of deferring policy acquisition costs 
fasb increased net income by million per basic share and per diluted share and the change in deferred policy acquisition costs increased net income by million per basic share and per diluted share 
regulatory and rating agencies use the statutory premiums to surplus ratio as a measure of solvency  viewing an increase in the ratio as a possible increase in solvency risk 
management and analysts also view this ratio as a measure of the effective use of capital since  as the ratio increases  revenue per dollar of invested capital increases  indicating the possible opportunity for an increased return 
changes in both the gaap and statutory combined ratios are viewed by management and analysts as indicative of changes in the profitability of underwriting operations 
a ratio over is indicative of an underwriting loss  and a ratio below is indicative of an underwriting profit

from continuing operations  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements and this section for further discussion 
was a year characterized by serious challenges for the entire property and casualty insurance industry and the us economy 
however  our competitive positioning and growth strategies enabled us to reach the goals we set for and reinforce our capacity for continued improvement 
we surpassed our record revenue of billion and net premiums written of million with revenue from continuing operations of billion and net premiums written over the billion dollar threshold to billion 
these results increased net income to million  or per diluted share on  weighted average shares  compared with million or per diluted share in on  weighted average shares and million or per diluted share in on  weighted average shares 
the increase for compared with was attributable to our core commercial lines operation  where we achieved our th straight quarter of double digit price increases 
these increases averaged for  compared with in and in net investment income earned for the year was million compared with million in and million in the company generated operating cash flows of million in  compared with million in and million in the operating cash flows coupled with the million net proceeds from the senior convertible notes  increased our overall investment portfolio to billion 
this higher asset base drove our increased investment income  even though interest rates continue to trend downward 
the decrease in compared with was due to i lower interest rates  ii lower return on our investments in limited partnerships that are subject to market fluctuations see note j to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion  and iii lower year end distributions from mutual funds 
net pre tax realized gains for decreased to million from million in and million in realized investment gains and losses fluctuate based on investment decisions regarding individual securities as well as tax planning strategies 
for the year  we reported operating income from continuing operations of million  compared with million in and million in operating income from continuing operations differs from net income by the exclusion of after tax realized gains or losses on investment sales  as well as net income from discontinued operations 
it is used as an important financial measure by management  analysts and investors  but is not intended as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
this financial measure may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies 
we manage our business in three segments insurance operations commercial lines underwriting and personal lines underwriting  investments  and diversified insurance services 
the summaries below provide further insight into these segments 
insurance operations for  net premiums written were billion  an increase of  over net premiums written of million which were higher than net premiums written of million 
the increase included approximately million in new business  up over last year s million  while included million 
net premiums written for commercial lines grew in  while personal lines were up 
this growth reflects our ongoing strategy to primarily focus on our core commercial lines operation  while building a smaller  but profitable personal lines segment 
for  our overall statutory combined ratio was down from in and in this ratio was better than the am best estimated industry wide statutory combined ratio of for historically in the insurance industry  the ratio of statutory premiums to surplus has been used as a measure of solvency 
an increase in the ratio can indicate a possible increase in solvency risk 
management and certain analysts also view this ratio as a measure of the effective use of capital since  as the ratio increases  revenue per dollar of invested capital increases  indicating the possible opportunity for an increased return 
our statutory premiums to surplus ratio has increased to x in from x in  but this increase is mainly due to the effect of price increases and not to increased exposure 
commercial lines results commercial lines net premiums written were million for  or approximately of our total net premiums written  million for and million for growth in our core commercial lines operation was led by a increase in renewal price increases for the year  compared with for and for commercial lines policies in force were  at december  compared with  in and  in even with these price increases  retention at point of renewal was for  versus in included in the net premiums written totals are new business of million in  compared with million in and million in we believe that the increase in new business was primarily attributable to our field strategy  which puts underwriting and claims specialists in direct contact with our agencies 
this new business growth also reflects continued agency integration of our small business and technology initiatives through systems such as one done  our internet based business system that allows agents to issue small business policies from their offices 
in  our agents processed million of new small commercial business through one done  compared with million in  the initial year this system was in use 
policies entered through one done accounted for more than of our new commercial policies in the company s commercial lines combined ratio finished the year at  compared with in and in price increases  combined with underwriting improvements  are driving these profitability improvements 
our commercial lines statutory combined ratios showed similar improvements  as finished at compared with in and in our commercial lines loss and loss expense ratio was in  compared with in and in the decrease in the ratio in from was attributable to the renewal price increase which had an effect of points on the loss and loss expense ratio 
this was offset by points of loss trends  point of catastrophes losses and points of reinsurance costs 
the decrease in the ratio in from was attributable to the renewal price increase which had an effect of points on the loss and loss expense ratio and points of favorable catastrophe losses 
this was offset by points of loss trends and point of reinsurance costs 
we yielded solid improvements in underwriting results across most commercial lines segments 
the statutory combined ratio for commercial property dropped to  compared with in and in the commercial automobile statutory combined ratio improved to  for the year  compared with in and in  while the business owners policy statutory combined ratio improved to  compared with in and in improvements in these lines reflect higher pricing  as well as continued underwriting improvement and heightened loss control efforts  all of which lead to a better overall mix of business 
our workers compensation line requires further improvement  however  as the statutory combined ratio increased to  compared with in and in we saw an increase in claim severity during  primarily from contracting and manufacturing risks 
these risks accounted for of our losses greater than  in response to this  we are writing less business in certain contracting classes  along with eliminating new business policies written for one to three person operations 
to increase earned premium we have reduced our average schedule credit  to an average of in compared with in and in since these credits reduce net premiums written  by reducing the credits we are increasing our net premiums written 
where obtainable  we are also seeking aggressive pricing  which includes an average increase effective january  in new jersey  one of our larger workers compensation markets 
it is also important to keep in mind our use of account based underwriting 
in new jersey  for example  our workers compensation statutory combined ratio was for compared with in and in however  the state s overall commercial lines statutory combined ratio came in at for compared with in and in  demonstrating our ability to manage the workers compensation product as just one component of the overall commercial account 
we experienced higher than expected loss emergence in for past accident years in our other liability line of business 
this led to a statutory combined ratio of in  compared with in and in the liability line of business is inherently volatile  which makes it more difficult to reserve 
to bring our statutory combined ratio back to levels seen in prior years we have tightened underwriting guidelines 
as a result  we are restricting the amount of work a contractor is able to subcontract  requiring written contracts with hold harmless and indemnification agreements in place and setting minimum limits of liability coverage 
in addition  we have revised underwriting guidelines in our restaurant business  to allow less liquor sales  disallow playground or recreational activities  and require more stringent life safety measures in each restaurant 
the commercial lines underwriting expense ratio decreased to in down from in and in these improvements reflect the higher prices as well as the high tech  high touch approach that makes it easy and cost effective for our agents to do business with us 
one done is part of our small business strategy to eliminate redundancies in the independent agency distribution model by delivering easy and efficient systems 
this system allows us to write business at a marginal underwriting expense ratio of about 
this will have a positive impact on our underwriting expense ratio as we use one done to process more business 
we have begun to roll out our web based commercial lines system that delivers real time rating to our agencies  while enabling them to seamlessly exchange information with the company 
having our agents perform tasks that in the past would have been performed by a selective employee has allowed us to reduce staff  which has also contributed to the reduced underwriting expense ratio 
overall  selective agencies utilized these systems to enter more than of commercial policies directly from their offices 
in addition  two years ago we established our underwriting service center 
the underwriting service center services smaller accounts for a reduction in commission  so agents can focus their attention on larger  more complex accounts 
the underwriting service center was servicing more than million of premiums as of the end of agents are beginning to realize that it is not efficient to handle small business  and that our underwriting service center is a better option 
personal lines results personal lines net premiums written were million in  million in  and million in the increase in net premiums written is attributable to renewal price increases reaching an average of in  compared with in and a decrease of in due to the rate roll back imposed by new jersey s automobile insurance cost reduction act aicra 
the personal lines combined ratio for the year was  compared with last year and in this decrease was caused primarily by a decrease in the new jersey personal automobile loss and loss expense ratio for the year to from in and in this decrease reflects an million pre tax reserve charge taken during due to the shortfall in estimated savings for the company s new jersey private passenger automobile liability coverage from aicra 
the charge added points to the overall and points to the new jersey personal automobile combined ratio for the personal lines ratio of losses and loss expenses incurred decreased points  to in  compared with  in and in due to two years of favorable pricing and tier changes and the reserve charge taken during this book of business  however  remains unprofitable 
as we continue to earn higher premiums from price and tier changes  we expect ongoing improvements in our new jersey personal automobile results 
in  we continued to see reductions in new business submissions for new jersey personal automobile  with our market share now down to approximately compared with in and in new jersey insured vehicles declined to  over the course of from approximately  in new jersey personal automobile net premiums written now represents about of our overall net premiums written down from in and in in addition  we were recently granted a increase  effective in march that will continue the upward trend of higher premiums per vehicle 
our average premium per vehicle in new jersey increased for  compared with an increase of in  while it remained flat in during  we also realized commission savings of million over  as we reduced our commission schedule to be more in line with competitors 
in our nine other personal lines states  net premiums written were up for the year to million  compared with million in and million in  reflecting the ongoing implementation of price increases  tier changes and other underwriting actions to improve results 
we also continue efforts to control our exposure in new york due to the high cost of required participation in the involuntary automobile insurance market 
in  we decreased the number of vehicles written in new york by more than  to under  compared with  in and  in our personal lines statutory combined ratio for these nine states was  compared with in and in  reflecting the negative impact of charges relating to the new york assigned risk automobile business 
excluding new york  the full year ratio was  compared with in and in  and in line with our full year revised estimate of 
obviously  these results are not acceptable  and we have extensive plans  by state  to establish an appropriate level of profitability 
price and tier changes for these nine states  totaling more than for automobile and about for homeowners over the last two years  continue to favorably impact net premiums earned 
we are aggressively pursuing additional double digit rate increases and tier changes in  as personal lines prices continue to push upward industry wide 
reinsurance renewals we recently completed the renewals for our calendar reinsurance treaties 
all three treaties remained substantially unchanged from our new jersey homeowners quota share treaty renewed at the expiring million per occurrence limit with form following coverage 
premiums ceded under this treaty remained flat compared with the prior year at approximately million 
terms and conditions remained relatively the same 
our property catastrophe treaty renewed at existing limits of million and retention of million 
terrorism coverage is excluded as per definition of the terrorism risk insurance act tria as well as nuclear  biological and chemical losses 
the overall program cost for this treaty was million  an increase of over last year s million 
the million retention would be reduced to a minimum retention of million for a new jersey region catastrophe  due to a provision under the treaty that provides selective up to million of benefit from the new jersey homeowners quota share treaty 
our bond treaty included a slight increase in retention  to  in from  in and a small co participation feature  but the rate remained stable at of subject premium 
on november  tria legislation was signed into law 
the program terminates on december  tria requires sharing the risk of future losses from terrorism between private insurers and the federal government  and is applicable to almost all commercial lines of insurance 
insurance companies with direct commercial insurance exposure in the united sates are required to participate in the program 
with the signing of this legislation  all previously approved exclusions for terrorism are rescinded 
over the three months december to february  we notified existing commercial policyholders of the existence of the federal backstop  offered comparable terrorism coverage and specified the cost of that coverage in accordance with the requirements of tria 
policyholders have the option to accept or decline the coverage  or negotiate other terms 
these provisions apply to new policies written after enactment 
an event has to cause million in losses to be certified as an act of terrorism 
each participating insurance company will be responsible for paying out a certain amount in claims a deductible before federal assistance becomes available 
this deductible is based on a percentage of direct earned premiums from calendar year the deductible is as follows percent from enactment through the end of the year  percent  percent  and percent 
for losses above a company s deductible  the federal government will cover  while the company contributes 
while the provisions of tria will serve to mitigate our exposure in the event of a large scale terrorist attack  our deductible is substantial  approximating million in therefore  we continue to monitor concentrations of risk 
effective february   selective has purchased a separate treaty that covers million in the aggregate in excess of a million retention in the aggregate for tria  as well as  nuclear  biological and chemical losses not covered by the act 
our property and casualty excess of loss treaties were renewed effective july  under our casualty treaty  the company retains the first million of any casualty loss as well as of the next million in losses in excess of the million retention 
for contract year  the company retained of this layer 
the casualty program provides coverage of million in excess of the company s million retention in six layers  except commercial umbrella  which is reinsured up to million 
the casualty contract includes one annual aggregate limit by coverage layer for a terrorism loss 
nuclear  biological and chemical losses are excluded  but there is no exclusion for mold losses or cyber risks 
the underlying selective policies exclude nuclear losses  however  biological and chemical losses are covered to some extent on most policies 
the property excess of loss structure remained unchanged with coverage of up to million per risk in excess of the company s retention of million 
this treaty includes terrorism coverage for all risks that are under million in total insured value  with annual aggregate limits of million for the first layer  million for the second layer and million for the third layer 
nuclear  biological and chemical losses are excluded  but there is no exclusion for mold losses or cyber risks 
the underlying policies exclude nuclear losses  however  biological and chemical losses are covered to some extent on most policies 
the estimated reinsurance cost for the property and casualty excess of loss treaties is projected to be approximately million for the contract year ending june  compared with million for contract year ending june and million for contract year ending june reinsurance costs over the past three years have trended upward reflecting poor industry wide reinsurance results  including the september th terrorist attacks  as well as concerns about industry wide asbestos and other environmental claims 
our costs reflect these factors despite our relatively good results and significantly lower exposure to these industry wide issues 
investments although lower interest rates have put pressure on investment returns  we still generated an increase in before tax investment income to million for the year  compared with million for and million in the increase reflects an increased asset base as our overall investment portfolio reached billion 
this was due to strong operating cash flows of million in  compared with million in and in coupled with the net proceeds of million from the senior convertible notes offered in september 
our before tax portfolio yield was in consistent with but lower than the in we continue to maintain a conservative  diversified investment portfolio  with our debt security holdings representing of invested assets 
of our debt securities portfolio is rated aaa while the portfolio has an average rating of aa  standard poor s second highest credit quality rating 
high credit quality continues to be a cornerstone of our investment strategy  as evidenced by the fact that of the debt securities are investment grade 
the following table presents the moody s and standard poor s ratings of our debt securities portfolio rating aaa aaa aa aa a a baa bbb other total we emphasize liquidity requirements in response to an unpredictable underwriting environment and the need to minimize the exposure to catastrophic events 
to provide liquidity while maintaining consistent performance  debt security maturities are laddered so that some issues are always approaching maturity  thereby providing a source of predictable cash flow 
to reduce sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations  we invest our debt securities portfolio primarily in intermediate term securities 
the average maturity of the portfolio at december  was years compared with years at december  we will continue to follow our investment philosophy that has historically proven successful 
the strategy is to continue to purchase debt securities in sectors that represent the most attractive relative value and maintain a moderate equity exposure 
managing investment risk by adhering to these strategies is intended to protect the interests of our stockholders as well as those of our policyholders and  at the same time  enhance our financial strength and underwriting capacity 
the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio for declines in value  focusing attention on securities whose market value is less than of their cost amortized cost at the time of review 
if we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary  we record the decline as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income 
if we believe the decline is other than temporary  we write down the carrying value of the investment and record a realized loss in our consolidated statements of income 
our assessment of a decline in value includes our current judgment as to the financial position and future prospects of the entity that issued the investment security 
broad changes in the overall market or interest rate environment  generally will not lead to a write down 
if our judgment about an individual security changes in the future we may ultimately record a realized loss after having originally concluded that the decline in value was temporary  which could have a material impact on our net income and financial position of future periods 
factors considered  but not limited to  in evaluating potential impairment of debt securities include the following whether the decline appears to be issuer or industry specific  the degree to which an issuer is current or in arrears in making principal and interest payments on the debt securities in question  the issuer s current financial condition and its ability to make future scheduled principal and interest payments on a timely basis  buy hold sell recommendations published by outside investment advisors and analysts  and relevant rating history  analysis and guidance provided by rating agencies and analysts 
factors considered  but not limited to  in evaluating potential impairment of equity securities include the following whether the decline appears to be issuer or industry specific  the relationship of market prices per share to book value per share at the date of acquisition and date of evaluation  the price earnings ratio at the time of acquisition and date of evaluation  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including any specific events that may influence the issuer s operations  the recent income or loss of the issuer  the independent auditors report on the issuer s recent financial statements  the dividend policy of the issuer at the date of acquisition and the date of evaluation  any buy hold sell recommendations or price projections published by outside investment advisors  and any rating agency announcements 
realized gains and losses are determined on the basis of the cost of specific investments sold or written down  and are credited or charged to income 
realized losses include impairment charges from investment write downs for other than temporary declines of million for  million for and million for these securities were written down due to heightened credit risk that was security specific and would not impact other securities held

diversified insurance services the diversified insurance services businesses create a fee based source of revenue that is not dependent on insurance underwriting cycles 
these businesses are not capital intensive and strengthen our ability to develop new revenue streams in fast growing markets 
during  our diversified insurance services strategy further evolved  which led to a more refined focus on businesses that provide synergy with our agency force and create new opportunities for agents to bring added value services and products to their customers 
this focus has led us to consolidate our diversified insurance services operations into three core functions human resource administration outsourcing hr outsourcing  managed care and flood insurance 
the businesses fit into our business model in one of two ways complementary they share a common marketing or distribution system or vertically one company uses the other s products or services in its own product or supply output 
the flood and hr outsourcing products are sold through our independent agent distribution channel  while our managed care businesses provide an integral service used by our claims operation  as well as by other insurance carriers 
we measure the performance of these companies in terms of revenue growth  results of operations  and returns on revenue 
the continuing operations of diversified insurance services generated million of revenue and million of net income for  compared with million of revenue and million of net loss for and million of revenue and million of net income for the segment s return on net revenue increased to for  compared with for and for our hr outsourcing company  selective hr solutions  inc  provides human resource administration  including benefits  payroll and employee management services  and risk and compliance management products and services  including workers compensation insurance 
hr outsourcing  by the nature of its product package  provides a very high level of day to day services to its customers  which we believe will be attractive to small business owners  who can be accessed through existing relationships with our independent agents 
hr outsourcing revenues increased to million for  compared with million for and million for net loss decreased to million  compared with million for and net income of million for due to market pricing pressures  revenue increases have not kept pace with increasing product costs and as a result we continue to implement new pricing and cost reduction initiatives 
during  labor related expenses were down about over as a direct result of such initiatives 
in revenue increases were more than offset by a million workers compensation reserve increase combined with increased variable and infrastructure costs thus resulting in a net loss compared with our managed care companies 
alta services llc alta  selectech  llc selectech  consumer health network plus  llc chn and northeast health direct  llc nhd 
provide workers compensation and automobile medical claim services  third party administrative services and discounted access to the number one membership based medical provider network in new jersey while bearing no underwriting risks 
network expansion has been  and will continue to be a major initiative for our managed care program 
during our medical provider network expanded to just over  locations from  locations in this expansion was primarily the result of the acquisition of nhd  a  location network that operates in connecticut and certain regions within the states of massachusetts  vermont  and new hampshire 
chn acquired nhd for million including certain acquisition and financial performance related costs during chn may be further required to pay additional consideration of approximately million over the next two years based on certain criteria related to future financial performance 
managed care revenues increased to million for  compared with million for and million for net income decreased to million in  compared with million for and million for the increase in revenue during was attributable to network growth and expansion  but was more than offset by increased legal expenses and benefit costs 
in an effort to reduce operating expenses  initiatives are currently underway to consolidate offices and reduce staff counts as duplicate functions are eliminated 
increases in both revenues and net income during were the result of network and client expansion 
selective is a servicing carrier for the national flood insurance program 
through this program  selective is able to provide a market for flood insurance to over  agents across the country 
as a servicing carrier  selective bears no risk of policyholder loss since the program is fully reinsured by the federal government 
currently  selective is servicing more than  flood policies under this program  compared with  in and  in this growth resulted in an increase in servicing fees in of to million  compared with million for and million for this increase in servicing revenues resulted in a corresponding increase in net income to million for  compared with million for and million for in december the company s management adopted a plan to divest itself of its ownership interest in pda software services  inc pda  which had historically been reported as part of the diversified insurance services segment 
this divestiture plan was realized in may when the company sold all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of pda as well as certain software applications developed by pda at a net gain of million 
in addition  the company recovered million of capitalized software development costs 
federal income taxes our total federal income tax expense increased million in to an expense of million  compared with a benefit of million in and million in these amounts reflect an effective tax rate of for  compared with in and in the expense in reflects improved underwriting results as well as an increase in net investment income  which was comprised of a higher percentage of taxable securities as compared with prior years 
the benefit in and reflects lower taxable income for those years due mainly to increased underwriting losses 
our effective tax rate differs from the federal corporate rate of primarily as a result of tax exempt investment income and the dividends received deduction 
the total deferred tax asset declined slightly at december  to million  compared with million at december  increases in current year deferred policy acquisition costs and unrealized gains on the available for sale investment portfolio were offset by increases in loss reserve discounting  unearned premium reserves and additional alternative minimum tax credits generated by regular tax net operating loss carrybacks for and the following table presents the company s taxable income loss  pre tax financial statement income and net deferred tax asset in millions current taxable income loss  from continuing operations pretax financial statement income net deferred tax asset critical accounting policies we have identified the policies described below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
note that our preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
reserves for losses and loss expenses significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the insurer s payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and loss expenses  insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported net losses and loss expenses 
as of december   the company had accrued billion of loss and loss expense reserves compared with billion at december  when a claim is reported to an insurance subsidiary  its claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the type of losses 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices  as well as the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
until the claim is resolved  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by the responsible claims personnel based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the cases 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain  in addition to case reserves  estimates of reserves for losses and loss expenses incurred but not yet reported ibnr 
we project our estimate of ultimate losses and loss expenses at each reporting date 
the difference between i projected ultimate loss and loss expense reserves and ii case loss reserves and loss expense reserves thereon is carried as the ibnr reserve 
by using both estimates of reported claims and ibnr determined using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques  we estimate the ultimate net liability for losses and loss expenses 
we have established a range of reasonably possible ibnr losses for non environmental net claims of approximately million to million at december  and of approximately million to million at december  a low and high reasonable ibnr selection was derived primarily by considering the range of indications calculated using standard actuarial techniques 
such techniques assume that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  are an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
our net carried ibnr reserves for non environmental claims  including loss expense reserves  were million at december  and million at december  the ultimate actual liability may be higher or lower than reserves established 
we do not discount to present value that portion of our loss and loss expense reserves expected to be paid in future periods 
however  the loss reserves include anticipated recoveries from salvage and subrogation 
reserves are reviewed by both internal and independent actuaries for adequacy on a periodic basis 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of various factors such as i per claim information  ii company and industry historical loss experience  iii legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and iv trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method  however  for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by many factors 
included in the reserves above are amounts for environmental claims  both asbestos and non asbestos 
these claims have arisen primarily under older policies containing exclusions for environmental liability which certain courts  in interpreting such exclusions  have determined do not bar such claims 
the emergence of these claims is slow and highly unpredictable 
since  policies issued by the insurance subsidiaries have contained a more expansive exclusion for losses related to environmental claims 
our asbestos and non asbestos environmental claims have arisen primarily from exposures in municipal government  small commercial risks and homeowners policies 
ibnr reserve estimation for environmental claims is often difficult because  in addition to other factors  there are significant uncertainties associated with critical assumptions in the estimation process such as average clean up costs  third party costs  potentially responsible party shares  allocation of damages  insurer litigation costs  insurer coverage defenses and potential changes to state and federal statutes 
however  management is not aware of any emerging trends that could result in future reserve adjustments 
moreover  normal historically based actuarial approaches are difficult to apply because relevant history is not available 
in addition  while models can be applied  such models can produce significantly different results with small changes in assumptions 
as a result  management does not calculate a specific environmental loss range  as it believes it would not be meaningful 
the table below summarizes the number of asbestos and non asbestos claims outstanding at december   and for additional information about our environmental reserves  see page and note a to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental claims activity asbestos related claims claims at beginning of year    claims received during year claims closed during year claims at end of year    average net loss settlement on closed claims  amount paid to administer claims non asbestos related claims claims at beginning of year claims received during year claims closed during year claims at end of year average net loss settlement on closed claims    amount paid to administer claims the number of environmental claims presented in the tables includes all multiple claimants who are associated with the same site or incident 
includes claims dismissed  settled  or otherwise resolved 
of the  asbestos related claims   involve only three insureds 
the case reserves associated with these three insureds amounted to million on a net and gross basis 
about of the total environmental claims involve approximately landfill sites 
the landfill sites account for case reserves of million on a gross basis and million on a net basis 
the remaining claims  which account for million of case reserves on a gross basis and million on a net basis  involve leaking underground storage tanks and other latent environmental exposures 
after taking into account all relevant factors  we believe that the reserve for net losses and loss expenses at december   is adequate to provide for the ultimate net costs of claims incurred as of that date 
establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
premium revenue net premiums written equal direct premiums written  plus assumed premiums less ceded premiums 
all three components of net premiums written are recognized in revenue over the period that coverage is provided 
the vast majority of our net premiums written have a coverage period of twelve months 
this means we record of the net premiums written as earned premium each month  until the full amount is recognized 
it should be noted that when premium rates increase  the effect of those increases will not immediately affect earned premium 
rather  those increases will be recognized ratably over the period of coverage 
unearned premiums and prepaid reinsurance premiums  which are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets  represent that portion of premiums written that are applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force 
deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs  which include commissions  premium taxes  fees  and certain other costs of underwriting policies  are deferred and amortized over the same period in which the related premiums are earned 
deferred policy acquisition costs are limited to the estimated amounts recoverable after providing for losses and loss expenses that are expected to be incurred  based upon historical and current experience 
anticipated investment income is considered in determining whether a premium deficiency exists 
the methods of making such estimates and establishing the deferred costs are continually reviewed by the company  and any adjustments therefrom are made in the accounting period in which the adjustment arose 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources selective insurance group  inc parent is an insurance holding company whose principal assets are its investments in its insurance and diversified insurance services subsidiaries 
the parent s primary means of meeting its liquidity requirements is through dividends from these subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends from the insurance subsidiaries is governed by state regulatory requirements  and these dividends are generally payable only from earned surplus as reported in our statutory annual statements as of the preceding december see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
dividends from diversified insurance services subsidiaries are restricted only by the operating needs of those subsidiaries 
the parent s cash requirements include principal and interest payments on the senior convertible notes  various notes payable and convertible subordinated debentures  dividends to stockholders and general operating expenses 
the parent generates cash from the sale of its common stock under various stock plans  the dividend reinvestment program  and from investment income  all of which approximated million and reduced the parent s annual cash requirements from million to million 
as indicated in the table on the next page  the company has contractual obligations pursuant to convertible subordinated debentures and various notes payable of million in as part of our senior convertible note issuance  the company has established an irrevocable trust in the amount of million  to provide funds for the notes payable maturities scheduled in the next three years 
based upon the unaudited statutory financial statements  the insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay the parent in ordinary dividends in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
there can be no assurance that the insurance subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends to the parent in the future in an amount sufficient to enable the parent to meet its liquidity requirements 
for additional information regarding regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiaries to the parent and amounts available for the payment of such dividends  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
growth in the diversified insurance services segment has augmented consolidated cash flows from operations by generating million in  compared with million in and million in dividends to stockholders are declared and paid at the discretion of the board based upon the company s operating results  financial condition  capital requirements  contractual restrictions and other relevant factors 
the parent has paid regular quarterly cash dividends to its stockholders for consecutive years and currently plans to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends 
for information regarding restrictions on the parent s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders  see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the cash requirements of the parent  our operating obligations and cash outflow include claim settlements  commissions  labor costs  premium taxes  general and administrative expenses  investment purchases  and capital expenditures 
the insurance subsidiaries satisfy their obligations and cash outflow through premium collections  interest and dividend income and maturities of investments 
on may   the board of directors extended the expiration date of the stock repurchase program to may  there are approximately  shares remaining under the current repurchase authorization of million shares 
the company also has additional investment commitments for its limited partnership investments of up to million  however there is no certainty that any additional investment will be required 
financial instruments that could potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk include accounts receivable associated with our hr outsourcing subsidiary  which acts as a co employer with certain clients 
as a co employer  we contractually assume substantial employer rights  responsibilities and risks of its clients employees  who are considered co employees 
co employer payroll and related service fees that were earned  but unpaid  were million as of december  and million as of december  certain states in which we conduct this business  limit a co employer s liability for earned payroll to minimum wage 
this would reduce the company s potential liability for accrued co employer payroll 
in the event that a client does not pay their related payroll and service fees prior to the applicable payroll date  the company has the right to cancel the co employer contract or at its option  require letters of credit or other collateral 
as of december  the maximum exposure to any one account for earned payroll is approximately million 
hr outsourcing is also subject to geographic concentration 
approximately of co employer client payroll is within the state of florida 
other east coast states  including georgia  maryland  new jersey  virginia  north carolina  south carolina  pennsylvania  new york  and delaware account for substantially all of our other business 
consequently  changes to economic or regulatory conditions in these states could adversely affect the hr outsourcing operations 
cash provided by operating activities amounted to million in  million in  and million in this increase in is a result of i a increase in net premiums written and improved underwriting profitability  driven by rate increases in renewal premiums  ii increased investment income from a larger investment portfolio  and iii approximately million more operating cash generated by our diversified insurance services companies due to revenue growth and a million increase in their net income 
since cash inflow from premiums is received in advance of cash outflow required to settle claims  we accumulate funds that we invest 
at december  we had billion in investments compared with billion in as a result of increased operating cash flow combined with the net proceeds from the issuance of senior convertible notes 
our investment program is structured with staggered maturities so that liquidation of available for sale debt securities should not be necessary in the ordinary course of business 
total assets increased  or million  from december  to december  this increase was primarily due to i an increase in total investments of million resulting from the million operating cash flow  million net proceeds from our senior convertible notes and an increase of million in pre tax unrealized gains in the available for sale investment portfolio  as well as additional purchases of available for sale debt securities from cash received from increased net premiums written  ii a increase in premium receivables of million and a increase in deferred policy acquisition costs of million  both corresponding with the net premiums written growth for the year 
the rise in total liabilities of million  or  from december  to december   was attributable to i the senior convertible notes offering of million  ii an increase in unearned premium reserve of  or million  due to growth in net premiums written over the year  and our loss and loss expense reserves of  or million  due to normal reserve development and growth in net premiums written over the year we are subject to financial strength ratings produced by external rating agencies 
the principal agencies that cover the property and casualty industry are am best company am best  standard poor s rating services s p  moody s investor service moody s and fitch ratings service fitch 
we believe our ability to write business is most influenced by our rating from am best 
we are currently rated a superior by am best  which is their second highest of fifteen ratings 
a rating below a from am best  could materially adversely affect the business we write 
we believe that ratings from s p  moody s or fitch  although important  have less of an impact on our business 
the company continually reviews its financial agreements for any potential rating triggers that could dictate a significant change in terms of the agreements if the company s credit rating were to suddenly and drastically change 
a rating downgrade to below a in its am best or s p rating would be considered an event of default under the terms of the company s line of credit agreements 
the company had no outstanding borrowings on these lines at december  or holders of the senior convertible notes due may surrender their note for conversion during any period in which the credit rating assigned to the notes is ba or lower by moody s or bb or lower by s p 
while these triggers would not materially affect our results of operations or financial condition  they may impact certain financial ratios 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments at december  and  the company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  the company is not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships 
our future cash payments associated with contractual obligations pursuant to operating leases for office space and equipment  senior convertible notes  convertible subordinated debentures and notes payable as of december  are summarized below contractual obligations less than after in millions total year years years years operating leases senior convertible notes convertible subordinated debentures notes payable total we fully expect to have the capacity to repay and or refinance these obligations as they come due 
we currently have available revolving lines of credit amounting to million  under which no balances are outstanding as of either december  or see note d to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
we have issued no guarantees on behalf of others and have no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
we have no material transactions with related parties other than those disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
audit committee approval of non audit services in accordance with section a i of the securities exchange act of  as amended  as added by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to disclose non audit services approved by our audit committee to be performed by kpmg  llp  our independent auditors 
non audit services are services other than those provided in connection with an audit or a review of our financial statements and the financial statements of our subsidiaries 
during  kpmg  llp did not provide any non audit services to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of potential loss in fair value arising from adverse fluctuations in interest rates  market rates and prices  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
the following is a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposures and how they were being managed as of december  our market risk sensitive instruments are for other than trading purposes 
our investment policy is conservative with the long term objective of maximizing after tax yield while providing liquidity and preserving assets and stockholders equity 
the current investment mix is debt securities  equity securities  short term investments and other investments 
we have no direct exposure to commodity risk and minimal exposure to foreign exchange risk 
to reduce the sensitivity of interest rate fluctuations  we invest our debt securities portfolio primarily in intermediate term securities 
at december   of the portfolio was ten years or less to maturity  with the average maturity of years 
our portfolio of marketable equity securities is exposed to equity price risk arising from potential volatility in equity market prices 
we attempt to minimize the exposure to equity price risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio limiting concentrations in any one company or industry 
for our overall investment portfolio  there were no significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed compared with the year ended december  we do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
we utilize sensitivity analysis to measure the potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments 
the sensitivity analysis hypothetically assumes i a parallel basis point shift in interest rates up and down in basis point increments  and ii a change in equity prices up and down in increments at december  and in the analysis  we include investments in debt securities and investments in equity securities 
the primary market risk to the company s market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk and equity price risk 
this analysis is not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates and equity prices on our income or stockholders equity 
further  the calculations do not take into account any actions we may take in response to market fluctuations 
the following table presents the sensitivity analysis of each component of market risk as of december  and interest rate shift in basis points in millions market value of debt security portfolio      market value change from base interest rate shift in basis points market value of debt security portfolio      market value change from base change in equity values in percent market value of equity portfolio change in equity values in percent market value of equity portfolio
