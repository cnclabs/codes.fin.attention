panhandle energy owns and operates compressor stations and has five underground gas storage fields located in illinois  michigan  kansas  oklahoma and louisiana with a combined maximum working storage capacity of approximately billion cubic feet 
panhandle energy also has contracts with third parties that provide for approximately billion cubic feet of storage 
panhandle energy owns an lng regasification plant and related lng tanker port  unloading facilities and lng storage facilities located at lake charles  louisiana 
this lng plant is one of the largest operating lng facilities in north america  based on its current sustainable sendout capacity of approximately million cubic feet per day 
panhandle energy has plans to expand its sendout capacity to approximately billion cubic feet per day 
a majority of panhandle energy s revenue comes from long term service agreements with local distribution company customers 
panhandle energy also provides firm transportation services under contract to gas marketers  producers  other pipelines  electric power generators  and a variety of end users 
in addition  panhandle energy offers both firm and interruptible transportation to customers on a short term or seasonal basis 
demand for gas transmission on panhandle energy s pipeline systems is seasonal  with the highest throughput and a higher portion of annual operating revenues and net earnings occurring in the traditional winter heating season 
in fiscal  panhandle energy s operating revenues and throughput were million and tbtu billion british thermal unit  respectively 
of this operating revenue  percent was generated from transportation services  percent from lng terminalling services  percent from storage services and percent from other services 
aggregate sales to panhandle energy s top ten customers accounted for percent of the segment s operating revenue in fiscal panhandle energy has no single customer  or group of customers under common control  which accounted for ten percent or more of the company s consolidated revenues in fiscal for additional information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business segment results 
regulation panhandle energy is subject to regulation by various federal  state and local governmental agencies  including those specifically described below 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has comprehensive jurisdiction over panhandle eastern pipe line  southwest gas storage  trunkline  trunkline lng and sea robin as natural gas companies within the meaning of the natural gas act 
ferc jurisdiction relates  among other things  to the acquisition  operation and disposal of assets and facilities and to the service provided and rates charged 
ferc has authority to regulate rates and charges for transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce  as well as those for gas  sold by a natural gas company in interstate commerce for resale 
ferc also has authority over the construction and operation of pipeline and related facilities utilized in the transportation and sale of natural gas in interstate commerce  including the extension  enlargement or abandonment of service using such facilities 
panhandle eastern pipe line  trunkline  sea robin  trunkline lng  and southwest gas storage hold certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the ferc  authorizing them to construct and operate the pipelines  facilities and properties now in operation for which such certificates are required  and to transport and store natural gas in interstate commerce 
the secretary of energy regulates the importation and exportation of natural gas and has delegated various aspects of this jurisdiction to ferc and the department of energy s office of fossil fuels 
panhandle energy is also subject to the natural gas pipeline safety act of and the pipeline safety improvement act of  which regulate the safety of gas pipelines 
panhandle energy is also subject to the hazardous liquid pipeline safety act of  which regulates oil and petroleum pipelines 
competition panhandle energy s interstate pipelines compete with other interstate and intrastate pipeline companies in the transportation and storage of natural gas 
the principal elements of competition among pipelines are rates  terms of service and flexibility  and reliability of service 
panhandle energy primarily competes with alliance pipeline lp  anr pipeline company  natural gas pipeline company of america  northern border pipeline company  texas gas transmission corporation  northern natural gas company and vector pipeline in the midwest market area 
natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to panhandle energy s customers and end users  including electricity  coal and fuel oils 
the primary competitive factor is price 
changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy  the level of business activity  conservation  legislation and governmental regulations  the capability to convert to alternate fuels  and other factors  including weather and natural gas storage levels  affect the demand for natural gas in the areas served by panhandle energy 
distribution segment services the distribution segment is primarily engaged in the local distribution of natural gas in missouri  pennsylvania  rhode island and massachusetts 
its operations are conducted through the company s three regulated utility divisions missouri gas energy  pg energy and new england gas company 
collectively  the utility divisions serve more than  residential  commercial and industrial customers through local distribution systems consisting of  miles of mains   miles of service lines and miles of transmission lines 
each utility division s rates and operations are subject to regulation by the regulatory commission of any states in which it operates 
the utility divisions operations are generally sensitive to weather and seasonal in nature  with a significant percentage of annual operating revenues and net earnings occurring in the traditional winter heating season 
in fiscal  this segment represented percent of the company s total operating revenues because the transportation and storage segment s assets were acquired on june  in fiscal  and  the distribution segment s operating revenues were  million  million and  million  respectively  average customers served totaled   and  respectively  and gas volumes sold or transported totaled  million cubic feet mmcf   mmcf and  mmcf  respectively 
the distribution segment has no single customer  or group of customers under common control  which accounted for ten percent or more of the company s consolidated revenues in fiscal for additional information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business segment results 
a description of each of the company s regulated utility divisions follows 
missouri gas energy missouri gas energy mge  headquartered in kansas city  missouri  serves approximately  customers in central and western missouri including kansas city  st 
joseph  joplin and monett through a local distribution system that consists of approximately  miles of mains   miles of service lines and miles of transmission lines

the and year measure is used for consistent external reporting purposes 
measures of normal weather used by the company s regulatory authorities to set rates vary by jurisdiction 
periods used to measure normal weather for regulatory purposes range from years to years 
pg energy pg energy  headquartered in wilkes barre  pennsylvania  serves approximately  customers in northeastern and central pennsylvania including wilkes barre  scranton and williamsport through a local distribution system that consists of approximately  miles of mains   miles of service lines and miles of transmission lines

gas supply the cost and reliability of natural gas service is dependent upon the company s ability to contract for favorable mixes of long term and short term gas supply arrangements and through favorable fixed and variable transportation contracts 
the company has been directly acquiring its gas supplies since the mid s when interstate pipeline systems opened their systems for transportation service 
the company has the organization  personnel and equipment necessary to dispatch and monitor gas volumes on a daily  hourly and even a real time basis to ensure reliable service to customers 
the ferc required the unbundling of services offered by interstate pipeline companies beginning in as a result  gas purchasing and transportation decisions and associated risks have been shifted from the pipeline companies to the gas distributors 
the increased demands on distributors to effectively manage their gas supply in an environment of volatile gas prices provides an advantage to distribution companies such as southern union who have demonstrated a history of contracting favorable and efficient gas supply arrangements in an open market system 
the majority of gas requirements for the utility operations of missouri gas energy and pg energy were delivered under short and long term transportation contracts through four major pipeline companies 
the majority of gas requirements for the utility operations of new england gas company were delivered under long term transportation contracts through four major pipeline companies 
these contracts have various expiration dates ranging from calendar year through missouri gas energy and new england gas company have firm supply commitments for all areas that are supplied with gas purchased under short and long term arrangements 
pg energy has firm supply commitments for all areas that are supplied with gas purchased under short term arrangements 
missouri gas energy  pg energy and new england gas company hold contract rights to over bcf  bcf and bcf of storage capacity  respectively  to assist in meeting peak demands 
storage capacity in approximated of the utility operations annual gas distribution volumes 
gas sales and or transportation contracts with interruption provisions  whereby large volume users purchase gas with the understanding that they may be forced to shut down or switch to alternate sources of energy at times when the gas is needed for higher priority customers  have been utilized for load management by southern union and the gas industry as a whole 
in addition  during times of special supply problems  curtailments of deliveries to customers with firm contracts may be made in accordance with guidelines established by appropriate federal and state regulatory agencies 
there have been no supply related curtailments of deliveries to missouri gas energy  pg energy  or new england gas company utility sales customers during the last ten years 
competition as energy providers  missouri gas energy  pg energy  and new england gas company have historically competed with alternative energy sources  particularly electricity  propane  fuel oil  coal  natural gas liquids and other refined products available in their service areas 
at present rates  the cost of electricity to residential and commercial customers in the company s regulated utility service areas generally is higher than the effective cost of natural gas service 
there can be no assurance  however  that future fluctuations in gas and electric costs will not reduce the cost advantage of natural gas service 
competition between the use of fuel oils  natural gas and propane  particularly by industrial and electric generation customers  has also increased due to the volatility of natural gas prices and increased marketing efforts from various energy companies 
in order to be more competitive with certain alternate fuels in pennsylvania  pg energy offers an alternate fuel rate for eligible customers 
this rate applies to commercial and industrial accounts that have the capability of using fuel oils or propane as alternate sources of energy 
whenever the cost of such alternate fuel drops below pg energy s normal tariff rates  pg energy is permitted by the ppuc to lower its price to these customers so that pg energy can remain competitive with the alternate fuel 
however  in no instance may pg energy sell gas under this special arrangement for less than its average commodity cost of gas purchased during the month 
competition between the use of fuel oils  natural gas and propane  is generally greater in pennsylvania and new england than in the company s missouri service area  however  this competition affects the nationwide market for natural gas 
additionally  the general economic conditions in the company s regulated utility service areas continue to affect certain customers and market areas  thus impacting the results of the company s operations 
the company s regulated utility operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and small commercial customers within their service areas 
in  the commonwealth of pennsylvania enacted the natural gas choice and competition act  which extended the ability to choose suppliers to small commercial and residential customers as well 
effective april   all of pg energy s customers have the ability to select an alternate supplier of natural gas  which pg energy will continue to deliver through its distribution system under regulated transportation service rates with pg energy serving as supplier of last resort 
customers can also choose to remain with pg energy as their supplier under regulated natural gas sales rates 
in either case  the applicable rate results in the same operating margin to pg energy 
despite customers acquired right to choose  higher than normal wholesale prices for natural gas have prevented suppliers from offering competitive rates 
regulation and rates the utility operations are regulated as to rates and other matters by the regulatory commissions of the states in which each operates 
in missouri and pennsylvania  natural gas rates are established by the mpsc and ppuc  respectively  on a system wide basis 
in rhode island  the ripuc approves natural gas rates for new england gas company 
in massachusetts natural gas rates for new england gas company are subject to the regulatory authority of the mdte 
the company holds non exclusive franchises with varying expiration dates in all incorporated communities where it is necessary to carry on its business as it is now being conducted 
providence  rhode island  fall river  massachusetts  kansas city  missouri  st 
joseph  missouri  are the four largest cities in which the company s utility customers are located 
the franchise in kansas city  missouri expires in the company fully expects this franchise to be renewed upon its expiration 
the franchises in providence  rhode island  fall river  massachusetts  and st 
joseph  missouri are perpetual 
gas service rates are established by regulatory authorities to permit utilities the opportunity to recover operating  administrative and financing costs  and the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on equity 
gas costs are billed to customers through purchase gas adjustment pga clauses  which permit the company to adjust its sales price as the cost of purchased gas changes 
this is important because the cost of natural gas accounts for a significant portion of the company s total expenses 
the appropriate regulatory authority must receive notice of such adjustments prior to billing implementation 
other than in pennsylvania  the company supports any service rate changes to its regulators using an historic test year of operating results adjusted to normal conditions and for any known and measurable revenue or expense changes 
because the regulatory process has certain inherent time delays  rate orders may not reflect the operating costs at the time new rates are put into effect 
in pennsylvania  a future test year is utilized for ratemaking purposes  therefore  rate orders more closely reflect the operating costs at the time new rates are put into effect 
the monthly customer bill contains a fixed service charge  a usage charge for service to deliver gas  and a charge for the amount of natural gas used 
while the monthly fixed charge provides an even revenue stream  the usage charge increases the company s annual revenue and earnings in the traditional heating load months when usage of natural gas increases 
weather normalization clauses serve to stabilize earnings 
new england gas company has a weather normalization clause in the tariff covering its rhode island operations 
missouri on july   the mpsc issued an order approving a unanimous settlement of missouri gas energy s rate request 
the settlement provides for an annual  base rate increase  as well as  in added revenue from new and revised service charges 
the majority of the rate increase is recovered through increased monthly fixed charges to gas sales service customers 
new rates became effective august   two months before the statutory deadline for resolving the case 
the approved settlement resulted in the dismissal of all pending judicial reviews of prior rate cases 
the settlement also provided for the development of a two year experimental low income program to help certain customers in the joplin area pay their natural gas bills 
the mpsc approval of the january  acquisition of missouri gas energy by the company was subject to the terms of a stipulation and settlement agreement  which  among other things  required missouri gas energy to reduce rate base by  amortized over a ten year period on a straight line basis to compensate rate payers for rate base reductions that were eliminated as a result of the acquisition 
rhode island on may   the ripuc approved a settlement offer filed by new england gas company related to the final calculation of earnings sharing for the month period covered by the energize rhode island extension settlement agreement 
this calculation generated excess revenues of  the net result of the excess revenues and the energize rhode island weather mitigation and non firm margin sharing provisions is the crediting to customers of  over a twelve month period starting july  on may   the ripuc approved a settlement agreement between the new england gas company and the rhode island division of public utilities and carriers 
the settlement agreement resulted in a  decrease in base revenues for new england gas company s rhode island operations  a unified rate structure one state  one rate and an integration merger savings mechanism 
the settlement agreement also allows new england gas company to retain  of merger savings and to share incremental earnings with customers when the division s rhode island operations return on equity exceeds 
included in the settlement agreement was a conversion to therm billing and the approval of a reconciling distribution adjustment clause dac 
the dac allows new england gas company to continue its low income assistance and weatherization programs  to recover environmental response costs over a year period  puts into place a new weather normalization clause and allows for the sharing of nonfirm margins non firm margin is margin earned from interruptible customers with the ability to switch to alternative fuels 
the weather normalization clause is designed to mitigate the impact of weather volatility on customer billings  which will assist customers in paying bills and stabilize the revenue stream 
new england gas company will defer the margin impact of weather that is greater than colder than normal and will recover the margin impact of weather that is greater than warmer than normal 
the non firm margin incentive mechanism allows new england gas company to retain of all non firm margins earned in excess of  pennsylvania in december  the ppuc approved a settlement agreement that provided for a rate increase designed to produce  of additional annual revenue 
the new rates became effective on january  in addition to the regulation of its utility businesses  the company is affected by other regulations  including pipeline safety requirements of the united states department of transportation  safety regulations under the occupational safety and health act  and various state and federal environmental statutes and regulations 
the company believes that its utility operations are in material compliance with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations 
environmental the company is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these evolving laws and regulations may require expenditures over a long period of time to control environmental impacts 
the company has established procedures for the on going evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures 
the company is investigating the possibility that the company or predecessor companies may have been associated with manufactured gas plant mgp sites in its former gas distribution service territories  principally in texas  arizona and new mexico  and present gas distribution service territories in missouri  pennsylvania  massachusetts and rhode island 
at the present time  the company is aware of certain mgp sites in these areas and is investigating those and certain other locations 
while the company s evaluation of these texas  missouri  arizona  new mexico  pennsylvania  massachusetts and rhode island mgp sites is in its preliminary stages  it is likely that some compliance costs may be identified and become subject to reasonable quantification 
within the company s distribution service territories certain mgp sites are currently the subject of governmental actions 
the company s interstate natural gas transportation operations are subject to federal  state and local regulations regarding water quality  hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters 
the company has identified environmental contamination at certain sites on its gas transmission systems and has undertaken cleanup programs at these sites 
the contamination resulted from the past use of lubricants containing polychlorinated bi phenyls pcbs in compressed air systems  the past use of paints containing pcbs  and the prior use of wastewater collection facilities and other on site disposal areas 
the company has developed and is implementing a program to remediate such contamination in accordance with federal  state and local regulations 
some remediation is being performed by former company affiliates in accordance with indemnity agreements that also indemnify against certain future environmental litigation and claims 
the company is also subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to air quality control 
these regulations include rules relating to regional ozone control and hazardous air pollutants 
the regional ozone control rules are known as state implementation plans sip and are designed to control the release of nitrogen oxide nox compounds 
the rules related to hazardous air pollutants are known as maximum achievable control technology mact rules and are the result of the clean air act amendments that regulate the emission of hazardous air pollutants from internal combustion engines and turbines

the seasonal nature of southern union s business results in a high level of cash flow needs to finance gas purchases and other energy costs  outstanding customer accounts receivable  and certain tax payments 
additionally  significant cash flow needs may be required to finance current debt service obligations 
to provide these funds  as well as funds for its continuing construction and maintenance programs  the company has historically used cash flows from operations and its credit facilities 
because of available credit and the ability to obtain various types of market financing  combined with anticipated cash flows from operations  management believes it has adequate financial flexibility and access to the financial markets to meet its short term cash needs

on september   the company acquired valley resources and on september   the company acquired both fall river gas and provenergy 
see note ii acquisitions and sales 
acquisitions require a substantial increase in expenditures that may need to be financed through cash flow from operations or future debt and equity offerings 
the availability and terms of any such financing sources will depend upon various factors and conditions such as the company s combined cash flow and earnings  the company s resulting capital structure  and conditions in the financial markets at the time of such offerings 
acquisitions and financings also affect the company s combined results due to factors such as the company s ability to realize any anticipated benefits from the acquisitions  successful integration of new and different operations and businesses  and effects of different regional economic and weather conditions 
future acquisitions or related acquisition financing or refinancing may involve the issuance of shares of the company s common stock  which could have a dilutive effect on the then current stockholders of the company

critical accounting policies 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience  current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
nevertheless  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies  which are defined as those policies whereby judgments or uncertainties could affect the application of those policies and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note i summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements 
effects of regulation the company is subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities 
the company  in its distribution segment  has accounting policies which conform to the fasb standard  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and which are in accordance with the accounting requirements and ratemaking practices of the regulatory authorities 
the application of these accounting policies allows the company to defer expenses and revenues on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the ratemaking process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the income statement by an unregulated company 
these deferred assets and liabilities are then flowed through the results of operations in the period in which the same amounts are included in rates and recovered from or refunded to customers 
management s assessment of the probability of recovery or pass through of regulatory assets and liabilities requires judgment and interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders 
if  for any reason  the company ceases to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of its operations  the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria would be eliminated from the consolidated balance sheet and included in the consolidated statement of operations for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
the aggregate amount of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets are million and million at june   and million and million at june   respectively 
long lived assets long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangibles and equity investments  comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates about the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation methods and useful lives 
the company also reviews these assets for impairment on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of an asset s fair value with its carrying value  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in an amount equal to that excess 
management s determination of an asset s fair value requires it to make long term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the asset  when the asset s fair value is not readily apparent from other sources 
these forecasts require assumptions about future demand  future market conditions and regulatory developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
during june  the company evaluated goodwill for impairment 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows attributable to the company s reporting units that have goodwill  as compared to the carrying value of those reporting units net assets 
as of june   pursuant to the fasb standard  goodwill and other intangible assets  no impairment had been indicated 
in connection with the company s cash flow improvement plan announced in july  the company began the divestiture of certain non core assets 
as a result of prices of comparable businesses for various non core properties and pursuant to the fasb standard  impairment of long lived assets and assets to be disposed of  a goodwill impairment loss of  was recognized in depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended september  investments in securities the company holds securities of capstone turbine corporation capstone  which are classified as available for sale under the fasb standard accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
accordingly  these securities are stated at fair value  based on quoted market price  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in a separate component of common stockholders equity 
the remaining shares of capstone held at june  were sold subsequent to year end 
all other securities owned by the company are accounted for under the cost method 
these securities consist of common and preferred stock in non public companies whose value is not readily determinable 
a judgmental aspect of accounting for these securities involves determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has been sustained 
management reviews these securities on a quarterly basis to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary 
factors that are considered in assessing whether a decline in value is other than temporary include  but are not limited to earnings trends and asset quality  near term prospects and financial condition of the issuer  financial condition and prospects of the issuer s region and industry  and southern union s intent and ability to retain the investment 
if management determines that a decline in value is other than temporary  a charge will be recorded on the consolidated statement of operations to reduce the carrying value of the investment security to its estimated fair value 
in june  southern union determined that the decline in value of its investment in pointserve was other than temporary 
accordingly  the company recorded a non cash charge of  to reduce the carrying value of this investment to its estimated fair value 
the company recognized this valuation adjustment to reflect significant lower private equity valuation metrics and changes in the business outlook of pointserve 
pointserve is a closely held  privately owned company and  as such  has no published market value 
the company s remaining investment of  at june  may be subject to future market value risk 
the company will continue to monitor the value of its investment and periodically assess the impact  if any  on reported earnings in future periods 
pensions and other postretirement benefits the company accounts for pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs in accordance with the fasb standards employers accounting for pensions and employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively 
these statements require liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet at the present value of these future obligations to employees net of any plan assets 
the calculation of these liabilities and associated expenses require the expertise of actuaries and are subject to many assumptions including life expectancies  present value discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase and anticipated health care costs 
any change in these assumptions can significantly change the liability and associated expenses recognized in any given year 
however  the company expects to recover substantially all of its net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit costs attributable to employees in its distribution segment in accordance with the applicable regulatory commission authorization 
for financial reporting purposes  the difference between the amounts of pension cost and post retirement benefit cost recoverable in rates and the amounts of such costs as determined under applicable accounting principles is recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability  as appropriate 
derivatives and hedging activities the company utilizes derivative instruments on a limited basis to manage certain business risks 
interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks are used to reduce interest rate risks and to manage interest expense 
commodity swaps have been utilized to manage price risk associated with certain energy contracts 
the company accounts for its derivatives in accordance with the fasb standard  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
under this statement  all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
on the date the derivative contract is entered into  management designates the derivative as either i a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment a fair value hedge  ii a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid in connection with a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge  or iii an instrument that is held for trading or non hedging purposes a trading or non hedging instrument 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a fair value hedge  along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in earnings 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge  to the extent that the hedge is effective  are recorded in other comprehensive income  until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction eg  until periodic settlements of a variable rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings 
hedge ineffectiveness is recorded through earnings immediately 
lastly  changes in the fair value of derivative trading and non hedging instruments are reported in current period earnings 
fair value is determined based upon mathematical models using current and historical data 
the company formally assesses  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods 
the company discontinues hedge accounting when i it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item  ii the derivative expires or is sold  terminated  or exercised  iii it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur  or iv management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate 
in all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding  the company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet  recognizing changes in the fair value in current period earnings 
see note xi derivative instruments and hedging activities in notes to consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental and other matters 
accounting for contingencies requires significant judgments by management regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to potential liability 
for further discussion of the company s commitments and contingencies  see note xviii commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchase accounting the company s acquisition of panhandle energy has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the fasb standard  business combinations 
under this statement  the purchase price paid by the company  including transaction costs  was allocated to panhandle energy s net assets as of the acquisition date based on preliminary estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
accordingly  the panhandle energy assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of june  at their estimated fair value and are subject to further assessment and adjustment pending the results of outside appraisals 
determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the accounting rules provide a one year period following the consummation of an acquisition to finalize the fair value estimates 
accounting pronouncements effective july   the company adopted the fasb standard  accounting for asset retirement obligations aro 
the statement requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time the obligations are incurred 
upon initial recognition of a liability  costs should be capitalized as part of the related long lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related long lived asset 
in certain rate jurisdictions  the company is permitted to include annual charges for cost of removal in its regulated cost of service rates charged to customers 
the adoption of the statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows for all periods presented 
as a result of the acquisition of panhandle energy  the company assumed an aro liability of approximately million as of june   relating to the retirement of certain of panhandle energy s offshore lateral lines 
during fiscal  changes in the carrying amount of the aro liability attributable to i liabilities incurred  ii liabilities settled  iii accretion expense  and iv cash flow revisions were immaterial for the period the associated assets were owned by the company 
in addition  the company has reclassified approximately million of negative salvage previously included in accumulated depreciation to deferred credits for amounts collected for asset retirement obligations on certain of the panhandle energy assets acquired which are not recordable as liabilities under the statement but represent other obligations 
also effective july   the company adopted the fasb standard  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement provides new guidance on the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of and also broadens the definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented 
under the statement  assets held for sale that are a component of an entity will be included in discontinued operations if the operations and cash flows will be or have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations prospectively 
the adoption of this statement did not materially change the methods the company uses to measure impairment losses on long lived assets  but did result in the company s sale of its texas operations being reported as discontinued operations 
see note xix discontinued operations and assets held for sale in notes to consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others
