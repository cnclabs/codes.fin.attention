coach experiences significant seasonal variations in its working capital requirements

management believes that cash flow from operations and availability under the revolving credit facilities will provide adequate funds for the foreseeable working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and the common stock repurchase program 
any future acquisitions  joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital  and there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to coach on acceptable terms or at all 
coach s ability to fund its working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments  and to comply with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements  depends on its future operating performance and cash flow  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond coach s control

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value  earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates 
coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and  when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments with respect to coach japan 
the following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments  taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models 
these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual results may differ from those estimates

these countries include china  costa rica  italy  india  indonesia  malaysia  spain  turkey  thailand  taiwan  korea  hungary  singapore  great britain and the dominican republic 
additionally  sales are made through international channels to third party distributors 
substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties  excluding coach japan are denominated in us dollars and  therefore  are not hedged by coach using any derivative instruments 
coach is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its us dollar denominated inventory purchases 
the company  through coach japan  enters into certain foreign currency derivative contracts  primarily foreign exchange forward contracts  to manage these risks
