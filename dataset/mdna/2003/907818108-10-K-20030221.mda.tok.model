item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements  item  and other information included in this form k 
as stated in item  union pacific corporation upc or the corporation consists of two reportable segments  rail and trucking  as well as upc s other product lines other 
the rail segment includes the operations of union pacific railroad and its subsidiaries and rail affiliates uprr or the railroad 
the trucking segment includes overnite transportation company otc and motor cargo industries  inc motor cargo as of november   both operating as separate and distinct subsidiaries of overnite corporation overnite  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of upc 
the corporation s other product lines are comprised of the corporate holding company which largely supports the railroad  self insurance activities  technology companies and all appropriate consolidating entries see note to the consolidated financial statements  item critical accounting policies the corporation s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities 
the corporation bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following are the corporation s critical accounting policies that affect significant areas of the corporation s operations and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact on the consolidated financial statements may be material 
depreciation provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property 
the cost net of salvage of depreciable rail property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation 
various methods are used to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property 
due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets  variances to those estimates could have a material effect on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
environmental the corporation generates and transports hazardous and non hazardous waste in its current and former operations  and is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
the corporation has identified approximately sites at which it is or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements 
this includes sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government  of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list 
certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites  consequently  the corporation s ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties  in addition to costs relating to its own activities at each site 
when an environmental issue has been identified with respect to the property owned  leased or otherwise used in the conduct of the corporation s business  the corporation and its consultants perform environmental assessments on such property 
the corporation expenses the cost of the assessments as incurred 
the corporation accrues the cost of remediation where its obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated 
the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites  as well as for ongoing monitoring costs  but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties 
cost estimates are based on information available for each site  financial viability of other potentially responsible parties  and existing technology  laws and regulations 
the corporation believes that it has adequately accrued for its ultimate share of costs at sites subject to joint and several liability 
however  the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved  site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties  the degree of contamination by various wastes  the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites  and or the speculative nature of remediation costs 
income taxes the corporation accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on the corporation s financial position or its results of operations 
pension and postretirement benefits the corporation incurs certain employment related expenses associated with pensions and postretirement health benefits 
in order to measure the expense associated with these benefits  management must make various estimates and assumptions  including discount rates used to value liabilities  assumed rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates and expected future healthcare costs 
the estimates used by management are based on the corporation s historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances 
the corporation uses third party actuaries to assist management in properly measuring the expense and liability associated with these benefits 
actual future results that vary from the previously mentioned assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
recent declines in the equity markets have caused the market value of the plan assets to decrease 
as a result  a minimum pension liability adjustment of million  net of tax  was recorded in the fourth quarter of as a reduction to shareholders equity see note to the consolidated financial statements  item 
also  during  the corporation decreased its assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets from to 
this assumption change resulted in a million increase to pension expense 
while the interest rate and asset return environment have significantly impacted the funded status of the corporation s plans  the corporation does not have any minimum pension funding requirements  as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws 
personal injury and occupational illness the cost of injuries to employees and others related to railroad activities or in accidents involving the trucking segment is charged to expense based on actuarial estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year 
compensation for railroad work related accidents is governed by the federal employers liability act fela 
under fela  damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements 
the railroad offers a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 
changes in estimates can vary due to evolving trends in litigation related to personal injury and occupational illness cases based on large jury awards and public pressures associated with certain occupational related injuries 
compared to results of operations consolidated net income the corporation reported net income of billion per basic share and per diluted share in compared to million per basic share and per diluted share in the increase in net income resulted from double digit operating income growth  lower interest costs  two large asset sale transactions one with the utah transit authority uta for million pre tax and one with the santa clara valley transportation authority vta for million pre tax and tax adjustments of million for prior years income tax examinations 
operating income improved as revenue growth  lower fuel prices and productivity gains offset the effects of wage and benefit inflation and higher volume related costs 
productivity is measured by both gross ton miles per inflation adjusted expense dollar and gross ton miles per employee 
operating revenues operating revenues increased million to a record billion in  reflecting growth at the railroad and growth in the trucking segment including the impact of the motor cargo acquisition 
excluding motor cargo  revenue growth was in the trucking segment 
the corporation recognizes transportation revenues on a percentage of completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination 
other revenue is recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations are met 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million to billion in from billion in excluding motor cargo in and  operating expenses increased million 
the increase in expenses reflects wage and benefit inflation  higher equipment rents and depreciation expenses and increased purchased services and other costs 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in employment levels at the railroad  lower fuel prices and cost control efforts 
lower fuel prices for the railroad of cents per gallon in versus cents per gallon in  reduced fuel expense by million in salaries  wages and employee benefits increased million compared to excluding motor cargo  expenses increased million compared to as wage and benefit inflation and volume costs exceeded savings from lower employment levels and improved productivity 
equipment and other rents expense increased million as a result of a increase in carloads  additional locomotive lease expense and higher contract maintenance costs recognized at overnite 
depreciation expense increased million as a result of the railroad s capital spending in recent years which has increased the total value of the corporation s assets subject to depreciation 
fuel and utilities costs were down million compared to due to lower fuel prices and a lower fuel consumption rate  partially offset by higher gross ton miles at the railroad 
materials and supplies expense decreased million primarily due to reduced locomotive repairs partly offset by increased freight car repairs 
casualty costs increased million over due to higher personal injury and increased insurance costs 
purchased services and other costs increased million primarily due to an increase in outsourcing of locomotive contract maintenance services  as well as an increase in jointly owned facility expenses and state and local taxes 
operating income operating income increased million to a record billion in  as revenue growth  productivity gains and lower fuel prices more than offset inflation  increased depreciation expense and higher rail costs due to increased rail volume 
non operating items interest expense decreased million compared to due to lower weighted average debt levels and weighted average interest rates in in  the corporation s weighted average debt level including the convertible preferred securities decreased from  million in to  million in the corporation s weighted average interest rate was in as compared to in other income increased million in compared to due primarily to the asset sale transactions with the uta and vta 
income tax expense increased million in over as a result of higher pre tax income levels in which was partially offset by tax adjustments for prior years 
key measures net income as a percentage of operating revenues increased to in from in return on average common shareholders equity was in  up from in the corporation s operating margin was in compared to in the corporation s operating margin  excluding overnite for was compared to in rail segment net income rail operations reported net income of billion in compared to billion in  up 
the increase in earnings resulted from stronger operating results  the asset sale transactions with the uta and vta  lower interest costs  and a tax adjustment for prior years income tax examinations 
higher operating revenue and lower fuel expense combined with productivity gains and cost control efforts offset inflation and higher volume related costs 
operating revenues operating revenue is comprised of commodity revenue and other revenues 
other revenues primarily include subsidiary revenue from various non railroad companies that are wholly owned or majority owned by the railroad  revenue from the chicago commuter rail operations and accessorial revenue earned due to customer detainment of railroad owned or controlled equipment 
rail operating revenues increased million over to a record billion 
revenue carloads increased primarily driven by growth in the automotive  intermodal and chemicals commodity groups 
other revenue increased million due to increased passenger  subsidiary  and accessorial revenues 
the following tables summarize the year over year changes in rail commodity revenue  revenue carloads and average revenue per car by commodity type commodity revenue in millions of dollars change agricultural   automotive   chemicals   energy   industrial products   intermodal   total   revenue carloads in thousands change agricultural automotive chemicals energy   industrial products   intermodal   total   average revenue per car change agricultural   automotive   chemicals   energy   industrial products   intermodal total   agricultural revenue increased  due to a increase in carloads coupled with a increase in average revenue per car 
meals and oils carloads increased due to strong export demand and more shipments to mexico 
corn shipments to mexico also increased 
revenue gains were also achieved through increased shipments of cottonseed  ethanol used as a fuel additive and frozen french fries 
average revenue per car increased due to a higher average length of haul  resulting from fewer short haul empty storage moves and corn processor shipments combined with increased long haul meals and oils and animal feed shipments 
automotive revenue increased  as a result of a increase in carloads and a increase in average revenue per car 
volume growth resulted from market share gains for finished vehicles  where carloads were up despite a decline in us light vehicle sales 
materials shipments declined  due primarily to reduced production in mexico 
market share gains partially offset the decline 
average revenue per car increased due to a shift in mix of carloads shipped  resulting from increased higher average revenue per car vehicles shipments and a decline in lower average revenue per car materials shipments 
in addition  average length of haul for vehicle shipments increased 
chemicals revenue increased  as a result of a increase in carloads and a decrease in average revenue per car 
volume increased for liquid and dry chemicals due to relatively higher economic demand from industrial manufacturers 
plastics shipments rose as a result of increased demand for consumer durables 
revenue also increased due to higher domestic demand for fertilizer and demand for domestic and export soda ash shipments 
average revenue per car declined due to changes in customer contract terms 
energy energy commodity revenue decreased as average revenue per car declined 
records were set for total carloads and coal trains loaded per day in the southern powder river basin in wyoming 
results were achieved through favorable weather conditions and improved cycle times 
offsetting the volume increase were reduced west coast export shipments originating from the colorado and utah mining regions 
average revenue per car declined due to the impact of contract price negotiations on expiring long term contracts with certain major customers 
industrial products revenue increased  due to a slight increase in carloads coupled with a increase in average revenue per car 
increased lumber shipments were the primary growth driver  due to strong housing construction and greater production in the pacific northwest region 
stone shipments increased due to strong building and road construction activity in the south 
revenue also increased for paper and newsprint commodities due to higher general demand 
reduced shipments of steel and metallic shipments in the first three quarters partially offset these increases 
however  steel shipments rebounded in the fourth quarter as new us tariffs made domestic producers more price competitive with foreign producers 
average revenue per car increased due to price increases and a greater mix of longer average length of haul 
intermodal revenue increased  primarily due to a increase in carloads 
volumes increased due to higher international shipments  resulting from strong import demand and market share gains in some segments 
these gains were partially offset by the labor dispute between the international longshoreman and warehouse union ilwu and the pacific maritime association  which had a significant impact on intermodal volumes during the fourth quarter  primarily in october 
revenue declined for domestic shipments  due to soft market demand and the voluntary action of shedding low margin trailer business in favor of higher margin containers 
the slight increase in average revenue per car was the result of price increases  offset by the mix impact of more lower revenue per car international shipments 
mexico business in and  respectively  uprr generated million and million of revenues from rail traffic with businesses located in mexico  which is included in the rail commodity revenue reported above 
shipments increased for agricultural products  chemicals  and industrial products commodity groups 
increased revenue for agricultural products resulted from higher corn and meal exports as well as increased beer imports 
increased chemicals business consisted of plastics exports  in addition to higher imports and exports of liquid and dry chemicals 
the increase in industrial products resulted from higher imports and exports of steel and scrap and exports of pulp and paper products 
reduced automobile production partially offset these gains resulting in fewer shipments of parts and finished vehicles 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million to billion in the increase in expense is primarily due to inflation  increased volume related costs  contract services  casualty and depreciation expense  partially offset by savings from lower employee force levels  cost control efforts and significantly lower fuel prices 
salaries  wages and employee benefits salaries  wages and employee benefits increased million in to billion 
increases were driven by inflation and volume related costs related to a increase in gross ton miles 
a reduction in employee force levels in conjunction with worker productivity improvements partially offset the inflation and higher volume related costs 
equipment and other rents equipment and other rents primarily includes rental expense the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies  freight car  intermodal and locomotive leases  other specialty equipped vehicle leases  and office and other rentals 
expenses increased million compared to due primarily to higher locomotive leases and volume related costs  partially offset by savings from lower car cycle times the average number of accumulated days per load or cycle that loaded and empty cars from other railroads spend on uprr s system and rental prices for private cars 
the higher locomotive lease expense is due to the railroad s increased leasing of new  more reliable and fuel efficient locomotives 
these new locomotives replaced older  non leased models in the fleet  which helped reduce expenses for depreciation  labor  materials and fuel during the year 
the increase in volume costs is primarily due to increased shipments of finished autos that almost exclusively utilize rented freight cars 
the reduction in car cycle times is attributable to increased volume demand and better car utilization 
depreciation the majority of depreciation relates to track structure  including rail  ties and other track material 
depreciation expense increased million over as a result of higher capital spending in recent years 
capital spending totaled billion in and billion in fuel and utilities fuel and utilities is comprised of locomotive fuel  utilities other than telephone  and gasoline and other fuels 
expenses declined million in the decrease was driven by lower fuel prices and a record low fuel consumption rate  as measured by gallons consumed per thousand gross ton miles 
fuel prices averaged cents per gallon in compared to cents per gallon in including taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads 
the railroad hedged approximately of its fuel consumption for the year  which decreased fuel costs by million 
as of december   expected fuel consumption for is hedged at cents per gallon excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads see note to the consolidated financial statements  item 
materials and supplies materials used for the maintenance of the railroad s track  facilities and equipment is the principal component of materials and supplies expense 
office  small tools and other supplies and the costs of freight services purchased to ship company materials are also included 
expenses decreased million  primarily reflecting a reduction in the number of locomotives overhauled 
materials expense for locomotive overhauls decreased due to the use of new  more reliable locomotives during the past several years  the sale of older units  which required higher maintenance  and increased outsourcing of locomotive maintenance 
partially offsetting the reductions in locomotive overhauls was an increase in cost for freight car repairs 
casualty costs the largest component of casualty costs is personal injury expense 
freight and property damage  insurance  environmental matters and occupational illness expense are also included in casualty costs 
costs increased million compared to  as higher personal injury and insurance costs were partially offset by lower costs for freight damage 
purchased services and other costs purchased services and other costs include the costs of services purchased from outside contractors  state and local taxes  net costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads  transportation and lodging for train crew employees  trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers  leased automobile maintenance expenses  telephone and cellular expense  employee travel expense and computer and other general expenses 
expenses increased million compared to primarily due to increased spending for contract services  jointly operated facilities and state and local taxes 
operating income operating income increased million to a record billion in the operating margin for was  compared to in non operating items interest expense decreased million as a result of lower average debt levels and lower weighted average interest rates in other income increased million due to the sale transactions with the uta and vta 
income taxes increased million in compared to resulting from higher pre tax income levels in partially offset by a tax adjustment for prior years income tax examinations 
trucking segment operating revenues in  trucking revenues rose million to billion 
excluding motor cargo in and  revenue increased million due to an increase in volume of  yield improvements  and higher revenue for special services  partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices in included in the volume improvement was additional business realized as a result of the forced closure of consolidated freightways in september operating expenses trucking operating expenses rose million to billion in excluding motor cargo in and  expenses increased million 
salaries  wages and employee benefits increased million 
excluding motor cargo in and  expenses increased million due to wage and benefit inflation and increased volume costs partially offset by productivity improvements and a reduction in the number of employees 
productivity is measured as total costs related to local  dock  and linehaul operations relative to the total volume shipped 
equipment and other rents increased million 
excluding motor cargo in and  expenses increased million due primarily to the increased use of linehaul rail and contract transportation to handle the additional business of the former consolidated freightways 
depreciation expense increased million compared to excluding motor cargo in and  expense increased million due to purchases of new equipment 
fuel and utilities costs increased million 
excluding motor cargo in and  expenses decreased million as a result of lower fuel prices during the year cents per gallon average in compared to cents per gallon average in  including transportation costs but excluding taxes  and by a decrease in gallons consumed 
for the year ended december   overnite hedged approximately of its fuel consumed for  which decreased fuel prices by million 
as of december   expected fuel consumption for is hedged at cents per gallon excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads 
materials and supplies expense increased million compared to excluding motor cargo in and  expenses decreased million due to lower maintenance and operating supplies expense as a result of cost control measures 
casualty costs increased million 
excluding motor cargo in and  expenses increased million due to higher personal injury and insurance expenses 
purchased services and other costs decreased million 
excluding motor cargo in and  expenses decreased million due to lower general supplies expense  a favorable legal settlement in the second quarter  insourcing of contract programmers  and other cost control measures 
operating income trucking operations generated operating income of million in  an increase of million over excluding motor cargo in and  operating income increased million 
the operating margin was compared to in motor cargo improved the operating margin by percentage points in other product lines other operating losses increased million in compared to operating revenues increased million year over year resulting from operations of a new logistics subsidiary created in the latter part of and increased external revenues from two technology subsidiaries 
operating expenses increased million primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense  pension and retiree benefit costs in  as well as asset write offs at two technology subsidiaries 
compared to results of operations consolidated net income the corporation reported net income of million per basic share and per diluted share in compared to million per basic share and per diluted share in excluding the effect of a million pre tax million after tax charge in related to a work force reduction plan at the railroad  net income was million per basic share and per diluted share 
the increase in net income excluding the work force reduction charge in was due primarily to revenue growth  productivity gains and cost control  lower non operating expense and lower fuel prices 
operating revenues operating revenues increased million to billion in  reflecting growth at the railroad and growth in the trucking segment 
the corporation recognizes transportation revenues on a percentage of completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination 
other revenue is recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations are met 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased million to billion in from billion in excluding the effect of the work force reduction charge in  operating expenses increased million compared to reflecting wage and benefit inflation and higher equipment rents and depreciation expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in employment levels at the railroad  lower fuel prices and cost control efforts 
lower fuel prices in versus reduced fuel expense by million in salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased million compared to excluding the work force reduction charge  salaries  wages and employee benefits increased million  as wage and benefit inflation and volume costs exceeded savings from lower employment levels and improved productivity 
equipment and other rents expense increased million as a result of additional locomotive lease expense and longer car cycle times  which indicates that cars spent more time on the rail system between shipments 
partially offsetting these increases were lower costs due to declines in rail traffic requiring rental of freight cars 
in addition  the railroad experienced lower rental rates  and overnite experienced lower contract transportation costs 
depreciation expense increased million as a result of the railroad s capital spending in recent years which increased the total value of the corporation s assets subject to depreciation see note to the consolidated financial statements  item 
fuel and utilities costs were down million compared to due to lower fuel prices and a lower fuel consumption rate  partially offset by higher gross ton miles at the railroad and losses on fuel hedging activity see note to the consolidated financial statements  item 
materials and supplies expense decreased million primarily due to reduced locomotive repairs and cost control actions 
casualty costs increased million over due to higher insurance  bad debts and environmental expenses 
other costs decreased million as productivity and cost control efforts more than offset higher state and local taxes 
operating income operating income increased million to billion in excluding the effect of the million work force reduction charge in  operating income increased million as revenue growth  productivity gains and lower fuel prices more than offset inflation  increased depreciation expense and higher rail costs due to increased rail volume 
non operating items interest expense decreased million compared to due to lower weighted average debt levels and weighted average interest rates in in  the corporation s weighted average debt level decreased from  million in to  million in the corporation s weighted average interest rate was in as compared to in other income increased million in compared to due primarily to higher real estate sales 
income tax expense increased million in over excluding the effect of the million work force reduction charge on income tax expense in  income taxes for increased million over the increase was a result of higher pre tax income levels in and an increase in the effective tax rate from in to in key measures net income as a percentage of operating revenues increased to in from in net income as a percentage of operating revenues in  excluding the work force reduction charge  was

rail segment net income rail operations reported net income of billion in compared to net income of million in  up 
excluding the work force reduction charge in  net income was million 
the increase in earnings resulted from higher commodity revenue and real estate sales combined with lower fuel expense  interest expense and materials and supplies expense 
these improvements were partially offset by inflation  lower other revenue and higher equipment rent and depreciation expenses 
operating revenues rail operating revenues increased million over to billion 
revenue carloads were flat with an increase in the energy and agricultural commodity groups offset by decreases in the other four commodity groups 
the decrease in other revenue was the result of lower switching  subsidiary and accessorial revenues 
the following tables summarize the year over year changes in rail commodity revenue  revenue carloads and average revenue per car by commodity type commodity revenue in millions of dollars change agricultural   automotive   chemicals   energy   industrial products   intermodal   total   revenue carloads in thousands change agricultural automotive chemicals energy   industrial products   intermodal   total   average revenue per car change agricultural   automotive   chemicals   energy   industrial products   intermodal total   agricultural revenue increased  due primarily to a increase in average revenue per car 
carloads were flat  as higher corn shipments and meals and oils exports were offset by a decrease in demand for domestic and export wheat shipments and a poor sugar beet harvest 
revenue gains were also achieved through increased beer imports from mexico  wine shipments from california to eastern markets  express service of fresh and frozen products and increased demand for cottonseed 
average revenue per car increased due to a longer average length of haul  resulting from fewer short haul wheat and sweetener shipments combined with increased long haul domestic and mexico corn shipments 
automotive revenue declined as a result of a decrease in carloads and a increase in average revenue per car 
materials volumes declined  as the soft economy and a decline in vehicle sales led to high inventories  low industry production and auto plant shutdowns 
total finished vehicle shipments declined only  as industry weakness was mitigated by market share gains 
consumer incentives in the fourth quarter stimulated vehicle sales and helped offset weakness early in the year 
average revenue per car increased due to a shift in mix of materials shipped  resulting from fewer shipments of materials with lower average revenue per car 
additionally  more materials were shipped in boxcars rather than containers  which yield higher average revenue per car than containers 
chemicals revenue declined  due to a decrease in carloads 
volume declines were the result of the soft economy  as reduced demand for consumer durables led to high manufacturer inventories and weak demand for plastics 
reduced industrial manufacturing also depressed demand for liquid and dry chemicals 
fertilizer and phosphate rock revenues decreased as high energy costs early in the year reduced the market for these commodities 
average revenue per car was flat  as the positive impact of fewer low average revenue per car phosphate rock shipments was offset by a decrease in average revenue per car for soda ash shipments 
energy energy commodity revenue increased compared to  due to a increase in carloads 
records were set in for total carloads  revenue and coal trains loaded per day in the southern powder river basin in wyoming and in the coal mining regions of colorado and utah 
these increases were driven by strong utility demand caused by severe winter weather in late and the first quarter of in the first half of the year  demand for coal also increased due to the high cost of alternative fuels  such as natural gas  fuel oil and higher priced eastern sourced coal 
carloads also increased due to gains in market share 
industrial products revenue decreased  as a decline in carloads was partially offset by a increase in average revenue per car 
the decline was mainly the result of the economic slowdown  which had a negative effect on many economically sensitive commodities including steel and paper markets 
steel producers were additionally impacted by high levels of low cost imported steel  which forced plant shutdowns and bankruptcies 
newsprint and fiber revenue declined due to lack of demand for printed advertising 
partially offsetting these declines were increases in construction related commodities  led by stone and cement  as strong building and road construction activity continued in the south and southwestern regions of the country 
lumber volumes increased due to strong housing construction and uncertainty surrounding restrictions on canadian lumber imports 
average revenue per car increased due to price increases and a greater mix of longer average length of haul business 
these gains were partially offset by the impact of increased shipments of stone  which generates lower average revenue per car 
intermodal revenue was flat  as a decline in carloads was offset by a increase in average revenue per car 
the volume decrease was primarily the result of soft economic demand for domestic shipments 
in addition  the voluntary action of shedding low margin trailer business in favor of higher margin containers contributed to the decline 
partially offsetting the domestic declines were increases in international shipments  the result of higher import demand 
the increase in average revenue per car was primarily the result of price increases 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased million to billion in excluding the million work force reduction charge in  operating expenses were essentially flat 
higher expenses as a result of inflation  higher equipment rents expense and depreciation were offset by savings from lower force levels  productivity gains and cost control efforts and lower fuel prices 
salaries  wages and employee benefits salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased million in to billion 
excluding the million work force reduction charge in  salaries  wages and employee benefits expense increased million 
the primary driver of the increase was wage and employee benefits inflation 
a gross ton mile increase also added volume costs 
a reduction in employee force levels as a result of the work force reduction plan offset a significant portion of these higher costs 
equipment and other rents expenses increased million compared to due primarily to higher locomotive lease expense and longer car cycle times 
the higher locomotive lease expense is due to the railroad s increased leasing of new  more reliable and fuel efficient locomotives 
these new locomotives replaced older  non leased models in the fleet  which helped reduce expenses for depreciation  labor  materials and fuel during the year 
the increase in car cycle times is partially attributable to a decline in automotive shipments earlier in the year  which resulted in excess freight cars being stored at assembly plants and unloading facilities 
partially offsetting the increases in expenses were lower volume costs  lower car leases and lower prices for equipment 
the decrease in volume costs was attributable to a decline in carloads in commodity groups such as industrial products and intermodal that utilize a high percentage of rented freight cars 
depreciation depreciation expense increased million over  resulting from capital spending in recent years 
capital spending totaled billion in and in and billion in fuel and utilities expenses decreased million 
the decrease was driven by lower fuel prices and a record low fuel consumption rate  as measured by gallons consumed per thousand gross ton miles 
fuel prices averaged cents per gallon in compared to cents per gallon in  including taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads of cents and cents in and  respectively 
the railroad hedged approximately of its fuel consumption for the year  which increased fuel costs by million 
as of december   expected fuel consumption for is hedged at cents per gallon excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads and for is hedged at cents per gallon excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads see note to the consolidated financial statements  item 
materials and supplies expenses decreased million  reflecting locomotive overhaul reductions and productivity improvements and cost control measures 
locomotive overhauls decreased due to acquisition of new  more reliable locomotives during the year and the sale of older units  which required higher maintenance 
materials and supplies expenses related to car maintenance also declined due to lower business levels in the industrial products and automotive commodity groups 
the cars utilized in these commodity groups normally require more maintenance than the cars utilized within the other commodity groups 
casualty costs costs increased million compared to  as higher insurance  bad debt and environmental expenses were partially offset by lower personal injury costs and lower costs for damaged freight cars 
other costs expenses increased million flat compared to primarily due to higher state and local taxes 
operating income operating income increased million to billion

non operating items non operating expense decreased million compared to real estate sales and net other income increased million 
interest expense decreased million as a result of lower weighted average debt levels in income taxes increased million in compared to excluding the work force reduction charge in  income tax expense increased million 
the increase was a result of higher pre tax income levels in and an increase in the effective tax rate from in to in trucking segment operating revenues in  trucking revenues rose million to  million 
the growth resulted from rate increases  new services and million in incremental revenue due to the acquisition of motor cargo 
tonnage for the year was flat compared to operating expenses trucking operating expenses rose million to  million in salaries  wages and employee benefits increased million due to a increase in employees as well as wage and benefit inflation and enhancements 
fuel and utilities costs decreased million  as a result of lower fuel prices during the year cents per gallon average in compared to cents per gallon average in  including transportation costs and regional pricing spreads  and excluding taxes  partially offset by a increase in gallons consumed 
overnite did not hedge any fuel volume for the year ended december  however  as of december   overnite had hedged approximately of its expected fuel consumption for at an average of cents per gallon  excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads and had hedged approximately of its expected fuel consumption for at an average of cents per gallon excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads 
equipment and other rents decreased million due to decreased use of contract transportation during the year 
high utilization of contract transportation in was necessary due to the teamsters related work stoppage 
casualty costs increased million due to higher bad debt  insurance and cargo loss and damage expenses 
other costs decreased million due to lower expenses related to decreased security related to teamsters matters  legal and employee travel expenses in operating income trucking operations generated operating income of million in  compared to million for the operating ratio increased to  compared to in other product lines other operating losses increased million in compared to operating revenues declined million year over year 
operating expenses increased million due to increased spending at the technology companies to develop new products and services 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the corporation s principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  the sale of receivables  and revolving credit facilities  as well as issuance of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets 
the corporation had billion of credit facilities available  of which there were no borrowings outstanding as of december  the sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements including the maintenance of an investment grade bond rating 
if the corporation s bond rating were to deteriorate  it could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the corporation 
receivables sold as of december  were million 
access to commercial paper is dependent on market conditions 
deterioration of the corporation s operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact the corporation s ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity 
liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on the financial stability of the corporation

contractual obligations and commercial commitments as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  item  as referenced in the tables below  the corporation has contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect the financial condition of the corporation 
however  based on management s assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of the material contractual obligations and commercial commitments of the corporation  including material sources of off balance sheet and structured finance arrangements  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material adverse effect on the corporation s consolidated results of operations  financial condition or liquidity

the corporation has no immediate plans to issue equity securities 
other significant financings during june  uprr entered into a capital lease covering new locomotives 
the related capital lease obligation totaled approximately million and is included in the consolidated statements of financial position as debt see note to the consolidated financial statements  item 
in december  the railroad entered into a synthetic operating lease arrangement to finance a new headquarters building  which will be constructed in omaha  nebraska 
the expected completion date of the building is mid it will total approximately million square feet with approximately  office workspaces 
the cost to construct the new headquarters  including capitalized interest  is approximately million 
the corporation has guaranteed all of the railroad s obligation under this lease 
uprr is the construction agent for the lessor during the construction period 
the railroad has guaranteed  in the event of a loss caused by or resulting from its actions or failures to act as construction agent  of the building related construction costs incurred up to that point during the construction period 
total building related costs incurred and drawn from the lease funding commitments as of december   were approximately million 
accordingly  the railroad s guarantee at december   was approximately million 
as construction continues and additional costs are incurred  this guarantee will increase accordingly 
after construction is complete  uprr will lease the building under an initial term of five years with provisions for renewal for an extended period subject to agreement between the railroad and lessor 
at any time during the lease  the railroad may  at its option  purchase the building at approximately the amount expended by the lessor to construct the building 
if the railroad elects not to purchase the building or renew the lease  the building is returned to the lessor for remarketing  and the railroad has guaranteed a residual value equal to of the total construction related costs 
the guarantee will be approximately million 
other matters personal injury and occupational illness the cost of injuries to employees and others related to railroad activities or in accidents involving the trucking segment is charged to expense based on actuarial estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year 
during  the railroad s reported number of work related injuries that resulted in lost job time decreased compared to the number of injuries reported during  and accidents at grade crossings decreased compared to annual expenses for the corporation s personal injury related events were million in  million in and million in as of december  and  the corporation had a liability of million and million  respectively  accrued for future personal injury costs  of which million and million were recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs 
the railroad has additional amounts accrued for claims related to certain occupational illnesses 
compensation for railroad work related accidents is governed by the federal employers liability act fela 
under fela  damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements 
the railroad offers a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 
environmental costs the corporation generates and transports hazardous and non hazardous waste in its current and former operations  and is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
the corporation has identified approximately sites at which it is or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements 
this includes sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government  of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list 
certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites  consequently  the corporation s ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties  in addition to costs relating to its own activities at each site 
when an environmental issue has been identified with respect to the property owned  leased or otherwise used in the conduct of the corporation s business  the corporation and its consultants perform environmental assessments on such property 
the corporation expenses the cost of the assessments as incurred 
the corporation accrues the cost of remediation where its obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated 
as of december  and  the corporation had a liability of million and million  respectively  accrued for future environmental costs  of which million and million were recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs 
the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites  as well as for ongoing monitoring costs  but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties 
cost estimates are based on information available for each site  financial viability of other potentially responsible parties  and existing technology  laws and regulations 
the corporation believes that it has adequately accrued for its ultimate share of costs at sites subject to joint and several liability 
however  the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved  site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties  the degree of contamination by various wastes  the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites  and or the speculative nature of remediation costs 
the corporation expects to pay out the majority of the december   environmental liability over the next five years  funded by cash generated from operations 
remediation of identified sites previously used in operations  used by tenants or contaminated by former owners required cash spending of million in  million in  and million in the corporation is also engaged in reducing emissions  spills and migration of hazardous materials  and spent cash of million  million and million in   and  respectively  for control and prevention 
in  the corporation anticipates spending million for remediation and million for control and prevention 
the impact of current obligations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of the corporation 
labor matters rail approximately of the railroad s nearly  employees are represented by major rail unions 
national negotiations under the railway labor act to revise the national labor agreements for all crafts began in late in may  the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees bmwe ratified a five year agreement  which included provisions for an annual wage increase based on the consumer price index and progressive health and welfare cost sharing 
in august  the carriers reached a five year agreement with the united transportation union utu for annual wage increases as follows july  july  and july the agreement also established a process for resolving the health and welfare cost sharing issue through arbitration and also provided for the operation of remote control locomotives by trainmen 
the brotherhood of locomotive engineers ble challenged the remote control feature of the utu agreement and a recent arbitration decision held that operation of remote control by utu members in terminals does not violate the ble agreement 
in november  the international brotherhood of boilermakers and blacksmiths ibb reached a five year agreement following the utu wage pattern 
in january  an arbitration award was rendered establishing wage increases and health and welfare employee cost sharing for the transportation communications international union tcu 
contract discussions with the remaining unions are either in negotiation or mediation 
also during  the national mediation board ruled against the utu on its petition for a single operating craft on the kansas city southern railroad 
the ble is now working on a possible merger with the international brotherhood of teamsters teamsters 
trucking during  otc continued to oppose the efforts of the teamsters to unionize otc service centers 
on february   the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit  sitting as a full panel  refused to enforce four bargaining orders issued by the national labor relations board nlrb that would have required otc to bargain with the teamsters  even though the teamsters lost secret ballot elections 
subsequently  the nlrb moved for a judgment against itself to reverse the seven other bargaining orders it had issued  and the fourth circuit entered that judgment 
on october   the nlrb s general counsel dismissed a charge the teamsters had filed in august alleging that otc had been bargaining in bad faith 
otc has not reached any collective bargaining agreement with the teamsters 
on october   the teamsters ended the national strike they had called against otc three years earlier 
the teamsters eight year campaign to organize otc s service centers has become almost entirely dormant  and since october  the teamsters have lost rights to represent of the approximately  employees they had organized 
the teamsters had become the bargaining representative of the employees at of otc s service centers  but the employees at of these locations recently have voted to decertify the teamsters  and the nlrb has officially approved the votes in of those locations 
decertification petitions are pending at four other service centers 
only a single representation petition currently is pending  but due to strike violence charges pending against the teamsters  the nlrb has blocked the teamsters efforts to precipitate an election 
in all  the teamsters currently represent approximately of otc s  employees 
employees at two motor cargo service centers located in north salt lake  utah and reno  nevada  representing approximately of motor cargo s total work force at service centers  are covered by two separate collective bargaining agreements with unions affiliated with the teamsters 
although the agreements cover most of the employees at these two facilities  less than half of these covered employees are actual members of unions 
inflation the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation has significantly increased asset replacement costs for capital intensive companies such as the railroad  otc and motor cargo 
as a result  depreciation charges on an inflation adjusted basis  assuming that all operating assets are replaced at current price levels  would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 
derivative financial instruments the corporation and its subsidiaries use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and to achieve the corporation s interest rate objectives 
the corporation uses swaps  futures and or forward contracts to mitigate the downside risk of adverse price movements and hedge the exposure to variable cash flows 
the use of these instruments also limits future gains from favorable movements 
the corporation uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate changes 
the purpose of these programs is to protect the corporation s operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or interest rate fluctuations 
the corporation may also use swaptions to secure near term swap prices 
swaptions are swaps that are extendable past their base period at the option of the counterparty 
swaptions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market through the consolidated statements of income 
market and credit risk the corporation addresses market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying item being hedged 
credit risk related to derivative financial instruments  which is minimal  is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements 
at december   the corporation has not been required to provide collateral  nor has upc received collateral relating to its hedging activities 
in addition  the corporation enters into secured financings in which the debtor has pledged collateral 
the collateral is based upon the nature of the financing and the credit risk of the debtor 
the corporation generally is not permitted to sell or repledge the collateral unless the debtor defaults 
determination of fair value the fair values of the corporation s derivative financial instrument positions at december  and  were determined based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable us treasury rate  london interbank offered rates libor or swap spread 
sensitivity analyses the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates or fuel prices could have on the corporation s financial instruments 
these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 
interest rates the corporation manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within its debt portfolio over a given period 
the mix of fixed and floating rate debt is largely managed through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as incremental borrowings are required 
derivatives are used as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix 
in addition  the corporation also obtains flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within its debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed rate debt securities 
at december  and  the corporation had variable rate debt representing approximately of its total debt 
if variable interest rates average higher in than the corporation s december  variable rate  which was approximately  the corporation s interest expense would increase by less than million after tax 
if variable interest rates had averaged higher in than the corporation s december  variable rate  the corporation s interest expense would have increased by less than million after tax 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of the corporation s variable rate debt at december  and  respectively 
swaps allow the corporation to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt s fair value attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate libor 
the swaps have been accounted for using the short cut method as allowed by financial accounting standard fas  therefore  no ineffectiveness has been recorded within the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the corporation entered into an interest rate swap on million of debt with a maturity date of december in may  the corporation entered into an interest rate swap on million of debt with a maturity date of february this swap contained a call option that matches the call option of the underlying hedged debt  as allowed by fas in january  the swap s counterparty exercised their option to cancel the swap  effective february  similarly  the corporation has exercised its option to redeem the underlying debt 
as of december  and  the corporation had approximately million and million of interest rate swaps  respectively 
the effect of a interest rate increase or decrease in over the december  rates is included in the preceding and succeeding paragraph disclosure  respectively 
market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates as of december   and amounts to approximately million at december  market risk resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates as of december   amounted to approximately million at december  the fair values of the corporation s fixed rate debt were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 
fuel fuel costs are a significant portion of the corporation s total operating expenses 
as a result of the significance of fuel costs and the historical volatility of fuel prices  the corporation s transportation subsidiaries periodically use swaps  futures and or forward contracts to mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes 
the corporation at times may use swaptions to secure more favorable swap prices 
as of december   expected rail fuel consumption for is hedged at cents per gallon  excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads 
as of december   the railroad has no outstanding hedges for based on annualized fuel consumption during  and excluding the impact of the hedging program  each one cent increase in the price of fuel would have resulted in approximately million of additional fuel expense  after tax 
as of december   the corporation had hedged approximately of its forecasted fuel consumption and of its forecasted fuel consumption at cents per gallon  excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads 
as of december   expected trucking fuel consumption for is hedged at cents per gallon  excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads 
as of december   there are no outstanding hedges for based on annualized fuel consumption during  and excluding the impact of the hedging program  each one cent increase in the price of fuel would have resulted in approximately  of additional fuel expense  after tax 
as of december   the corporation had hedged approximately of its forecasted trucking fuel consumption and of its forecasted fuel consumption at cents per gallon  excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads 
accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas

in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fas 
fas provides alternative methods of transition for voluntary changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and amends the disclosure requirements including a requirement for interim disclosures

in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  item  the railroad has a synthetic operating lease arrangement to finance a new headquarters building  which falls within the guidance of fin in accordance with fin  the railroad will either consolidate  restructure or refinance the synthetic lease prior to july  the corporation does not expect fin to have any impact on the treatment of the sale of receivables program as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  item commitments and contingencies there are various claims and lawsuits pending against the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries 
the corporation is also subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  pursuant to which it is currently participating in the investigation and remediation of various sites 
a discussion of certain claims  lawsuits  contingent liabilities and guarantees is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements  item pensions during the second quarter of  the corporation decreased its assumed rate of return on pension plan assets from to 
this assumption change resulted in an increase to pension expense of million 
in addition  due to declines on plan assets  a minimum pension liability adjustment was recorded during the fourth quarter of this adjustment resulted in a reduction of common shareholders equity 
the reduction in equity totaled million  after tax approximately of total equity 
otc voluntarily contributed million to its pension plan during the railroad voluntarily contributed million to its pension plan during the fourth quarter of the corporation currently does not have any minimum funding requirements  as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws  however  upc plans to voluntarily contribute approximately million during required contributions subsequent to are dependent on asset returns  current discount rates and a number of other factors  however  the corporation expects to continue discretionary funding to help manage any potential required funding in the future 
future contributions are expected to be funded primarily by cash generated from operating activities 
dividend receivable the railroad owns a interest in grupo ferroviario mexicano  sa de sa gfm 
gfm operates a major railway system in mexico 
during the third quarter of  the railroad recorded a dividend from gfm of approximately million 
as of december   the dividend is reflected as a receivable in the corporation s consolidated statements of financial position 
the dividend is accounted for as a reduction to investments in and advances to affiliated companies in the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  and creates no effect on the corporation s consolidated statements of income 
during the fourth quarter  the railroad received approximately million of the dividend receivable  and anticipates it will receive the remainder of the dividend during west coast port disruption during september of  the labor dispute between the international longshoreman and warehouse union ilwu and the pacific maritime association escalated and resulted in work slow downs and a lockout of the ilwu dockworkers for four days at the end of the third quarter and continued for nine days into the fourth quarter of the estimated impact on fourth quarter earnings is approximately cents per share  resulting mainly from international intermodal shipments diverted to trucks and suspended shipments due to vessel scheduling disruptions 
railroad retirement reform on december   the railroad retirement and survivors improvement act of the act was signed into law 
the act was a result of historic cooperation between rail management and labor  and provides improved railroad retirement benefits for employees and reduced payroll taxes for employers 
the estimated savings to the railroad during from passage of the act was million  pre tax  in reduced employer payroll taxes 
incremental savings are expected in as the employer tax rate is further reduced by percentage points from to 
work force reduction during  the corporation is planning to reduce approximately  administrative positions  through a combination of attrition and involuntary severance 
the estimated severance cost is million  pre tax  the majority of which should occur in the first quarter of a look forward business outlook rail the railroad expects to build on the positive momentum generated in the past several years and continue to grow revenue  operating income and free cash flow 
free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid 
year over year revenue growth is projected in all commodity groups with the largest percentage increases projected in the intermodal  agricultural and industrial groups 
revenue derived from chemical and energy shipments is expected to increase steadily over automotive revenue is also expected to increase slightly from last year s record setting pace  thereby continuing as a strong revenue provider 
the railroad will continue to focus on improving service performance while developing new  innovative rail service offerings to meet the changing needs of its customers 
while operating expenses will likely increase for such items as insurance  pension  operating taxes and minimum guaranteed payments to union employees  cost controls and continuing improvements in productivity will remain a focus to drive the operating ratio lower 
fuel price will remain susceptible to near term volatile price swings 
to help reduce the impact of fuel price volatility on earnings  the railroad will continue to look for opportunities to use hedge contracts 
trucking overnite expects financial performance to further improve upon its positive results 
solid revenue growth is projected  in part due to additional business resulting from the forced closure of consolidated freightways 
cost controls and productivity improvements are projected to positively impact operating expenses  which will mitigate the impact of inflationary pressures and volatile fuel prices 
overnite will continue to offer reliable on time performance and quality service  which should enable overnite to maintain profitable margins 
capital investments the corporation s capital expenditures and debt service requirements are expected to be funded through cash generated from operations  additional debt financings and the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties 
the corporation expects that these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet cash requirements in the foreseeable future 
in  the corporation expects to spend approximately to billion on capital expenditures 
these capital expenditures will be used to maintain track and structures  continue capacity expansions on the railroad s main lines  upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs  build infrastructure and develop and implement new technologies 
otc and motor cargo will continue to maintain their truck fleet  expand service centers and enhance technology
