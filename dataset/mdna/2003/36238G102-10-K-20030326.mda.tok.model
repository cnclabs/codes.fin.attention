the terms of these sales are comparable to those with our other business to business partners  and the amount included in accounts receivable as a result of these sales was  as of december  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting polices  which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
accounting for inventory inventory  primarily consisting of sporting goods  athletic equipment  footwear  apparel and consumer electronics is valued at the lower of cost or market 
inherent in this valuation are significant management judgments and estimates  including among others  assessments concerning obsolescence and shrinkage rates 
based upon these judgments and estimates  which are applied consistently from period to period  we record a valuation allowance to adjust the carrying amount of our inventory 
accounting for goodwill and certain other intangibles we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations as of july  we accounted for our acquisition of ashford under sfas no 
effective december   we adopted the provisions of sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under an impairment only approach  goodwill and certain intangibles are not amortized into results of operations but instead  are reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than their fair value 
sfas no 

table of contents requires us to complete a two step impairment test of goodwill 
the first step  which was required to be completed by june   was to determine if an impairment existed 
the second step  which was required to be completed by december  if necessary  was to measure the impairment 
as part of the impairment test  we obtained an independent  third party valuation in order to determine if the fair value of our recorded goodwill was impaired 
the valuation incorporated a variety of methodologies to estimate fair value  including comparing our market capitalization with that of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business  applying price multiples to our estimated future operating results and estimating discounted cash flows 
we completed the first step of the impairment test during the second quarter of fiscal and found no instances of impairment of our recorded goodwill 
therefore  the second step of the impairment test was not necessary during fiscal in addition  upon adoption of sfas no 
 we evaluated our goodwill and intangibles acquired prior to june  using the criteria in sfas no 
and determined that no change in previously recognized goodwill was required 
in connection with the sale of certain assets of ashford  we disposed of million of goodwill associated with the ashford acquisition 
we determined that our remaining million of goodwill should be tested for impairment 
as part of the impairment test  we obtained an independent  third party valuation in order to determine if the fair value of our remaining recorded goodwill was impaired 
the valuation incorporated a variety of methodologies to estimate fair value  including comparing our market capitalization with that of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business  applying price multiples to our estimated future operating results and estimating discounted cash flows 
we completed the impairment test in december and found no instances of impairment of our remaining recorded goodwill 
accounting for long lived assets the ability to realize long lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including undiscounted cash flow and profitability projections that incorporate  as applicable  the impact on the existing business 
the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment 
any impairment loss  if indicated  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that certain long lived assets were no longer being used in our continuing operations and  therefore  that the carrying amounts of these assets were not recoverable 
the long lived assets consisted of furniture and computer hardware and software 
we disposed of these assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded an impairment charge of  which is included in depreciation and amortization expense 
accounting for notes receivable notes receivable consists primarily of a million  five year subordinated secured promissory note  with a stated interest rate of  received in connection with the sale of certain assets of ashford 
the note is due in twenty consecutive quarterly principal payments of  each  beginning march through december accrued interest on the note is payable with each quarterly principal payment 
in order to determine the fair value of the note  we obtained an independent  third party valuation 
based upon the valuation  we determined that the market interest rate of the note is and therefore valued the note at approximately million 
the  discount will be amortized over the term of the note and recorded as an increase in interest income 
accounting for other equity investments other equity investments consist of shares of  and warrants to purchase odimo series d preferred stock convertible into of the fully diluted common shares of odimo  received in connection with the sale of certain assets of ashford 
we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over odimo and therefore the investment is accounted for under the cost method 
under the cost method of accounting  investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value  distributions of earnings and additional investments 
the initial cost of our investment was determined based on 
table of contents the fair value of the investment at the time of its acquisition 
as an observable market price does not exist for equity securities of private companies  estimates of fair value of such securities are more subjective than for securities of public companies 
in order to determine the fair value of the investment in odimo  we obtained an independent  third party valuation 
the valuation incorporated a variety of methodologies to estimate fair value  including comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business  applying price multiples to estimated future operating results for odimo and estimating discounted cash flows 
factors affecting the valuation included restrictions on control and marketability of odimo s equity securities and other information available to us  such as our knowledge of the industry and knowledge of specific information about odimo 
using this valuation  we determined the estimated fair value of the investment to be approximately million 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales or services provided when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from product sales  net of estimated returns based on historical experience and current trends  upon shipment of products to customers 
we ship the majority of products from our fulfillment center in louisville  ky 
in fiscal  we also shipped products from our former jewelry and luxury goods fulfillment center in houston  tx 
we also rely upon certain vendors to ship products to customers 
we act as principal in these transactions  as orders are initiated directly through the e commerce businesses that we operate  we take title to the goods at the shipping point and have the economic risk related to collection  customer service and returns 
we consider the criteria presented in eitf  no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining the appropriate revenue recognition treatment 
generally  when we are the primary obligor in a transaction  have general inventory risk  have established the selling price  have discretion in supplier selection  have physical loss inventory risk after order placement or during shipping and have credit risk  or have several but not all of these indicators  we record revenue gross as a principal 
we pay a percentage of the revenues generated from the sale of products through the e commerce businesses that we operate to our respective partners in exchange for the rights to use their brand names and the promotions and advertising that our partners agree to provide 
we refer to these royalty payments as partner revenue share charges 
we have considered the revenue reduction provisions addressed in eitf no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  and believe that the payment of partner revenue share charges  or the issuance of warrants or stock in lieu of cash partner revenue share charges  to our partners should not result in any reduction of revenues 
eitf addresses consideration paid to parties along a distribution chain 
we purchase merchandise from our vendors  at our discretion  and we are responsible for paying those vendors 
the amounts purchased and the prices paid to our vendors are not impacted by the revenue share provisions of our agreements with our partners 
accordingly  our partners and our vendors are not linked in the distribution chain and the provisions of eitf no 
do not apply 
we recognize revenue from services provided as the services are rendered 
if we receive payments for services in advance  these amounts are deferred and then recognized over the service period 
deferred revenue consists primarily of fees paid in advance to us as of the respective balance sheet date under an agreement to manage certain aspects of a partner s overall e commerce business  including fulfillment  technology and customer service 
deferred revenue also consists of amounts received from the sale of gift certificates redeemable through our partners e commerce businesses 
accounting for internal use computer software and web site development costs we account for internal use computer software and web site development costs in accordance with the aicpa accounting standards executive committee s statement of position  accounting for the costs of 
table of contents computer software developed or obtained for internal use  and eitf  accounting for web site development costs 
accordingly  we generally capitalize costs incurred to develop internal use computer software during the application development stage  including those relating to developing our partners web sites 
we also capitalize costs of enhancements to internal use computer software  provided that these enhancements result in additional functionality 
we depreciate capitalized costs using the straight line method over their useful lives  which are based on management s estimate of the useful life of the underlying asset 
during the first quarter of fiscal  management increased its estimate of the useful lives of these capitalized costs from two years to four years 
this change had the effect of decreasing the loss from continuing operations for fiscal by million  or per share  and for fiscal by million  or per share  respectively 
this increase was based on management s then current analysis of our historical operating experience  which indicated that the original estimate was no longer appropriate 
accounting for restructuring costs restructuring costs  which include termination benefits  contractual obligations  asset impairments and other restructuring costs are recorded at estimated fair value 
key assumptions in calculating the restructuring costs included the timing of employee terminations and estimates of the expected salvage value of assets held for disposal 
we will review these reserves periodically and adjust them if necessary 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for stock options granted to employees under our incentive and non incentive stock option plans using the intrinsic method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation expense for stock options issued to employees is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we account for stock options and warrants issued to non employees using the fair value method prescribed in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and in accordance with the provisions of eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and eitf no 
 accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employees 
accordingly  compensation expense for stock options and warrants issued to non employees is measured using a black scholes multiple option pricing model that takes into account assumptions as to the expected life of the option or warrant  the expected volatility of our common stock and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option or warrant

certain consideration received from a vendor in november  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
eitf addresses the accounting of cash consideration received by a customer from a vendor  including vendor rebates and refunds 
the consensus reached states that consideration received should be presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products or services and should therefore be shown as a reduction of cost of sales in the income statement of the customer 
the presumption could be overcome if the vendor receives an identifiable benefit in exchange for the consideration or the consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by the customer in selling the vendor s product or service 
if one of these conditions is met  the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of those costs in the income statement of the customer 
the consensus reached also concludes that if rebates or refunds can be reasonably estimated  such rebates or refunds should be recognized as a reduction of the cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation of the consideration to be received relative to the transactions that mark the progress of the customer toward earning the rebate or refund 
we do not expect the provisions of this consensus to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations
