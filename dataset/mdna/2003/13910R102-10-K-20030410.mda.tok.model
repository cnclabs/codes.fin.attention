the company also provides management services to the farmersville municipal electric system which services nearly  meters in farmersville  texas 
the company purchases power for resale to its retail customers from wholesale suppliers and distributes that power to its customers over transmission lines covering over miles and then over  miles of distribution lines 
the company has not and does not plan to engage in the generation of electricity 
the company s primary focus is on the distribution of electricity to its customers 
in  the company purchased all electric power pursuant to wholesale electric power contracts with southwestern public service company  dynegy power marketing  inc  lower colorado river authority and garland power and light 
generally  the wholesale electric power supply contracts are based on fixed charges for kwh usage  transportation and auxiliary services and a variable charge for fuel based on kwh usage 
the company s purchased power costs fluctuate primarily with the price of natural gas 
however  all costs associated with purchased power are passed through to the retail customer 
the board of directors adopted a resolution changing the date of the company s and the cooperative s fiscal year end from march to december  effective for the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  that could have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial estimates are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in the financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the board of directors audit committee 
the company s most significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s most critical accounting policy involves rate regulation 
the company is subject to the provisions of financial accounting standards board sfas statement no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
in certain circumstances  sfas no 
requires that certain costs and or obligations be reflected in a deferral account on the balance sheet and not reflected in the statement of income or loss until matching revenues are recognized 
it is the company s policy to assess the recoverability of costs recognized as regulatory assets and company s ability to continue to account for its activities in accordance with sfas no 
 based on each regulatory action and the criteria set forth in sfas no 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  management analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current customer payment performance and current economic trends 
for the year ended december   nine months ended december  and year ended march   the bad debt expense was less than one tenth of one percent of electric sales in each respective year 
our accounts receivable balance was  and  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  at december  and  respectively 
power cost recovery factor 
the power cost recovery factor is the difference between the cost of purchased power and the cost recovered from the customers  divided by the number of kilowatt hours billed during the period 
this factor is estimated each month to recover actual costs and is added to the base rate 
the factor is based on estimates of power cost increases decreases due to increases decreases in fuel cost  usage and other cost fluctuations 
the estimate is adjusted in the subsequent month as compared to actual activity 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company enters into derivative transactions to manage the cost of natural gas as the fuel component of power cost 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the pricing under the company s various power contracts varies with fuel cost  which is generally determined by the cost of natural gas 
these transactions minimize the fluctuations in their customers power bills 
the instruments are measured at fair market value and recorded as an asset or liability with a corresponding regulatory asset or liability 
changes in the fair value are recognized in current earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
revenue recognition policy 
for all periods through december   the company and its predecessor  the cooperative  utilized the cycle billing method to recognize revenue  pursuant to the rate making policy as set by the board of directors 
the cycle billing method recognizes revenue on an as billed basis which recognizes revenue when the customer is billed and not on an accrual basis  which recognizes revenue as the power is distributed to the customer 
by utilizing the as billed method  unbilled revenue is not recognized 
in the utility industry  the rate making policy defines the accounting requirements according to sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulations 
effective january   the company s board of directors changed the rate making policy to recognize unbilled revenue 
at such time  the company will be required to change accounting principles related to its revenue recognition method 
under the new rate making structure  the company will recognize revenue when power is distributed to the customer rather than when the customer is billed

commodity price risk all purchases of electricity are pursuant to long term wholesale electric power contracts based on a fixed price for kwh usage  transportation and auxiliary services and a variable charge for fuel cost  which is generally natural gas 
all of the actual costs associated with the purchase of electricity are able to be recovered from billings to our customers  which mitigates most of the risk of variations in gas costs 
in the first quarter of  the company entered into two derivative transactions to fix a portion of the natural gas component of the related power costs over the next twelve months to minimize the fluctuations in their customer s power bills 
these transactions fixed the price on approximately  to  mmbtus of natural gas at fixed prices ranging from to an mmbtu 
all payments made or received in connection with these transactions were collected or rebated to the customers through the power cost recovery component of the customers power bills 
the last derivative contract expired in may the company uses this type of instrument to manage costs for its customers 
credit risk the company s concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash  trade accounts receivable  sales concentrations with certain customers and a note receivable from a third party 
credit risk with financial institutions is considered minimal because of the number and various physical locations of different financial institutions utilized

the company conducts credit evaluations of new customers and assesses the need for a deposit by that customer

in order to take advantage of the interest rate environment in late as well as employ an interest rate management strategy  the company fixed the interest rates on  of its debt at for a period of one year  on  at for a period of two years and on  at for a period of three years 
at december   there was  at an average variable rate of and  at a fixed rate of
