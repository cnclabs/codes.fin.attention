the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods 
estimates have been made by management in several areas  including  but not limited to  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  the realizability of deferred tax assets  goodwill and other intangible assets and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company records revenue in accordance with statement of position software revenue recognition sop  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants as modified by statement of position and sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition in financial statements sab regarding revenue recognition in financial statements 
sop provides additional guidance with respect to multiple element arrangements  returns  exchanges  and platform transfer rights  resellers  services  funded software development arrangements  and contract accounting 
accordingly  revenue from the sale of hardware is recognized within product revenue at the time of delivery and acceptance of hardware products by the customer  when the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
maintenance or monitoring revenue that is bundled with an initial license fee is deferred and recognized ratably within service revenue over the maintenance or monitoring period in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
amounts deferred for maintenance or monitoring are based on the fair value of equivalent maintenance or monitoring services sold separately 
the company has established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe on all undelivered elements of its software arrangements  which consists of maintenance  monitoring and  at times  training and consulting 
the company uses the residual method for delivered elements 
the company s consulting and training projects are short term in nature and are recorded as revenue when the services have been rendered 
revenues from nnsi generated from the resale of long distance services are recognized as services are provided 
revenues from nnsi primarily consist of monthly fees  which are recognized over the monthly period and long distance charges  which are recognized as incurred 
these revenues are included within product revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
revenue for shipping and handling are included within products revenue and the related costs are included in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company provides allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of customers to satisfy their accounts as originally contemplated at the time of sale and charges actual losses to the allowance when incurred 
the calculation for these allowances is based on the detailed review of certain individual customer accounts  historical satisfaction rates and the company s estimation of the overall economic conditions affecting the company s customer base 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to prepare our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we have fully reserved our deferred tax assets at june  and goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles of each of our reporting units as required under sfas by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information 
we apply our best judgment when assessing the reasonableness of the financial projections used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
stock based compensation the company applies the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  to account for stock based employee compensation plans and reports pro forma disclosures by estimating the fair value of options issued and the related expense in accordance with sfas under this method  compensation cost is recognized for awards of shares of common stock or stock options to directors  officers and employees of the company only if the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date or other measurement date  if later is greater than the amount the grantee must pay to acquire the stock
