debt at december   we had million of debt outstanding comprised of capital securities due december  issued in december by bay view capital i  a delaware business trust we sponsor 
the capital securities are callable at par on december  competition due to limited nature of our current operations and the active implementation of our plan of dissolution and stockholder liquidity  our auto finance group is the only area of our business affected by competition 
the competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation  including the financial services modernization act  changes in technology and product delivery systems  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
we compete for loans with commercial banks  finance companies and credit unions 
many of these competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization  have greater access to existing and newly emerging capital markets and offer a broader range of financial services than bay view 
in addition  recent federal legislation may have the effect of further increasing the pace of consolidation within the financial services industry 
economic conditions  government policies and legislation our profitability  like most financial institutions  is dependent on interest rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rates we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings  and the interest rates we receive on our interest earning assets  such as loans  leases and securities  comprises a significant portion of our earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  such as inflation  recession and unemployment and the impact of future changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions that we cannot predict
