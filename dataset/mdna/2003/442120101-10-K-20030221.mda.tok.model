item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as discussed in notes to the consolidated financial statements note restatement and reclassifications  the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restated 
the restatements have no effect on income from operations or net income 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects this restatement 
general we are an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the exploration  development  exploitation and acquisition of domestic natural gas and oil properties 
our operations are primarily focused in south texas  offshore in the gulf of mexico and in the arkoma basin of oklahoma and arkansas 
at december   our net proved reserves were billion cubic feet equivalent or bcfe  with a present value  discounted at per annum  of cash flows before income taxes of billion 
our reserves are fully engineered on an annual basis by independent petroleum engineers 
our focus is natural gas 
approximately of our net proved reserves at december  were natural gas  approximately of which were classified as proved developed 
we operate approximately of our properties 
during the year ended december  we drilled a total of wells of which were successful reflecting a success rate of 
we produced a total of billion cubic feet equivalent  or bcfe  and increased our average daily production during the year by to million cubic feet equivalent  or mmcfe  per day 
we replaced of our production by adding bcfe in net proved reserves 
we generated million in cash flows from operations before adjustments for changes in current assets and liabilities and invested a net million in natural gas and oil properties  including million for producing properties acquired in south texas and the gulf of mexico 
we began exploring for natural gas and oil in december on behalf of the brooklyn union gas company 
brooklyn union is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of keyspan corporation 
keyspan  a member of the standard poor s index  is a diversified energy provider whose principal natural gas distribution and electric generation operations are located in the northeastern united states 
in september we completed our initial public offering and sold approximately of our shares to the public with keyspan retaining the balance 
as of december   thec holdings corp  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of keyspan  owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as an independent oil and gas producer  our revenue  profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for natural gas and oil  our ability to find and produce natural gas and oil and our ability to control and reduce costs  all of which are dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
the energy markets have historically been very volatile and commodity prices may fluctuate widely in the future 
a substantial or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows  quantities of natural gas and oil reserves that may be economically produced and access to capital 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates revenue recognition and gas imbalances 
we use the entitlements method of accounting for the recognition of natural gas and oil revenues 
under this method of accounting  income is recorded based on our net revenue interest in production or nominated deliveries 
we incur production gas volume imbalances in the ordinary course of business 
net deliveries in excess of entitled amounts are recorded as liabilities  while net under deliveries are reflected as assets 
imbalances are reduced either by subsequent recoupment of over and under deliveries or by cash settlement  as required by applicable contracts 
hedging activities 
on january   we adopted statementsof financial accounting standards no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
our hedges are cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
and  accordingly  we carry the fair market value of our derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and defer unrealized gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income 
gains and losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement as a component of natural gas and oil revenues in the period the hedged production occurs 
if any ineffectiveness occurs  amounts are recorded directly to other income or expense 
full cost accounting 
we use the full cost method to account for our natural gas and oil properties 
under full cost accounting  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of natural gas and oil reserves are capitalized into a full cost pool 
capitalized costs include costs of all unproved properties  internal costs directly related to our natural gas and oil activities and capitalized interest 
we amortize these costs using a unit of production method 
we compute the provision for depreciation  depletion and amortization quarterly by multiplying production for the quarter by a depletion rate 
the depletion rate is determined by dividing our total unamortized cost base by net equivalent proved reserves at the beginning of the quarter 
our total unamortized cost base is the sum of i our full cost pool  less ii our unevaluated properties and their related costs which are excluded from the amortization base until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves  plus iii estimates for future development costs as well as future abandonment and dismantlement costs 
we review our unevaluated properties at the end of each quarter to determine if the costs incurred should be reclassified to the full cost pool and thereby subject to amortization 
sales of natural gas and oil properties are accounted for as adjustments to the full cost pool  with no gain or loss recognized  unless the adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
under full cost accounting rules  total capitalized costs are limited to a ceiling equal to the present value of future net revenues  discounted at per annum  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties less income tax effects the ceiling limitation 
we perform a quarterly ceiling test to evaluate whether the net book value of our full cost pool exceeds the ceiling limitation 
if capitalized costs net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization less deferred taxes are greater than the discounted future net revenues or ceiling limitation  a writedown or impairment of the full cost pool is required 
a writedown of the carrying value of the full cost pool is a non cash charge that reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and typically results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
once incurred  a writedown is not reversible at a later date 
the ceiling test is calculated using natural gas and oil prices in effect as of the balance sheet date  held constant over the life of the reserves 
we use derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
to hedge against the volatility of natural gas prices  and in accordance with current securities and exchange commission guidelines  we include estimated future cash flows from our hedging program in our ceiling test calculation 
in calculating our ceiling test at december   we estimated that we had a full cost ceiling cushion  whereby the carrying value of our full cost pool was less than the ceiling limitation 
no writedown is required when a cushion exists 
natural gas prices continue to be volatile and the risk that we will be required to write down our full cost pool increases when natural gas prices are depressed or if we have significant downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves 
use of estimates 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
our most significant financial estimates are based on remaining proved natural gas and oil reserves 
estimates of proved reserves are key components of our depletion rate for natural gas and oil properties and our full cost ceiling limitation 
natural gas and oil reserve quantities represent estimates only 
under full cost accounting  we use reserve estimates to determine our full cost ceiling limitation as well as our depletion rate 
we estimate our proved reserves and future net revenues using sales prices estimated to be in effect as of the date we make the reserve estimates 
we hold the estimates constant throughout the life of the properties  except to the extent a contract specifically provides for escalation 
natural gas prices  which have fluctuated widely in recent years  affect estimated quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues 
further  any estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and their values are inherently uncertain for numerous reasons  including many factors beyond our control 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
in addition  estimates of reserves may be revised based upon actual production  results of future development and exploration activities  prevailing natural gas and oil prices  operating costs and other factors  and these revisions may be material 
reserve estimates are highly dependent upon the accuracy of the underlying assumptions 
actual future production may be materially different from estimated reserve quantities and the differences could materially affect future amortization of natural gas and oil properties 
accounting for stock option expense 
for the years ended december   and  we accounted for stock options using the intrinsic value method prescribed under accounting principles board opinion and accordingly  we did not recognize compensation expense for stock options 
on january   we adopted the fair value expense recognition provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation and as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
proposes three alternatives transition methods for adopting the fair value method under sfas no 
o prospective method recognize fair value expense for all awards granted in the year of adoption but not previous awards  o modified prospective method recognize fair value expense for the unvested portion of all stock options granted  modified  or settled since ie  the unvested portion of the prior awards or those granted in the year of adoption must be recorded using the fair value method  and o retroactive restatement method similar to the modified prospective method except that all prior periods are restated 
we adopted sfas no 
using the prospective method and as a result will record as compensation expense the fair value of all stock options issued subsequent to january  we do not expect the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
takes effect january  sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
for all periods presented  we have included estimated future costs of abandonment and dismantlement in our full cost amortization base and amortize these costs as a component of our depletion expense 
we have completed our assessment of sfas no 
at december   we estimate that the present value of our future asset retirement obligation aro for natural gas and oil property and related equipment is approximately million 
we estimate that the cumulative effect of our adoption of sfas no 
and the change in the accounting principle will be a charge to net income during the first quarter of of million  million net of taxes 
in april the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 no 
 and no 
 amendment to fasb statement no 
and technical corrections 
sfas no 
streamlines the reporting of debt extinguishments and requires that only gains and losses from extinguishments meeting the criteria in accounting policies board opinion would be classified as extraordinary 
thus  gains or losses arising from extinguishments that are part of a company s recurring operations would not be reported as an extraordinary item 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  at this time  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities was issued in september and addresses accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
under sfas no  fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  at this time  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure was issued in december and the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions are effective for us for the year ended december  sfas no 
amends sfas statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  the statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used 
we adopted sfas no 
for and on january   we adopted the fair value expense recognition provisions of sfas no 
on a prospective basis and as a result  we will record as compensation expense the fair value of all stock options issued subsequent to january  acquisitions keyspan joint venture assets 
on october   we purchased from keyspan a portion of the assets developed under the joint exploration agreement with keyspan exploration production  llc  a subsidiary of keyspan 
the acquisition consisted of interests averaging between and in wells covering eight of the twelve blocks that were developed under the joint exploration agreement from through the interests purchased were in the following blocks vermilion  east cameron and  high island  galveston island and  matagorda island and north padre island keyspan has retained its interest in four blocks south timbalier and and mustang island and  as these blocks are in various stages of development 
keyspan has committed to continued participation in the ongoing development of these blocks including the completion of the platform and production facilities at south timbalier together with possible further developmental drilling at both south timbalier and mustang island as of september   the effective date of the purchase  the estimated proved reserves associated with the interests acquired were bcfe 
the million purchase price was paid in cash and financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
subsequent purchase price adjustments totaled million 
our acquisition of the properties was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control 
as a result  the excess fair value of the properties acquired of million million net of tax was treated as a capital contribution from keyspan and recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital during the fourth quarter of our board of directors appointed a special committee  comprised entirely of independent directors to review the proposed transaction with keyspan 
for assistance  the special committee retained special outside legal counsel as well as the financial advisory firm of petrie parkman co 
in addition  the special committee discussed the history and terms of the transaction with our senior management 
after completing its review  the special committee unanimously concluded that the transaction was advisable and in our best interests and that the terms of the transaction were at least as favorable to us as terms that would have been obtainable at the time in a comparable transaction with an unaffiliated party 
in reaching its decision  the special committee considered numerous factors in consultation with its financial and legal advisors 
the special committee also took into account the opinion delivered to it by petrie parkman co 
to the effect that the consideration to be paid by us in the transaction was fair to us from a financial point of view 
burlington acquisition 
on may   we completed the purchase of natural gas and oil producing properties  together with undeveloped acreage  from burlington resources inc located in the webb and jim hogg counties of south texas 
the properties purchased cover approximately  gross  net acres located in the north east thompsonville and south laredo fields 
the properties purchased represent interests in approximately producing wells and total proved reserves of bcfe as of january   the effective date of the transaction 
the north east thompsonville field has wells producing from the wilcox formation  all of which we operate 
this field represents approximately of the proved reserves and of the current production associated with the acquisition 
the south laredo field  located in webb county and in the lobo trend  contains wells  all operated by a third party 
the million purchase price  which is net of a purchase price adjustment of million and proceeds of million from the subsequent sale of a portion of the assets acquired  was financed by borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility 
conoco acquisition 
on december   we completed the purchase from conoco inc of natural gas and oil properties and associated gathering pipelines and equipment  together with developed and undeveloped acreage  located in the webb and zapata counties of south texas 
the million cash purchase price was financed by borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility 
the properties purchased cover approximately  gross  net acres located in the alexander  haynes  hubbard and south trevino fields  which are in close proximity to our existing operations in the charco field  and represent interests in approximately producing wells 
we operate approximately of the producing wells we acquired 
our average working interest is 
total proved reserves associated with the interests acquired were bcfe  as of the october   the effective date of the transaction 
other recent developments joint offshore exploration program 
effective september   we entered into a joint offshore exploration agreement with el paso production oil gas usa  lp  a subsidiary of el paso corporation 
under the terms of the agreement  el paso contributed approximately million for land  seismic and drilling costs in exchange for of our working interest in six specified prospects that we developed 
el paso pays of the drilling costs to casing point or of the dry hole costs  except for the high island prospect for which we have an obligation of million for dry hole costs 
el paso is the operator of four of the wells and we are operator of the remaining two 
under the terms of the agreement  el paso has the option to extend the exploration agreement beyond the initial six well program 
the option expires in august as of the date of this report  four wells in the program have been drilled 
two resulted in discoveries and have been successfully completed and placed on line 
one well has been completed and is currently testing and the fourth well has been temporarily abandoned and is being evaluated for further completion 
the fifth well in the program  high island  currently drilling to a target depth of  feet 
the sixth well in the program is currently planned for the second quarter of el paso will operate this well and if they elect not to drill the final well  all interests in the prospect will revert back to us 
severance tax refund 
during july  we applied for and received from the railroad commission of texas a high cost tight gas formation designation for a portion of our south texas production 
the high cost tight gas formation designation will allow us to receive an abatement of severance taxes for qualifying wells in various fields 
for qualifying wells  production will be either exempt from tax or taxed at a reduced rate until certain capital costs are recovered 
for qualifying wells  we will also be entitled to a refund of severance taxes paid during a designated prior month period 
applications for refund are submitted on a well by well basis to the state comptroller s office and due to timing of the acceptance of applications  we are unable to project the month look back period for qualifying refunds 
we currently estimate that the total refund  for and prior periods  will be between million to million million to million  net of tax  although we can provide no assurances that the actual total refund amount will fall within our current estimate 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded refunds totaling million million net of tax of which million relates to refund of severance tax expense and related to refunds of prior period expense

recent financial and operating results comparison of years ended december  and production 
our production increased from  million cubic feet equivalent  or mmcfe  for the year ended december  to  mmcfe for the year ended december  the increase in production was primarily attributable to production added from properties acquired in south texas since december  together with newly developed production generated from our subsequent development and workover programs initiated on these acquired properties during during  we successfully drilled and completed a total of new wells  consisting of onshore wells and offshore wells 
of the wells drilled onshore  were drilled in south texas  of which were drilled on our newly acquired acreage with the balance being drilled in our charco field 
onshore  our daily production rates increased from an average of mmcfe day during to an average of mmcfe day during properties acquired from conoco inc on december  accounted for mmcfe day of the increase for and properties acquired from burlington resources on may  accounted for mmcfe day of the increase for production from our charco field in south texas averaged mmcfe day during the current year and remained unchanged from rates 
production from all other onshore areas arkoma  east texas  west virginia and south louisiana decreased mmcfe day or approximately from an average of mmcfe day during to mmcfe day during primarily a result of a decrease in production in south louisiana due principally to natural reservoir decline 
offshore  our production decreased from an average of mmcfe day during to an average of mmcfe day during during january  we initiated production from our newly completed facilities at vermilion we added new facilities and a series of new wells throughout at east cameron  and during september and october we evacuated and shut in offshore platforms and facilities due to tropical storms faye and isidore and hurricane lili 
we estimate that we shut in approximately mmcfe or mmcfe day on an annualized basis 
in october  we acquired from keyspan incremental working interests in offshore wells that were initially developed under a joint exploration agreement with keyspan see note related party transactions keyspan joint venture from through overall  for the year  increments in production growth resulting from our acquisition and our new exploration and development projects was offset by natural production declines in existing properties 
natural gas and oil revenues 
natural gas and oil revenues decreased from million for year ended december  to million for the year ended as a result of a decrease in average realized natural gas prices  from per mcf during to per mcf in  offset in part by a increase in production for the same period 
natural gas prices 
as a result of hedging activities  we realized an average gas price of per mcf for the year ended  which was of the average unhedged natural gas price of that we otherwise would have received  resulting in natural gas and oil revenues for that were million higher than the revenues we would have achieved if hedges had not been in place during the year 
for the corresponding period during  we realized an average gas price of per mcf  which was of the average unhedged natural gas price of that otherwise would have been received  resulting in natural gas and oil revenues that were million higher than the revenues we would have achieved if hedges had not been in place during the period 
lease operating expense 
lease operating expenses increased from million in to million in on an mcfe basis  lease operating expenses increased from per mcfe during to per mcfe during the increase in both lease operating expenses and lease operating expenses per unit is attributable to the continued expansion of our operations onshore and offshore combined with an increase in expenses during onshore operations expanded with the acquisition of approximately new producing wells in south texas from the december  acquisition from conoco inc and the may  acquisition from burlington resources 
excluding the incremental expenses relating to newly acquired properties  the increase in our onshore lease operating expenses is due primarily to increased ad valorem taxes and increased compression expenses 
ad valorem taxes increased as a result of the high natural gas prices experienced in compression expenses increased during the second half of as we implemented a project in the charco field to boost production by adding compressors to streamline and lower gathering system pressure 
offshore  our lease operating expenses increased due to the addition of production facilities at vermilion and east cameron  new processing fees attributable to oil production at vermilion where we have chosen to have a third party process our oil rather than constructing our own oil facilities  the implementation of compression projects to enhance production capabilities at several of our existing facilities and finally  an increase in well control insurance premiums during the current year 
severance tax 
severance tax  which is a function of volume and revenues generated from onshore production  decreased from million during to million during on an mcfe basis  severance tax decreased from per mcfe during to per mcfe during the decrease in severance tax expense is primarily due to million recorded during the fourth quarter of related to refunds of expense incurred during the current year 
in july  we applied for and received from the railroad commission of texas a high cost tight gas formation designation for a portion of our south texas production see note commitments and contingencies severance tax refund 
in addition to the million recorded as a reduction to current year severance tax expense  we recorded as other non operating income million for refunds relating to prior periods 
excluding the effect for the million  severance tax would have been million and per mcfe during compared to million and per mcfe for expense is comparable because wellhead prices were lower during as compared to wellhead prices received during  however  our onshore production increased by during which accounts for the decrease in the adjusted severance tax on a per unit basis 
transportation expense 
we applied emerging issues task force eitf no 
accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs for all periods presented 
pursuant to our application of eitf no 
 transportation expenses previously reflected as a reduction of natural gas and oil revenues were added back to the related revenues and reclassified as a separate component of operating expense 
for the year ended december   natural gas and oil revenues  total revenues  transportation expense and total operating expenses were restated 
the application of eitf no 
had no effect on operating income or net income 
see note restatement and reclassification made to consolidated statements of operations for transportation expense 
transportation expense for increased from million and per mcfe during to million and per mcfe during the increase in expense is due primarily to the increase in our onshore production volume during as compared to depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased from million during to million for the year of depreciation  depletion and amortization expense per mcfe increased from during to during the increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was a result of higher production volumes combined with a higher depletion rate 
our depletion rate has increased during as we completed the evaluation of several properties that were classified as unproved at december  as evaluation is completed  the costs associated with these properties were reclassified into our amortization base 
the higher depletion rate is a result of a combination of adding costs to the full cost pool with fewer new reserves being added from exploration and developmental drilling together with an overall increase in our finding and development costs 
we believe that higher finding costs are being experienced across the industry  particularly for companies our size whose primary area of exploration is the outer continental shelf or the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico 
because the outer continental shelf is a mature producing area  it is becoming increasingly more difficult to find and develop new reserves at historical costs 
general and administrative expenses  net of capitalized general and administrative expenses and overhead reimbursements 
general and administrative expenses  net of overhead reimbursements received from other working interest owners of million and million during and  respectively  and capitalized general and administrative expenses directly related to oil and gas exploration and development activities of million and million  respectively  for and  decreased from million during to million during aggregate general and administrative expenses decreased from million during to million during included in aggregate and net administrative expenses during were payments totaling million made in connection with the termination of former executive officers employment contracts 
excluding the one time charges during for the termination of employment contracts  aggregate general and administrative expenses would have been million in compared to million for  an increase for the current year 
the increase in expenses for is due to the overall expansion of our business  our workforce and our office space 
payroll and employee benefits  rent and utilities and legal  accounting and consulting expenses have all increased during excluding the effect of the one time charges during  net general and administrative expenses reflects a corresponding increase of from million during to million during the increase in overhead reimbursements during is due to an increase in the number of producing properties that we operate that have third party working interests 
capitalized general and administrative expenses increased slightly by during as compared to as we capitalized approximately the same percentage of general and administrative expenses during both and on an mcfe basis  net general and administrative expenses decreased from per mcfe during to per mcfe during excluding the effect of the one time charges taken in year of for the termination of employment contracts totaling million  net general and administrative expenses on a per mcfe basis would have remained unchanged at approximately per mcfe for both and with an increase in expense offset by an increase in production 
other income and expense 
for the year ended  we recorded other income of million relating to refund of severance tax paid in prior periods and recorded pursuant to our receipt of a high cost tight sand designation for a portion of our south texas production see note commitments and contingencies severance tax refund 
during the year of  we incurred an additional million in expenses relating to a strategic review initiated in the fourth quarter of and completed in the first quarter of in september  together with keyspan  our majority stockholder  we had announced our intention to review strategic alternatives for our company and keyspan s investment in our company 
consideration was given to a full range of strategic transactions including the possible sale of all or a portion of our assets 
on february   we announced  together with keyspan  that the review of strategic alternatives for houston exploration had been completed 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest  increased from million during to million for aggregate interest expense increased by from during to million during the increase in aggregate interest is due to a decrease in interest rates from an average borrowing rate of during to an average borrowing rate of during offset by an increase in our average borrowings from million during to an average of million for capitalized interest decreased from million for to million for and corresponds to the decrease in aggregate interest expense combined with a decrease in exploratory drilling during our capitalized interest is a function of exploratory drilling and unevaluated properties  both of which were at lower levels during income tax provision 
the provision for income taxes decreased from million for to million for due to the decrease in pre tax income during from million during to million during as a result of the combination of a decrease in natural gas revenues and increases in both operating expenses and net interest expense 
operating income and net income 
operating income decreased from million during to million during as a result of a decrease in revenues caused by a decrease in realized natural gas prices offset only in part by the increase in production combined with a increase in operating expenses 
corresponding to the decrease in operating income  net income decreased from million during to million during and includes the effects of higher interest expense and lower taxes 
comparison of the years ended december  and production 
our production increased from  mmcfe for the year ended december  to  mmcfe for the year ended december  the increase in production was primarily attributable to newly developed offshore production brought on line since the end of the second quarter of offshore  our production increased from an average of mmcfe day during to an average of mmcfe day during this increase is primarily attributable to a full year of production at west cameron  north padre island  matagorda and high island combined with newly developed production at galveston island   and  high island and east cameron onshore  our daily production rates decreased slightly by from an average of mmcfe day during to an average of mmcfe day during the onshore production decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in production from our south louisiana properties from an average of mmcfe day during to an average of mmcfe day during due primarily to natural reservoir decline 
average daily production from our charco field together with production from our arkoma  east texas and west virginia properties remained unchanged at an average of mmcfe day and mmcfe day  respectively 
natural gas and oil revenues 
natural gas and oil revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result of a increase in average realized natural gas prices  from per mcf in to per mcf in  combined with a increase in production for the same period 
natural gas prices 
as a result of hedging activities  we realized an average gas price of per mcf for the year ended december   which was of the average unhedged natural gas price of that we otherwise would have been received  resulting in natural gas and oil revenues for the year ended december  that were million higher than the revenues we would have achieved if hedges had not been in place during the period 
for the corresponding period during  we realized an average gas price of per mcf  which was of the average unhedged natural gas price of that otherwise would have been received  resulting in natural gas and oil revenues that were million lower than the revenues we would have achieved if hedges had not been in place during the period 
lease operating expenses and severance tax 
lease operating expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  on an mcfe basis  lease operating expenses decreased from per mcfe during to per mcfe during the increase in lease operating expenses for is attributable to the continued expansion of our operations  primarily from the addition of four new offshore producing blocks during combined with a full year of operations from another four blocks brought on line during the second half of we saw service costs increase during the first half and stabilize during the later half of the year which corresponded directly with the weakening of commodity prices and a slowdown in drilling activity across the industry 
the decrease in lease operating expenses per mcfe reflects the increase in production volume during due primarily to newly developed offshore production 
severance tax  which is a function of volume and revenues generated from onshore production  increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  on an mcfe basis  severance tax remained unchanged at per mcfe for each of the years ended december  and the increase in severance tax expense reflects higher natural gas prices received during combined with newly developed offshore production located in state waters brought on line during the year 
transportation expense 
we applied emerging issues task force eitf no 
accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs for all periods presented 
pursuant to our application of eitf no 
 transportation expense previously reflected as a reduction of natural gas and oil revenues were added back to the related revenues and reclassified as a separate component of operating expense 
for the years ended december  and  natural gas and oil revenues  total revenues  transportation expense and total operating expenses were restated and reclassified  respectively 
the application of eitf no 
had no effect on operating income or net income 
see note restatement and reclassification made to consolidated statements of operations for transportation expense 
transportation expense increased from million and per mcfe in to million and per mcfe during the increase in expense corresponds to the increase in total production for depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense per mcfe increased from during to during the increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was a result of higher production volumes combined with a higher depletion rate 
the higher depletion rate is primarily a result of a higher level of capital spending during as compared to combined with the addition of fewer new reserves in from exploration and developmental drilling 
writedown in carrying value of natural gas and oil properties 
at december   we were required under full cost accounting rules to write down the carrying value of our full cost pool primarily as a result of weak natural gas prices 
in calculating the ceiling test  we estimated  using a december  wellhead price of per mcf  that our capitalized costs exceeded the ceiling limitation by million and accordingly we recorded a writedown of our full cost pool and a charge to earnings during the fourth quarter of million  net of tax 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  net of overhead reimbursements received from other working interest owners  of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  included in reimbursements received from working interest owners were reimbursements totaling million during received from keyspan pursuant to our joint drilling venture with keyspan see note related party transactions 
overhead reimbursements were terminated december  with the expiration of the initial exploratory term of our joint drilling venture with keyspan  and as a result we no longer receive reimbursement of general and administrative expenses from keyspan 
we capitalized general and administrative expenses directly related to oil and gas exploration and development activities of million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and the increase in capitalized general and administrative expenses is a result of higher aggregate general and administrative expenses during aggregate general and administrative expenses were higher during as a result of i one time payments totaling million in connection with the termination of former executive officers employment contracts  ii expansion of our workforce  and iii an increase in incentive compensation and benefit related expenses 
on an mcfe basis  general and administrative expenses increased from during to during excluding the one time charges taken for the termination of employment contracts totaling million  general and administrative expenses on a per mcfe basis would have increased from for to for the higher rate per mcfe during reflects the increase in aggregate general and administrative expenses caused by the effects of the termination of reimbursements received pursuant to our joint drilling venture with keyspan which totaled million during combined with the expansion of the company s workforce and higher incentive compensation and benefit related expenses 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest  decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  aggregate interest expense decreased from during to million during the decrease in aggregate interest is due to a decrease in interest rates combined with i the repayment of million in borrowings under the revolving bank credit facility during the first nine months of  and ii the march  conversion of million in outstanding borrowings under a revolving credit facility with keyspan into  shares of our common stock see note stockholders equity keyspan credit facility and conversion 
capitalized interest decreased from million during to million during and reflects the decrease in aggregate interest expense offset in part by a higher level of exploratory drilling during our capitalized interest is a function of exploratory drilling and unevaluated properties 
interest rates on our total outstanding borrowings averaged during compared to in income tax provision 
the provision for income taxes increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to the increase in pre tax income during from million during to million during as a result of the combination of higher natural gas prices  an increase in production  a decrease in interest expense offset in part by an increase in operating expenses 
operating income and net income 
for the year ended december   the increase in natural gas prices combined with the increase in production  offset in part by a increase in operating expenses  caused operating income to increase from million during to million during correspondingly  net income increased from million for to million for and reflects lower interest expense and higher taxes 
liquidity and capital resources we currently fund our operations  acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital requirements from cash flows from operations  public debt and bank borrowings 
we believe cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures and operating expenses during cash flows 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million and million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving bank credit facility 
the working capital deficit is due to the classification as a current liability of million relating to the current portion of the fair market value of our derivative instruments 
net cash provided by operating activities for was million compared to million during the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was due to i a decrease in net income caused primarily by lower realized natural gas prices  offset in part by an increase in production volumes during the current year combined with ii a net increase in current assets and current liabilities at year end which is related to the timing of cash receipts and payments 
for  the increase in current assets was caused primarily by an increase in receivables at the end of due to higher gas prices and production volumes for the fourth quarter of as compared to the corresponding period of current liabilities excluding the fair value of derivatives which is a non cash item increased due to a higher level of drilling activity in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of for the year of  funds used in investing activities consisted of million for net cash investments in property and equipment  which compares to million spent during our cash position increased during as a result of net borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility of million compared to repayments totaling million during cash increased by million and million  respectively  during and due to proceeds received from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options 
as a result of these activities  cash and cash equivalents increased million from million at december  to million at december  investments in property and equipment 
during the year of  we invested million in natural gas and oil properties and million for other property and equipment  which includes the expansion of our houston office space together with upgrades to our information technology systems and equipment

future capital requirements 
our capital expenditure budget for is million 
this amount includes an estimated million for exploration  million for development and facility construction and million for leasehold acquisition costs  which includes seismic  capitalized interest and general and administrative expenses 
we do not include property acquisition costs in our capital expenditure budget because the size and timing of capital requirements for acquisitions are inherently unpredictable 
the capital expenditure budget includes exploration and development costs associated with projects in progress or planned for the upcoming year and amounts are contingent upon drilling success 
no significant abandonment or dismantlement costs are anticipated in no assurances can be made that amounts budgeted will equal actual amounts spent 
we will continue to evaluate our capital spending plans throughout the year 
actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to a variety of factors  including drilling results  natural gas prices  industry conditions and outlook and future acquisitions of properties 
we believe cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund these expenditures 
we intend to continue to selectively seek acquisition opportunities for proved reserves with substantial exploration and development potential both offshore and onshore although we may not be able to identify and make acquisitions of proved reserves on terms we consider favorable

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk natural gas and oil hedging we utilize derivative commodity instruments to hedge future sales prices on a portion of our natural gas and oil production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce our exposure to adverse price fluctuations of natural gas 
our derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it also limits increases in future revenues as a result of favorable price movements 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties are unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
hedging instruments that we use are swaps  collars and options  which we generally place with major investment grade financial institutions that we believe are minimal credit risks 
historically  we have not experienced credit losses 
we believe that our credit risk related to our natural gas futures and swap contracts is no greater than the risk associated with the primary contracts and that the elimination of price risk reduces volatility in our reported results of operations  financial position and cash flows from period to period and lowers our overall business risk  however  as a result of our hedging activities we may be exposed to greater credit risk in the future 
during the fourth quarter of  an increase in forward market prices for natural gas caused our mark to market exposure with one counter party to surpass our contractual margin threshold as established under the contract 
as a result  we were required to post margin in the amount of million 
the margin payment earns interest at a market rate and will be refunded if our mark to market exposure drops below the margin threshold as required under the contract 
this will occur if market prices decline from current levels 
subsequent to december   our margin was increased by million to a balance of million as of the date of our report 
our hedges are cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
and  accordingly  we carry the fair market value of our derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and defer unrealized gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income 
gains and losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement as a component of natural gas and oil revenues in the period the hedged production occurs 
if any ineffectiveness occurs  amounts are recorded directly to other income or expense

for oil  our swaps are settled against the average nymex price of oil for the calendar month rather than the last day of the month 
in order to determine fair market value of our derivative instruments  we obtain mark to market quotes from external counterparties 
with respect to any particular swap transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price for the transaction  and we are required to make payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price for the transaction 
for any particular collar transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price for the transaction  and we are required to make payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling price for the transaction 
we are not required to make or receive any payment in connection with a collar transaction if the settlement price is between the floor and the ceiling 
for option contracts  we have the option  but not the obligation  to buy contracts at the strike price up to the day before the last trading day for that nymex contract
