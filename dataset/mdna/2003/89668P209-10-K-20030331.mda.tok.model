overview we offer local and long distance telephone services in combination with enhanced communication features accessible through the telephone or the internet 
these features include personal voice assistant pva  find me  notify me  caller identification  call waiting and speed calling 
our pva allows users to store contacts in a virtual address book and then access and utilize that information by voice from any telephone 
pva users can also send voice e mails 
we are an emerging provider of advanced  integrated telecommunications services targeted to residential and small business subscribers 
in addition to providing our services to consumers we are also providing these services on a wholesale basis 
our wholesale services provide other companies the ability to utilize our telephone exchange services  enhanced services platform  infrastructure and back office operations to provide services to consumers and small business customers 
for management purposes  we are organized into two reportable operating segments consumer services and wholesale services 
the nature of our business is rapidly evolving  and we have a limited operating history 
history of operations we were founded in january of in our first year of operations  we focused primarily on research and development activities  recruiting personnel  purchasing operating assets  and developing our service offerings and marketing plans 
in the fourth quarter of  we launched our first service offering composed of an access card to make long distance calls from any phone coupled with enhanced services  such as voice mail  find me  and community messaging 
in our revenues totaled million 
during june of we launched our primary service offering z line home edition currently called z linehome in new york 
this is our bundled telecommunications service providing integrated local  long distance and enhanced services targeted at residential customers 
our revenues for increased to million 
on december   we filed our initial public offering of million shares 
this offering resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
this offering provided us with the opportunity  at the potential expense of profitability  to accelerate our investments in the building of our network  continued research and development  sales and marketing  and professional services and general and administrative infrastructure 
we purchased touch communications  inc touch in april to accelerate our growth 
these investments lead to our revenues growing to million in nevertheless  these investments also significantly increased our operating and cash expenditures 
this growth was slowed during as we moved our focus from growth to profitability 
we focused on lowering customer acquisition costs  improving operating efficiencies  and attracting and maintaining a higher quality customer  which initiatives resulted in a charge of million relating to the write off of certain accounts receivables and a million impairment of assets relating to the sale of telemarketing centers 
we also experienced a reduction in overall headcount in through a workforce reduction  attrition and the sale of the majority of the operations and assets of the telemarketing centers that we acquired in in  we had revenues of million and incurred a net loss of million compared to a net loss of million in we continued our focus on operating improvement and cash management during we also decided to diversify our services and revenues streams by offering wholesale services to other telephone companies 
we signed a contract with mci worldcom communications  inc mci at the end of the first quarter of we recorded million of revenues and net loss of million during our wholesale services represented of total revenues 
we have recently begun to focus on increasing revenues again 
we believe the improvements that we have made over the last two years and our recent shift to focus on growth and innovation  including the recent launch of our pva will continue to result in the achievement of positive ebitda and positive cash flows for and possibly positive net income on a quarterly basis during the third or fourth quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  disputed payables related to network operations expense  valuation of accounts receivable  property  plant and equipment  long lived and intangible assets  restructuring reserves  tax related accruals and contingencies 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when earned 
revenues related to long distance and carrier access service charges are billed monthly in arrears and the associated revenues are recognized during the month of service 
subscription services are billed monthly in advance and we recognize revenues for this service ratably over the service period 
we defer certain installation charges and recognize this revenue ratably over the estimated life of our customer 
our wholesale services revenues are derived from contractual arrangements 
we perform a review of each contract and determine the appropriate timing of revenues recognition depending on the facts and circumstances of each individual item within the contract 
we are currently deferring certain revenues over the life of our arrangements  rather than recognizing revenues up front 
we use the gross method to record our revenues for wholesale services 
this method involves the recording of revenues for items that we are directly reimbursed by our wholesale customer with an offsetting expense reported in the appropriate operating expense line 
we operate in a heavily regulated industry  therefore  our pricing is subject to both state and federal regulatory commission oversight 
such oversight could result in changes to the amount we bill our customers in current and future periods 
disputed payables related to network operations expense 
network operations expenses are primarily charges from the incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs for the leasing of their lines  utilizing the unbundled network element platform pricing une p  made available to us as a result of the telecommunication act of  and long distance and other charges from inter exchange carriers ixc 
we have disputed billings with ixc and ilecs 
certain of these disputed amounts are not recorded as an expense at the time of dispute 
our disputes are for various reasons including but not limited to incorrect rates  alternatively billed services  duplicate billing  and line loss 
this pricing is subject to both state and federal oversight and therefore  our pricing is subject to change 
this change could have a material impact on our business model 
valuation of accounts receivable 
considerable judgment is required to assess the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of our customers 
we have utilized a consistent method  on a monthly basis  for calculating our bad debts since our change in the second quarter of we regularly analyze our approach as we gain additional experience or new events and information are identified to determine if any change to our calculation is required 
property  plant and equipment 
changes in technology or changes in the intended use of property  plant and equipment may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
we utilize straight line depreciation for property and equipment 
we perform an annual analysis to confirm the appropriateness of estimated economic useful lives for each category of current property  plant and equipment 
estimates and assumptions used in both setting depreciable lives and testing for recoverability require considerable judgment 
long lived and intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate long lived and intangible assets  through the use of discounted cash flow projections  for potential impairment indicators 
additionally  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions  and operational considerations 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
for fiscal years beginning in  the methodology for assessing potential impairments of intangible asset changed as a result of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our intangible assets continue to be amortized monthly  on a straight line basis 
restructuring reserves 
in april of  we approved and implemented a restructuring to enhance our future cash flows and operating earnings 
the restructuring included a reduction of force coupled with the closure of our north dakota call centers and our new york sales office 
in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  the restructuring costs were recognized as liabilities at the time management committed us to the plan 
management determined that these costs provided no future economic benefit to us 
the restructuring included termination benefits and lease abandonment costs 
in addition  we agreed to a settlement to exit the two leases for our call centers in north dakota as of july  all termination benefits and settlements to exit our leases in north dakota are paid as of december  we have recorded restructuring reserve equal to the future lease payments for our new york office as we will be making payments through august tax related accruals 
our estimates of deferred and current income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in footnote income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 
these reflect our assessment of actual current and future income taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
currently we have placed a valuation allowance on all deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is required if the weight of evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
actual income and sales taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in tax law or results from final review of our tax returns by taxing authorities 
we also are subject to various tax audits from various federal  state  and local jurisdictions and make estimates based on the available information and consultation with experts where necessary 
we believe our estimates are reasonable  however  they may change materially in the future due to new developments or changes 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  audits and other claims related to lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of provable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss accrual required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
we consult with legal counsel and other experts where necessary in connection with our assessment of any contingencies 
the required accrual for any such contingency may change materially in the future due to new developments or changes in each matter 
acquisition of touch communications  inc 
and subsidiaries we completed the acquisition of touch  on april  the purchase price of touch consisted of million shares of our common stock and million in cash 
touch provided us with employees in sales  provisioning  and customer service 
we used the purchase accounting method for our acquisition of touch therefore  our discussions of the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources do not include any discussions regarding touch prior to our acquisition of touch  which is treated as being closed for accounting purposes  on april  this treatment is in accordance with the adoption of the purchase method of accounting 
as a result of our purchase of touch  we recorded goodwill of million and intangible assets related to customer lists of million on april  during the second quarter of  we recorded a million impairment of assets relating to the goodwill acquired from touch see the impairment of assets discussion in the results of operations for further details 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following consolidated management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with results by segment

during  we received a million retroactive rate reduction for the unbundled network elements from verizon as a result of their settlement with the new york public service commission 
restructuring charge 
during  we closed two call centers in north dakota and our new york sales office 
we recorded million for termination benefits  lease abandonment and lease settlement costs 
asset impairment 
we recorded a and million of expenses related to impaired assets in and  respectively 
this expense was the result of management s decision to reduce telemarketing activity levels 
in  a majority of the operations and assets of telemarketing centers acquired from touch were either voluntarily closed or sold 
in addition to the goodwill impairment of million  we recorded a million charge associated with the impairment of assets  composed of million relating to unrealizable software and development projects  million of a worthless telemarketing property and equipment  and million of securities deemed to be worthless 
as a result of management s decision in the second quarter of to enhance future cash flow and operating earnings  we closed the remaining call centers in north dakota and recorded a million asset impairment 
mci bankruptcy 
we recorded million for possible exposure to carrier receivables as a result of mci s bankruptcy 
we reversed million of revenue and recorded million of additional bad debt expense 
wholesale development costs 
during  we began to provide wholesale telephone service 
we recorded start up costs for developing this new service offering of approximately million 
write down of accounts receivable 
included in the general and administrative expense was a write off of accounts receivable that resulted in million of additional bad debt expense 
revenues 
revenues decreased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the average z linehome and z linebusiness customer count of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the prior year 
additionally  the decrease in touch long distance lines in service contributed an additional decrease of million to our revenues 
the following table outlines the approximate number of subscriber lines for z linehome and touch long distance services as of the end of the period type of service december  december  z linehome and z linebusiness   touch long distance services   the reduction in lines in service was a result of our effort to slow growth for the first three quarters of  while eliminating poor paying customers and increasing the quality of our embedded subscriber base with respect to payment experience 
these decreases were off set by the introduction of our wholesale services which contributed million to our revenues for the nine months that we offered this service during the following table  in millions  provides a summary of our revenues for the years ended and type of revenues z linehome and z linebusiness touch long distance services wholesale services total our service offerings  z linehome and z linebusiness  accounted for of our total revenues in  compared to the prior year 
these offerings are currently available in states 
we expect z linehome to continue to increase as a percentage of consumer revenues and relative to our touch long distance services but decrease as an overall percentage of total revenues as we expect continued growth in our wholesale service business 
our z linehome and z linebusiness revenues were primarily derived from the following ten states shown in the below table for both years and the z linebusiness revenues are immaterial percentage of total z linehome and z linebusiness revenues california georgia illinois massachusetts maryland michigan new york pennsylvania texas virginia all others total network operations 
network operations expense decreased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
our consolidated gross margin percentage increased to for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
our network operations expense primarily consists of fixed and variable transmission expenses for interconnection agreements with ilecs  service level agreements with ixcs  and transmission services based on tariffed arrangements 
the decrease in network operation expenses was primarily the result of having an overall lower average number of subscribers in service for the year ended compared to the prior year 
in addition  in early  the new york public service commission the commission approved a settlement  which reduced the prices that we and other competitive local exchange carriers pay for unbundled network elements and expanded the availability of those elements 
specifically  rates for the elements comprising the unbundled network element platform were reduced by approximately to per month per subscriber  on average 
these rate decreases were effective march  in addition  the commission directed verizon to provide bill credits to us in the amount of million to implement retroactive rate decreases for unbundled local switching 
we have recorded this credit during and have received the entire credit as of december  from verizon 
in the future we do not anticipate any further retroactive rate reductions 
as a result of the federal communication commission s triennial review the individual state commissions will be reviewing and determining the availability and pricing of the une p 
we believe that the decision to allow each individual state to determine the rules related to une p will result in both increases and decreases in availability of une p and increases and decreases to pricing that will result in more or less competition 
we will be focusing our efforts on insuring the pricing and availability of une p is conducive to our desire to compete  however  we recognize the wide range of possibilities that could occur 
we will likely focus our efforts to increase lines toward states that provide pricing that we determine is appropriate for our growth model and expect an overall increase in network operations expenses in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
the sales and marketing expense primarily consists of telemarketing  direct mail  brand awareness advertising  and independent sales representative commissions and salaries and benefits paid to employees engaged in sales and marketing activities 
our continued decrease in sales and marketing expense was a result of our focus to conserve cash while focusing on improving internal operations and subscriber quality 
this focus and decrease in marketing activity contributed to a decrease in lines of  or about during our primary source of sales for was from independent sales representatives 
it was not until the last quarter of that we changed our focus to line growth and began a multi faceted marketing campaign in atlanta  georgia that combined radio  billboard  and television advertising to launch our new service offering  pva 
in addition to our marketing campaign we also contracted with several independent sales representatives during the latter half of that contributed to our fourth quarter line growth 
we expect to continue to focus our sales and marketing efforts to maintain acceptable acquisition costs per subscriber 
we expect to increase our advertising levels  grow our independent sales representatives sales force  and increase our partnering opportunities throughout we will continue to build our overall awareness of the z brand  and explore alliances and ventures with other companies 
we expect sales and marketing expense to increase during  over that experienced during  as we use our expected increase in cash flow from our consumer and wholesale business to fund sales and marketing efforts in additional metropolitan areas 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
general and administrative expense primarily consists of employee salaries and benefits  temporary services  bad debt expense  billing and collection costs  occupancy costs  and provisioning costs 
the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily related to the write off of accounts receivables in that resulted in million of additional bad debt expense 
excluding the million of bad debt expense  general and administrative expense decreased only million during and represented of revenues in compared to in this increase as a percentage of revenues was largely the result of our decision in to continue our focus on internal operations  product offerings and subscriber economics rather than investing in line growth for most of the year 
excluding the write off from general and administrative expense  our decreased line count and focus on internal operations resulted in lower bad debt expense  decreased billing and collection expenses and less salaries and benefit expenses  all of which contributed to our reduced general and administrative expenses in compared to we believe we are appropriately positioned for the line and revenue growth that we are expecting during we anticipate general and administrative expenditures will continue to increase in the future to support our expanding service offerings and our expected increase in consumer and wholesale lines during we will continue to evaluate our operations for efficiencies and our employee staffing requirements as they relate to increased efficiencies or needs to expand or outsource services 
we expect to begin to see reductions of general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in this reduction is necessary for our achievement of profitability and the generation of positive cash flow for asset impairment charge 
asset impairment charges decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
the decrease in asset impairment is the result of our closure of the remaining north dakota call centers in after closing substantially all of the centers in as a result of management s decision in the second quarter of to enhance future cash flow and operating earnings  we decided to close the remaining call centers in north dakota acquired in our acquisition of touch in april of  we announced a restructuring plan that included a reduction in force and the closure of the north dakota call centers resulting in an asset impairment charge totaling million for property  plant  and equipment sold in conjunction with the settlement of the leases in these locations  in the second quarter of wholesale development costs 
wholesale development costs were million in we incurred these costs  related to the initiation of our wholesale services offerings  during the first quarter of restructuring charge 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in in april of  we approved and implemented a restructuring to enhance our future cash flows and operating earnings 
the restructuring included a reduction of force coupled with the closure of our north dakota call centers and our new york sales office 
in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  the restructuring costs were recognized as liabilities at the time management committed us to the plan 
management determined that these costs provided no future economic benefit to us 
the restructuring charge includes termination benefits and lease abandonment costs 
in addition  we agreed to a settlement to exit the two leases for our call centers in north dakota as of july  all termination benefits and settlements to exit our leases in north dakota were paid as of december  we have recorded a lease abandonment charge representing the future lease payments for our new york office as a liability and will make payments through august as of december  we had an accrual of approximately million remaining for this restructuring charge 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
the slight increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily a result of increased capital expenditures during the last couple of years 
we anticipate a flat to slightly increased depreciation and amortization expense during depending on our requirements to purchase additional computer equipment  switching equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements as a result of our line growth or the introduction of new services 
interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
interest and other income consists of interest charged to our z linehome customers for not paying their bills on time and income from interest earned from our cash balance and any gains from the sale of investments or securities 
the decrease for was primarily due to our having an overall average of fewer customers in service in compared to and exercising more effective treatment of poor paying customers resulting in fewer delinquencies and more timely payments by customers 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
our interest expense is a result of late fees for vendor payments  charges related to our rfc capital corporation rfc accounts receivable agreement  capital leases and our debt obligations 
the overall increase in interest expense is a result of million of increased late payment fees paid for network costs in compared to this increase was offset by reduced interest expense on our debt obligations 
the charges for the utilization of our accounts receivable arrangement with rfc during remained consistent with the prior year expenses  although we have decreased our sales of receivables during the second half of we anticipate that interest expense will decrease in the future as we continue to reduce our debt obligations and improve our cash flow  which should result in more timely payment of our network and other expenses 
this decrease will be offset to the extent that we are able to borrow money to support growth through new funding sources and to finance any significant capital expenditures necessary to grow our business in we expect the continued utilization of our rfc accounts receivable agreement during income tax benefit 
no provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded due to the full valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset for the years ended december  and net loss 
our net loss improved million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
excluding special items  as outlined in the table at the beginning of this section labeled special items reconciliation  net loss improved million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
net loss attributable to common stockholders 
our net loss attributable to common stockholders improved million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
excluding special items  net loss attributable to common stockholders improved million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
this decrease was primarily discussed above  however  there was also a decrease of million for the deemed dividend related to beneficial conversion in during  we recorded a deemed dividend of million  which resulted from the value assigned to the warrants and a beneficial conversion feature associated with the series g preferred transaction 
this deemed dividend was originally accreted over an expected life through december  the earliest redemption date 
once shareholder approval was obtained on october   the remaining balance of million began to be accreted over the remaining year redemption period that started at the date of grant 
ebitda 
many securities analysts use the measure of earnings before deducting interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  also commonly referred to as ebitda  as a way of evaluating our financial performance 
ebitda is not a measure under gaap  is not meant to be a replacement for gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
we have included ebitda data because it is a measure commonly used in the telecommunications industry and is presented to assist in understanding our operating results 
our ebitda improved by million to positive million for the year ended december   compared to negative million the prior year 
excluding special items  ebitda improved by million to positive million in  compared to negative million the prior year 
we expect to improve our positive ebitda during the expected generation of positive ebitda will primarily be attributed to increases in subscribers  operating efficiencies  and the contribution of existing and new wholesale services and other new services 
results of operations by segment management evaluates the performance of each business unit based segment results  exclusive of adjustments for special items 
special items are transactions or events that are included in our reported consolidated results but are excluded from segment results due to their nonrecurring or non operational nature 
we have broken these special items out in a table labeled special items reconciliation at the beginning of this section of the k 
in addition  when changes in our business affect the comparability of current versus historical results  we will adjust historical operating information to reflect the current business structure 
the following tables  in millions  provide our reportable segments in total dollars and as a percentage of our consolidated results 
these tables will facilitate our discussion of our results by segment 
it is important to understand that we only record direct expenses in our wholesale services and therefore  all employee benefits  occupancy  insurance  and other indirect or overhead related expenses are reflected in the consumer services segment 
we are in the process of reviewing and possibly adopting a methodology for internal reporting purposes that would allocate these indirect and overhead related expenses to the respective units or possibly separating these expenses from the segments

consumer services segment the following table  in millions  provides our consumer services segment for compared to this is the first annual discussion of our results by segment because prior to we had only one segment  consumer services

consumer services segment for the years ended amount percentage december  change change percentage of revenues favorable favorable unfavorable unfavorable revenues operating expenses network operations sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses segment results revenues 
revenues decreased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in z linehome customers in compared to the decrease in touch long distance lines in service contributed an additional decrease of million to our revenues 
these decreases were a result of focusing our efforts on establishing and growing our wholesale services  which were launched during  which partially reduced our focus from our consumer services business 
therefore  consumer services revenues decreased as a percentage of consolidated revenues by to for  compared to the prior year 
we changed our focus to increasing our line growth for our consumer services in the final quarter of and expect to see increased revenues during we expect consumer services revenues to grow at a slower rate than our wholesale services revenues  resulting in consumer services being a smaller percentage of consolidated revenues during compared to network operations 
network operations expense decreased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
our gross margin percentage increased to for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
excluded from this improved gross margin for is a million retroactive reduction to network access rates in new york  including this item  network operations expense would have decreased by million from and gross margin  as a percentage of consumer services revenues would have been for our network operations expense as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily as a result of decreases in the unbundled network element platform rates we pay to lease lines from the ilecs in the states we are operating and more specifically the rate reduction in new york  our largest market with of our z linehome and z linebusiness revenues 
other reductions resulted from improvements we have made to internal operations and processes that minimize our network operations costs 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
we continued to conserve cash during resulting in less than historically reported sales and marketing expense 
however  we have already increased our advertising activity and independent sales representatives programs during we intend to expand our marketing activity in order to add additional metropolitan areas during  in an attempt to increase our consumer lines in service 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
as a percentage of revenues general and administrative expense increased by to of revenues in compared to the prior year 
this increase excluded special items in of million of bad debt expense related to the worldcom bankruptcy and the accounts receivable write down totaling million of bad debt expense 
including these special items  general and administrative expense decreased by million during and was of revenues compared to for the prior year 
the increase as a percentage of revenues before special items was the result of our decision in to focus on internal operations  product offerings and future subscriber economics rather than investing in line growth for most of with the change of focus to line growth  we expect general and administrative expense to decrease as a percentage of revenues as a result of the leveraging of certain elements of our fixed cost structure  although we expect an increase in total dollars as we incur more charges for incremental costs such as  billing  collection  and headcount related expenses during during consumer services was of consolidated segment general and administrative expense 
included in the consumer services general and administrative expense is all employee benefits  occupancy  insurance  and other indirect or overhead related expenses as only direct costs are recorded in our wholesale services segment 
we are in the process of reviewing and possibly adopting a methodology for internal reporting purposes that would allocate these indirect and overhead related expenses to the respective segments or possibly separating these expenses from each segment 
we expect that our consumer services business will grow at a slower rate than our wholesale services during  therefore  we expect consumer services to be a smaller percentage of consolidated general and administrative expense during depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
the slight decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily a result of a small decrease in purchasing of capital assets during the last two years 
we anticipate depreciation to be relatively flat during  although we are contemplating various options for new services and innovations to our current services that may require the purchasing of additional hardware and software 
wholesale services segment this is the first annual discussion of our results by segment because prior to april  we had only one segment  consumer services 
therefore  the wholesale services segment has no results 
the following table  in millions  provides our wholesale services segment for compared to to facilitate our discussion of results for our wholesale services segment wholesale services segment for the years ended amount percentage december  change change percentage of revenues favorable favorable unfavorable unfavorable revenues operating expenses network operations general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses segment results revenues 
revenues were million or of consolidated segment revenues for these revenues are primarily from our wholesale contract with mci 
we have recently signed an agreement with sprint to provide wholesale services 
we expect the mci revenues to decrease considerably during and are already seeing a migration of customers from our systems 
we recognize the possibility of contract termination  however  we expect that sprint could make up for any shortfall in revenues should mci terminate their contract 
in addition  our business development group is actively pursuing other potential wholesale partners and working to develop new wholesale services 
we expect wholesale services to become a larger percentage of overall revenues during network operations 
network operations expense was million or of consolidated segment network operations expense 
we expect this expense to vary depending on each individual wholesale contract 
we incur these expenses when providing unbundled network elements that we lease from the ilec to our wholesale customers 
certain wholesale customers may not utilize this service or may only use this service for a short period of time under the contract 
therefore  it is difficult to anticipate the change to this expense during general and administrative 
general and administrative expense was million or of consolidated segment general and administrative expense 
the significant components of this expense mirror our consolidated expenses  however  we only record the direct expenses associated with our wholesale services 
therefore  we have not allocated any indirect or overhead expenses such as employee benefits  occupancy  insurance or other similar expenses to the wholesale services segment 
these expenses are all included in the consumer services segment 
we expect general and administrative expense to increase in total dollars and as a percentage of our consolidated expenses 
we also expect that we will begin to outsource certain functions  currently handled internally  to mange the anticipated growth of our wholesale services  while limiting our cost exposure 
we have been receiving pre prepayments from mci for our wholesale services as a result of their bankruptcy filing and have not recorded any bad debt for wholesale services 
we will continue to monitor our wholesale services and determine the appropriate bad debt methodology for our wholesale services based on each individual wholesale contract and partner 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million or of consolidated depreciation and amortization 
although we do not expect significant increases in our capital expenditures during we may have an increase in capital expenditures for our wholesale services compared to consumer services  which would lead to an increase percentage of our consolidated depreciation expense being attributable to wholesale services 
we are also contemplating new wholesale service offerings that may require additional capital expenditures that would also contribute to higher depreciation and amortization expense 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
the increase is attributable to the average z linehome customer count of  for the year ended december   compared to  the prior year 
touch contributed million of revenues for the year ended december  compared to million the prior year 
the following table outlines the approximate number of subscriber lines for z linehome and touch long distance services as of the end of the period type of service december  december  z linehome   touch long distance services   the reduction in lines during was a result of our effort to slow growth while eliminating poor paying customers and increasing the overall quality of our embedded subscriber base from a payment perspective 
our primary service offering  z linehome  which accounted for of our total revenues in compared to the prior year 
our z linehome product was available in states in  however  revenues were primarily derived from the following ten states shown in the below table percentage of total z line home revenues california georgia illinois massachusetts maryland michigan new york pennsylvania texas virginia all others total network operations 
network operations expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
our consolidated gross margin percentage increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
our focus on lower acquisition cost coupled with our changing customer acceptance policies and reduced growth objectives during resulted in a decrease of million of sales and marketing expense 
the remaining decrease in sales and marketing expense is primarily attributable to the sale and closure of substantially all of our telemarketing centers in minot  north dakota and canada as of june  this decrease in marketing has contributed to the overall decrease of  lines during general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
the increase in general and administrative expense primarily relates to the write off of accounts receivable that resulted in million of additional bad debt expense recorded during the second quarter of excluding the million of bad debt expense  general and administrative expense was of revenues compared to for the year ended december  this reduction as a percentage of revenues is the result of various cost control measures implemented during  to support our focus on improved subscriber quality rather than growth  as well as an increased utilization of fixed costs within our business 
asset impairment charge 
we recorded a million expense related to impaired assets in the second quarter of as a result of management s decision in the second quarter to reduce telemarketing efforts  a majority of the operations and assets of telemarketing centers acquired from touch were either voluntarily closed or sold 
on june  the telemarketing centers sold accounted for approximately million in property  plant and equipment 
for these assets  we received  shares of preferred stock of the privately held acquirer and a note receivable of approximately million 
the loss recorded on this transaction equated to approximately million 
as a result of the decision to reduce telemarketing efforts noted above and the subsequent transactions  management performed an assessment of the value of the intangible assets recorded in the touch acquisition  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in the second quarter  it was determined that undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining amortization period of certain intangible assets indicated that the value assigned to the intangible assets might not be recoverable 
therefore  we undertook an effort to determine the amount of expense to be recorded relating to the impairment 
the carrying value of the goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recorded on our books approximated million prior to the impairment analysis 
we calculated the fair value of goodwill by performing a discounted cash flow analysis related to the remaining assets acquired in the touch purchase 
as we determined that we would effectively cease any telemarketing efforts in the future  the sole remaining assets from the touch purchase were certain amounts of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets consisting of customer lists and goodwill acquired in the touch transaction 
assuming an attrition rate of and a discount rate of  it was determined that the remaining operations acquired from touch have a liquidation value which approximates the identifiable intangible assets associated with the carrying value of the customer lists acquired from touch at june   the carrying value of the identifiable intangible assets associated with the customer lists was approximately million 
therefore  we recorded a loss of million  the difference between the carrying value of all intangibles and the carrying value of the customer lists 
we recorded an additional million charge associated with the impairment of assets  composed of million relating to unrealizable software and development projects  million of a worthless telemarketing property and equipment  and million of securities deemed to be worthless 
we had million of intangible assets relating to customer lists recorded as of december  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
the increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily a result of having more fixed assets in service during interest and other income 
interest and other income increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
interest and other income consists of interest charged to our z linehome customers for not paying their bills on time and income from interest earned from our cash balance and any gains from the sale of investments or securities 
the increase for was primarily due to an overall average of more customers in service in compared to resulting in larger late payment fees being assessed to customers 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
our interest expense is a result of the interest charged related to our rfc accounts receivable agreement  capital leases and other debt obligations 
the increased interest expense relates to the utilization of our accounts receivable arrangement with rfc capital  corporation during income tax expense 
no provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded due to the full valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset for the years ended december  and net loss 
our net loss increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
this increase was due primarily to the increases in expenses described above 
net loss attributable to common stockholders 
our net loss attributable to common stockholders increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
this increase was due primarily to the increases in expenses described above and the issuance of the series d  e and g preferred shares 
in conjunction with the series d  e and g preferred  we incurred an aggregate of million of non cash charges relating to preferred stock dividends and accretion and an aggregate of million of a deemed dividend relating to a beneficial conversion feature 
this compared to million of preferred stock dividends and accretion and million of a deemed dividend for the year ended december in november  the emerging issues task force application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments required that all beneficial conversions be calculated using the accounting conversion price method 
the company recorded a million cumulative catch up adjustment  included in the million beneficial conversion feature  as a result of the securities and exchange commission requiring retroactive application of this method 
during  we recorded a deemed dividend of million  which resulted from the value assigned to the warrants and a beneficial conversion feature associated with the series g preferred transaction 
this deemed dividend was originally accreted over an expected life through december  the earliest redemption date 
once shareholder approval was obtained on october   the remaining balance of million began to be accreted over the remaining year redemption period that started at the date of grant 
as a result of the series g preferred transaction certain anti dilution clauses in the series d preferred stock agreement triggered an additional deemed dividend relating to a beneficial conversion feature that was accreted immediately in the amount of million 
ebitda 
many securities analysts use the measure of earnings before deducting interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  also commonly referred to as ebitda  as a way of evaluating our financial performance 
ebitda is not a measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  is not meant to be a replacement for gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
we have included ebitda data because it is a measure commonly used in the telecommunications industry and is presented to assist in understanding our operating results 
our negative ebitda increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources the competitive local telecommunications service business is traditionally considered to be a capital intensive business owing to the significant investments required in fiber optic communication networks and the colocation of switching and transmission equipment in incumbent local exchange carriers central offices 
although we will continue to make capital expenditures  we do not expect that the growth of our business will require the levels of capital investment in fiber optics and switches that existed in historical telecommunications facilities based models 
instead  we will devote significant amounts of our capital resources to continued operations  software development  new service offerings and marketing efforts that we have designed to achieve penetration of our target markets 
we have incurred accumulated losses since our inception as a result of developing our business  research and development  building and maintaining network infrastructure and technology  sales and promotion of our services  and administrative expenditures 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  a net tax operating loss carryforward of million  and million in cash and cash equivalents 
we have funded our expenditures primarily through operating revenues  private securities offerings  a sale leaseback credit facility  sales of accounts receivable and an initial public offering that raised net proceeds of million 
we intend to continue building our organization in anticipation of future growth and believe that our operating expenditures will also continue to increase 
net cash provided by operating activities improved by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million used in the prior year 
the improvement resulted from our overall improvement to net loss after eliminating non cash items 
we also benefited from prepayment of service revenues resulting in a large increase to deferred revenues as a result of our wholesale services agreement with mci  however  this increase more than off set the change in other operating assets and liabilities 
included in our net cash operating activities was the sale of and million of receivables  for net proceeds of and million  as of december  and  respectively 
a net receivable servicing asset of and million is included in accounts receivable and and million of advances on unbilled receivables are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of december  and  respectively

prior to march rfc purchased our receivables at a discount rate 
our collection percentages during and were and  respectively 
under the agreement we are responsible for the continued servicing of the receivables and any amount collected over the discount rate is paid to us by rfc for providing the servicing less certain fees 
we have reduced the amount of receivables available for sale during the last quarter of our net cash used in investing activities was million for both years ended december  and we purchased slightly less property and equipment totaling million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
this decrease was off set by the net change in related party payments and issuances of notes receivable 
we expect to maintain similar levels of purchases of property and equipment  but will invest additional resources if additional cash is available as a result of our improved operating activities 
we are also working to collect our related party notes and do not expect to be issuing any similar notes during our net financing activities decreased by million to million used in financing activities for the year ended december  compared to million provided by financing activities in the prior year 
this decrease is primarily a result of receiving million of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock in  and not having any similar stock issuance in this decrease was off set by million reduction of payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations totaling million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
we expect to maintain a low amount of long term debt although if appropriate terms became available to obtain a more traditional loan we would likely replace our existing accounts receivable agreement 
our existing debt is primarily related party  with fixed interest that is payable in monthly installments 
during  several of our management issued full recourse promissory notes  totaling approximately million to us in connection with the purchase of  shares of common stock 
these notes were collateralized by the shares of common stock acquired with the notes  and we hold those shares as collateral

neither the bankruptcy code nor the applicable case law requires vendors to provide post petition goods and services to a debtor without payment 
although mci has paid us in a timely manner since its bankruptcy filing  we have no assurance that mci has the resources to continue to pay its vendors on a timely basis 
for mci s customers provisioned using our company code  we are the customer of record for the regional bell operating companies wholesale billing

customers must be notified not less than days prior to discontinuance of service  and a second notice must be provided if the customer has not taken action to change to a new provider 
other states in which mci and we operate are developing similar rules for carriers exiting markets  generally using the commission s guidelines as a framework 
on august   we filed a complaint against southwestern bell telephone company swbt before the public utility commission of texas puct  requesting that the puct enjoin swbt from disconnecting our access to customers in texas on the basis of a billing dispute between the parties 
the billing dispute centered on whether we owed swbt certain amounts for collect calls from swbt retail customers to our retail customers 
on august   the puct issued  in part  the injunctive relief requested by us  making clear that service not be interrupted 
since that injunction  we and swbt have been involved in a dispute resolution process over these and other billing disputes between swbt and sbc affiliates of swbt 
there is no assurance that these and other disputes with swbt and other sbc affiliates will be resolved without resort to further litigation and potential disruption to service 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that the outcome of this litigation will be between and million 
we currently have agreements with two long distance carriers to provide transmission and termination services for all of our long distance traffic 
these agreements generally provide for the resale of long distance services on a per minute basis and contain minimum volume commitments 
although we have not fulfilled all of our volume commitments as outlined in one of these contracts for technical reasons  the carrier has not imposed any penalties as provided under the agreement 
we are continuing to work with this carrier and believe that we are quickly ramping to meet the minimum volume commitments during and do not expect any financial penalty to be applied by the carrier during the course of the agreement

this agreement is success based and non exclusive in nature 
in march  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to one million shares of our common stock over the next twelve months 
we have not yet purchased any stock under this plan 
our short term liquidity relies heavily upon our accounts receivable agreement  cash provided from operations  cash management strategies  and if needed  our ability to reduce certain discretionary capital and marketing expenses costs and growth of our consumer and wholesale services 
we have historically had negative cash flows and although we achieved positive ebitda for  and our net cash decreased by only million in compared to in the prior year  and we expect that trend to improve to the achievement of positive cash flows during  we are also aware of the risks  discussed throughout this document  of not achieving our goals and the impact thereof on our liquidity 
our ongoing capital requirements will depend on several factors  including market acceptance of our services  the amount of resources we devote to investments in our networks  facilities  build out of additional enterprise management centers  services development and brand promotions  the resources we devote to sales and marketing of our services  and other factors 
we will continue to provide our back office services and the technology we have developed to other companies seeking the capability of offering residential and small business telecommunication services 
as growth and opportunities arise  we expect to make strategic investments in technology and our network architecture and enter potential strategic alliances or partnerships with other entities 
we will make investments in sales and marketing to build our overall z brand  build strategic partnerships  and develop new service offerings in an attempt to attract new customers

we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this document 
risks related to our financial condition and our business limited operating history 
we were formed in january and began offering telecommunications services to the public in september moreover  we launched our principal service z linehome in june and initiated wholesale operations in january we have had fewer than five years of actual marketing  sales and operational results 
our limited operating history and results make it very difficult to evaluate or predict our ability to  among other things  retain customers  generate and sustain a revenue base sufficient to cover our operating expenses  and to achieve profitability 
as a result  we believe that our historical financial information is of little or no value in projecting our future results  making it even more difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 
uncertain demand 
we began marketing our products and services in september in june  we focused our product offering on sales of our z linehome service 
our z linebusiness service and wholesale initiative are only recently established 
our products and services represent an emerging sector of the telecommunications industry  and the demand for our services and our ability to retain customers over time are highly uncertain 
user acceptance of our products and services could be limited by the willingness of customers to accept z tel as an alternative provider of local and long distance telephone services and of other enhanced  integrated services  the presence and attractiveness of other enhanced telecommunications service offerings in our target markets  the perception of complexity in using our services  the reliability of our technology and network infrastructure  the quality of our billing  provisioning and customer service  and the prices of our services 
we have determined that substantial marketing effort  time and expense are required to stimulate initial demand for our retail products and services 
in addition  we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial operating expenses  have made  and will continue to make  significant capital investments and have entered or plan to enter into real property leases  equipment supply contracts and service arrangements  in each case based upon our expectations as to the market acceptance of our products and services 
we cannot be certain that substantial markets will develop for our products and services  or  if such markets develop  that we will be able to attract and maintain a sufficient revenue generating customer base to cover our operating expenses 
lack of acceptance of our services in our target markets would materially and adversely affect the commercial viability of our business  and as a consequence  the value of your investment 
in addition  to maintain our competitive posture  we must be in a position to reduce the prices for our services in order to meet reductions in local and long distance rates  if any  offered by others 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to match the reductions made by our competitors and  if we do  such reductions could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
possibility of future losses 
our product and service offerings are at an early stage  and we cannot be sure that sales of our products or services will generate revenues sufficient to cover our operating expenses 
therefore our operations may not become profitable within the time frame we expect or at all 
starting up our company and developing our communications technology required substantial capital and other expenditures and further development of our business will require significant additional expenditures 
availability and favorable pricing of unbundled network components 
our business strategy depends on a continued availability of unbundled network components and on existing and additional states maintaining and adopting favorable pricing rules for unbundled network components 
the public utilities commissions of certain states have adopted pricing rules for unbundled network components 
as a result of these regulatory initiatives  the bell operating companies operating in those states are required to offer to competitive local exchange carriers such as us  at forward looking  long run incremental cost based prices  the facilities and equipment and the features  functions and capabilities of their local exchange network on an unbundled basis 
we have commenced operations in states using unbundled network components 
however  given that the fcc order permitting unbundled network components is subject to further appeal  we cannot be certain that unbundled network components will continue to be available in their present form in those states or other states or that such other states will ever adopt favorable unbundled network components pricing 
further  regulatory changes may adversely affect unbundled network components of our z linehome or z linebusiness or adversely affect our wholesale initiatives 
our business model is based  in part  on availability and favorable pricing of the unbundled network components  and any adverse changes in the unbundled network elements platform regulatory or competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainties relating to wholesale initiative 
our wholesale initiative is newly developed 
there is no assurance that it will contribute to gross profit or otherwise be successful 
we believe we are the first competitive local exchange carrier to offer wholesale local exchange services 
we undoubtedly will encounter unforeseen delays  capital expenditures and upfront costs  regulatory and legal issues which may include legal challenges to our wholesale strategy by incumbent local exchange carriers  technical difficulties and other challenges 
there can be no assurance that we will overcome these challenges successfully or without expenditure of substantial resources 
moreover  since we must pay the incumbent local exchange carrier fees relating to local telephone usage by both our retail and wholesale customers  we will be highly dependent upon our wholesale customers 
their failure to pay fees to us may make it difficult or impossible for us to pay fees to the incumbent local exchange carriers upon which we rely 
rapid expansion 
we expect to grow our business rapidly in terms of the number of services we offer  the number of customers we serve and the regions we serve 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully manage our efforts to expand  train  manage and retain our employee base  expand and improve our customer service and support systems and improve the performance of billing systems  introduce and market new products and services and new pricing plans in addition to z linehome and our other service offerings  enhance and upgrade the features of our software  capitalize on new opportunities in the competitive marketplace  and control our expenses 
the strains posed by these demands are magnified by the emerging nature of our operations 
if we cannot manage our growth effectively  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
difficulties in expanding network infrastructure 
we must continue to develop  expand and adapt our network infrastructure as the number of our users and the amount of information they wish to access and transfer increases and as our customers demands change 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to develop  expand or adapt the network infrastructure to meet additional demand or our customers changing requirements on a timely basis  at a commercially reasonable cost  or at all 
if we fail to expand our network infrastructure on a timely basis or adapt it to either changing customer requirements or evolving industry standards  these failures could cause our business to perform poorly 
ability to resell long distance services 
we offer long distance telephone services as part of our service packages 
we currently have agreements with various long distance carriers to provide transmission and termination services for all of our long distance traffic 
recently  several long distance carriers have encountered financial difficulties  including at least one carrier utilized by us 
financial difficulties encountered by any of our carriers could cause disruption of service to our customers and could diminish the value of any receivables or credits that may be due to us from such carriers 
our agreements with long distance carriers generally provide for the resale of long distance services on a per minute basis and contain minimum volume commitments 
in cases in which we have agreed to minimum volume commitments and fail to meet them  we will be obligated to pay underutilization charges 
in some instances  if we incur underutilization charges  our basic rate will increase  which could further adversely affect our operating results 
to date  we have not paid any material underutilization charges 
risk of software failures and errors 
the software that we use and the software that we have developed internally and are continuing to develop may contain undetected errors 
although we have extensively tested our software  errors may be discovered in the software during the course of its use 
any errors may result in partial or total failure of our network  loss or diminution in service delivery performance  additional and unexpected expenses to fund further product development or to add programming personnel to complete or correct development  and loss of revenue because of the inability of customers to use our products or services  which could adversely affect our business condition 
protection of proprietary technology 
we currently rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual confidentiality provisions to protect the proprietary information that we have developed 
our ability to protect our proprietary technology is limited  and we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
also  we cannot be certain that the intellectual property that incumbent local exchange carriers or others claim to hold and that may be necessary for us to provide our services will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
if we were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  we might be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which may be costly or not available on commercially reasonable terms 
if successful  a claim of infringement against us and our inability to license the infringed or similar technology on terms acceptable to us could adversely affect our business 
dependence on information systems 
our billing  customer service and management information systems are newly developed and we may face unexpected system difficulties  which would adversely affect our service levels and  consequently  our business 
sophisticated information and processing systems are vital to our ability to monitor costs  render monthly invoices for services  process customer orders and achieve operating efficiencies 
we rely on internal systems and third party vendors  some of which have a limited operating history  to provide our information and processing systems 
if our systems fail to perform in a timely and effective manner and at acceptable costs  or if we fail to adequately identify all of our information and processing needs or if our related processing or information systems fail  these failures could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our right to use third party systems is dependent upon license agreements 
some of these agreements are cancelable by the vendor  and the cancellation or nonrenewal of these agreements could seriously impair our ability to process orders or bill our customers 
as we continue to provide local telephone service  the need for sophisticated billing and information systems will also increase significantly and we will have significant additional requirements for data interface with incumbent local exchange carriers and others 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to meet these additional requirements 
network failure 
the successful operation of our network will depend on a continuous supply of electricity at multiple points 
although the system that carries signals has been designed to operate under extreme weather conditions including heavy rain  wind and snow  like all other telecommunications systems  our network could be adversely affected by such conditions 
our network  however  is equipped with a back up power supply and our existing network operations center is equipped with both a battery backup and an on site emergency generator 
if a power failure causes an interruption in our service  the interruption could negatively impact our operations 
our network also may be subject to physical damage  sabotage  tampering or other breaches of security by computer virus  break ins or otherwise that could impair its functionality 
in addition  our network is subject to unknown capacity limitations that may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for our customers 
any interruptions in service resulting from physical damage or capacity limitations could cause our systems to fail 
network interconnection 
as a competitive provider of local telephone service  we must interconnect our network with the networks of incumbent local exchange carriers 
we may not be able to obtain the interconnection we require at rates and on terms and conditions that permit us to offer services that are both competitive and profitable 
in the event that we experience difficulties in obtaining high quality  reliable and reasonably priced services from other carriers  the attractiveness of our services is likely to be significantly impaired 
dependence on local exchange carriers 
we rely on incumbent local exchange carriers to supply key unbundled components of their network infrastructure to us on a timely and accurate basis  and in the quantities and quality demanded by us 
we may from time to time experience delays or other problems in receiving unbundled services or facilities which we request  and there can be no assurance that we will able to obtain such unbundled elements on the scale and within the time frames required by us 
any failure to obtain these components  services or additional capacity on a timely and accurate basis could adversely affect us 
anticipated capital needs 
if we expand more rapidly than currently anticipated or if our working capital needs exceed our current expectations  we may need to raise additional capital from debt or equity sources 
if we cannot obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all  we may be required to modify  delay or abandon our current business plan  which is likely to materially and adversely affect our business and  as a result  the value of our common stock 
we have an accounts receivable facility with rfc corporation that provides for the sale of up to million of our receivables to rfc 
this facility expires in july dependence on third party vendors 
we currently purchase the majority of our telecommunications equipment as needed from third party vendors  including lucent technologies  inc  sonus networks  inc  dialogic communications corporation  hewlett packard company  compaq computer corporation  sun microsystems  inc and emc corporation 
in addition  we currently license our software from third party vendors  including oracle corporation  inprise corporation  mercator software  inc  microsoft corporation  nuance communications  inc  speechworks international  inc  telution  inc  ams  inc  netscape communications  inc 
and accenture 
we typically do not enter into any long term agreements with our telecommunications equipment or software suppliers 
any reduction or interruption in supply from our equipment suppliers or failure to obtain suitable software licensing terms could have a disruptive effect on our business and could adversely affect our results of operations 
dependence on management and key personnel 
we depend on a limited number of key personnel who would be difficult to replace 
if we lose the services of some of our key personnel  our business could suffer 
we currently maintain a  key man life insurance policy on the life of mr 
d 
gregory smith  our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
we also depend on a limited number of key management  sales  marketing and product development personnel to manage and operate our business 
in particular  we believe that our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  including our engineering and technical staff 
if we are unable to attract and retain our key employees  the value of our common stock could suffer 
risks related to our industry government regulation and legal uncertainties 
we are subject to varying degrees of federal  state  and local regulation 
in states where we will provide intrastate services  we generally will be subject to state certification or registration and tariff filing requirements 
delays in obtaining the required state regulatory approvals may have a material adverse effect on our business 
challenges to our tariffs by third parties could cause us to incur substantial legal and administrative expenses 
we must also comply with various state and federal obligations that are subject to change  such as the duty to contribute to universal service subsidies  the impact of which we cannot assess on a going forward basis as the rates change periodically 
while we do not believe that compliance with federal and state reporting and regulatory requirements will be burdensome  our failure to do so may result in fines or other penalties being imposed on us  including loss of certification to provide services 
decisions of the fcc and state regulatory commissions providing incumbent local exchange carriers with increased flexibility in how they price their services and with other regulatory relief  could have a material adverse effect on our business and that of other competitive local exchange carriers 
future regulatory provisions may be less favorable to competitive local exchange carriers and more favorable to their competitors 
if incumbent local exchange carriers are allowed by regulators to lower their retail rates  engage in substantial volume and term discount pricing practices for their end user customers  or charge competitive local exchange carriers higher fees for interconnection to the incumbent local exchange carriers networks  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
incumbent local exchange carriers may also seek to delay competitors through legal or regulatory challenges  or by recalcitrant responses to requirements that they open their markets through interconnection and unbundling of network elements 
our legal and administrative expenses may be increased because of our having to actively participate in rate cases filed by incumbent local exchange carriers  in which they seek to increase the rates they can charge for the unbundled network element platform components 
our profitability may be adversely affected if those carriers prevail in those cases 
pending court cases  in which certain provisions of the telecommunications act of will be conclusively interpreted  may result in an increase in our cost of obtaining unbundled network elements 
we are also subject to federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting slamming  which occurs when specific procedures are not followed when a customer changes telecommunications services 
although we attempt to diligently comply with all such laws and regulations and have procedures in place to prevent slamming  if violations of such laws and regulations occur  we could become subject to significant fines and penalties  legal fees and costs  and our business reputation could be harmed 
competition 
the telecommunications and information services markets are intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
we expect competition to increase in the future 
many of our potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and substantially greater financial  personnel  marketing  engineering  technical and other resources than us 
we believe the principal competitive factors affecting our business operations will be price  the desirability of our service offering  quality and reliability of our services  innovation and customer service 
our ability to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to maintain high quality  market driven services at prices generally equal to or below those charged by our competitors 
competitor actions and responses to our actions could  therefore  materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face competition from a variety of participants in the telecommunications market 
the largest competitor for local service in each market in which we compete is the incumbent local exchange carrier serving that market 
incumbent local exchange carriers have established networks  long standing relationships with their customers  strong political and regulatory influence  and the benefit of state and federal regulations that  until recently  favored incumbent local exchange carriers 
in the local exchange market  the incumbent local exchange carriers continue to hold near monopoly positions 
the long distance telecommunications market in which we compete has numerous entities competing for the same customers and a high average churn rate as customers frequently change long distance providers in response to the offering of lower rates or promotional incentives 
prices in the long distance market have declined significantly in recent years and are expected to continue to decline 
we will face competition from large interexchange carriers 
other competitors are likely to include incumbent local exchange carriers providing out of region and  with the removal of regulatory barriers  in region long distance services  other incumbent local exchange carriers  other competitive local exchange carriers  cable television companies  electric utilities  wireless telephone system operators  microwave and satellite carriers and private networks owned by large end users 
the telecommunications act of facilitates such entry by requiring incumbent local exchange carriers to allow competing providers to acquire local services at wholesale prices for resale and to purchase unbundled network elements at cost based prices 
a continuing trend toward combinations and strategic alliances in the telecommunications industry  including potential consolidation among incumbent local exchange carriers or competitive local exchange carriers  or transactions between telephone companies and cable companies outside of the telephone company s service area  or between interexchange carriers and competitive local exchange carriers  could give rise to significant new competitors 
the enhanced and information services markets are also highly competitive and we expect that competition will continue to intensify 
our competitors in these markets will include information service providers  telecommunications companies  on line service providers and internet service providers 
unauthorized transactions  theft of services 
we may be the victim of fraud or theft of service 
from time to time  callers have obtained our services without rendering payment by unlawfully using our access numbers and personal identification numbers 
we attempt to manage these theft and fraud risks through our internal controls and our monitoring and blocking systems 
if these efforts are not successful  the theft of our services may cause our revenue to decline significantly 
to date  we have not encountered material fraud or theft of our service 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not currently utilize derivative financial instruments 
our operations are conducted primarily in the united states and as such are not subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
we have no material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt obligations  as substantially all of our long term debt obligations are fixed rate obligations
