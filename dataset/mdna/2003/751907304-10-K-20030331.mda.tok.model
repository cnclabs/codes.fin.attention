for additional information concerning these and other factors  see expected future results of operations in this item since its inception  the company has been primarily engaged in the research and development of ferroelectric technology and the design  development and commercialization of fram products and enhanced dram products 
revenue has been derived from the sale of the company s fram and enhanced dram products beginning in the company has also generated revenue under license and development agreements entered into with a limited number of established semiconductor manufacturers and involving the development of specific applications of the company s technologies 
accordingly  fluctuations in the company s revenue have resulted primarily from the timing of significant product orders  the timing of the signing of license and development agreements  and the achievement of related performance milestones 
for  and  fram product sales represented approximately  and of total product sales revenue  respectively  ems product sales accounted for  and  respectively  while mushkin product sales represented  and for the same periods 
during these periods  product sales revenue accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total revenue  the remainder of which were generated principally from license and development fees  royalties and customer sponsored research and development revenue 
as a result of the company s limited revenue as compared to its substantial ongoing product research and development costs and high manufacturing costs for certain of its products  the company has incurred losses on a consolidated basis in each fiscal year since its inception and has required substantial capital infusions in the form of debt and equity financing 
page the company has entered into development and or licensing arrangements with several major semiconductor manufacturers  namely hitachi  rohm  toshiba  fujitsu  cypress semiconductor  hewlett packard  infineon and texas instruments  to advance the development of both its fram products and enhanced dram products and to provide the company with access to advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes and capacity for such products 
the company has also entered into license agreements with samsung and nec  although such arrangements do not include any development activities between the company and the licensee or the availability of manufacturing capacity to the company 
in march  the company entered into a two year joint development agreement with fujitsu to pursue the development of advanced fram manufacturing processes

page during  quarterly revenue was million  million  million and million for the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
significant increases in revenue during the third and fourth quarters as compared to the first and second quarters are the result of increased product sales from our fram and mushkin business units and increased license and development fee revenue related to engaging with texas instruments on a technology license and development agreement during the third quarter 
our fram business unit product revenue increased as a result of a wider product portfolio and the initial shipments into the ampy metering program 
product sales at our mushkin business unit increased during the second half of as a result of adding sales personnel to facilitate direct customer sales  expanding our sales channels beyond internet sales 
cost of sales 
overall cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenue during increased from to approximately as compared with cost of sales associated with the company s fram products increased to in compared to in this increase is primarily attributable to high production costs for initial deliveries of product into the ampy enel metering program  a major customer program to replace million utility meters in italy 
the pre production phase of this program was completed in with the production ramp beginning in the first quarter of a design revision to reduce costs is complete and production wafers are currently being manufactured 
the company expects to consume the remaining high cost units and begin delivery of the lower cost parts during the first quarter of during the company also recorded expenses of  for excess and obsolete inventories which are included in cost of product sales

quarterly increases in fram cost of sales as a percentage of product revenue is primarily attributable to high production costs for initial deliveries of product into the ampy metering program 
during the fourth quarter ems cost of sales increased substantially as a percentage of product revenue due to a charge for excess and obsolete inventories 
our mushkin business unit also experienced increased cost of sales as a percentage of product revenue during  primarily because of decreases in the average selling prices per megabit of memory  due to extreme pricing pressure in world wide commodity dram markets during page research and development 
during research and development costs including customer sponsored research and development increased million to million as compared to million in during and the company incurred research and development expenses related to new product development programs in both the company s fram and enhanced dram business units 
throughout the company was engaged in a micron advanced fram manufacturing process development program with fujitsu 
this development program provided the company with research and development funding and wafer fabrication processing equipment supplied by fujitsu and was successfully completed in the fourth quarter of funding to ramtron in from this agreement totaled million 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative sg a expenses including stock based compensation for decreased  to million  a decrease of as compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction of stock based compensation see stock based compensation below of million

interest expense 
related party interest expense in increased  totaling million  and was primarily related to non cash amortization of a note payable discount for the valuation of stock warrants issued in connection with the amendment of the company s credit facility with the national electrical benefit fund 
page minority interest in subsidiary 
minority interest in losses of the company s ems subsidiary of approximately  was recognized in as compared to  in the minority interest reflects infineon s share of ems losses for and minority interest in net losses of ems were not recorded after march   due to the minority interest balance being reduced to zero on that date

during  the company recorded a loss of million on the disposition and impairment of these securities 
loss on sales and impairments were million in the third quarter and a gain on sales of  in the fourth quarter cumulative effect of accounting change 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
 which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
as a result  effective january   the company changed its method of recognizing revenue on certain payments resulting from technology licensing activities 
in prior years the company recognized non refundable technology license agreement payments when billed in accordance with contractual arrangements 
in accordance with sab no 
s guidance  the company now recognizes revenue related to technology licensing agreements over the licensing and or royalty bearing period 
the effect of this change in revenue recognition was to increase income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change by approximately  or per share in and  or per share in the cumulative effect of retroactively applying this change in accounting principle to periods prior to resulted in a one time non cash charge of million and is included in net loss for the year ended december  net loss applicable to common shares 
during  combined preferred stock dividends  and accretion of redeemable preferred stock increased by  to  this increase is attributable to a increase in the dividend rate as a result of the company s election to pay required dividends in the company s preferred stock instead of cash 
expected future results of operations the company s ability to significantly increase product sales and achieve profitability will depend on several factors  including i the completion of the development and qualification for manufacturing of new fram products  ii the completion of the development and qualification for manufacturing of the company s new enhanced dram products  iii participation the in ampy enel utility meter program throughout the life of such program  iv wider customer acceptance of its fram and enhanced dram products  v market acceptance and adoption of our customer s products  vi market acceptance of page new fram and enhanced dram products which may be developed  vii the company s ability to manufacture its products on a cost effective and timely basis through alliance foundry operations and third party foundry sources  viii the availability and related cost of future financing  ix factors not directly related to the company  including market conditions  competition  technological progression  product obsolescence and the changing needs of potential customers and the semiconductor industry in general  x memory market conditions and competitive forces which may negatively impact average selling prices of the company s products  xi negative trends in the global economy  and xii political conditions related to on going military actions against terrorism 
the company is continuing its efforts to improve and increase commercial production and sales of its fram and enhanced dram products  decrease the cost of producing such products and develop and commercialize new fram and enhanced dram products 
the company expects revenue will continue to be sporadic in the foreseeable future until the company s products gain wider market acceptance  milestones under existing customer sponsored product development programs are achieved  new customer sponsored research and development programs are entered into  new license arrangements are entered into and milestones under the company s existing and any new license and development agreements are achieved 
product revenue growth in will be highly dependent upon product sales to one or more key customers 
in june  the company entered into a five year volume purchase agreement with ampy automaton digilog  ltd 
for the primary purpose of supplying approximately million units of fram product over a to year period for a utility meter replacement program at enel spa  a leading supplier of power in italy 
ramtron will also supply fram product to ampy for use in other meters it builds 
the agreement includes pricing provisions  purchase order placement  reschedule and order cancellation provisions 
there are no order quantity or schedule guarantees 
during the company supplied approximately million units into the production phase of this program and expects this program to represent a significant portion of the company s fram product revenue 
the company s ems business unit has been engaged with cypress semiconductor and hewlett packard to develop esram products 
the company s esram products will be available for sale in and will be the primary source of product revenue for ems 
hewlett packard is expected to use the esram in a new line of server products and is expected to be the primary customer for the esram products during any delay in the production ramp of these programs could significantly reduce revenue growth below current expectations for to gain access to advanced cmos manufacturing processes and facilities  ramtron has entered into manufacturing alliances and licensing agreements for fram products with companies having or constructing advanced memory products manufacturing capability  including rohm  hitachi  toshiba  fujitsu  infineon and texas instruments 
since the purchase or construction of an advanced manufacturing facility capable of mass producing memory devices would require a capital outlay well beyond the company s current capital resources  the company believes that the most suitable alternative is this strategic page alliance approach  which the company believes will enable it to develop  manufacture and sell fram products more rapidly and cost effectively than any other available alternative 
ramtron s intention is to utilize current and future alliance relationships as foundry sources for fram products in order to provide the company with low cost  high volume  high quality fram products for resale to customers 
currently  the company s fram products are being manufactured under a foundry supply agreement with fujitsu 
from through august certain fram products were manufactured at rohm 
the company has not yet negotiated foundry supply agreements with hitachi  toshiba  infineon or texas instruments  but such companies are contractually bound to enter into such agreements upon fulfillment of certain conditions  primarily  the achievement of commercial manufacturing capabilities 
there is no assurance  however  that the company s alliance foundry partners will achieve commercial manufacturing capability in a timeframe sufficient to meet the company s capacity requirements  or at all 
currently  the company s enhanced dram products are being manufactured under a foundry agreement with infineon that extends through january this agreement allows the company access to infineon s most advanced dram processing technologies while avoiding the high capital costs associated with operating a dram manufacturing facility that would have otherwise been incurred by the company if it had chosen to manufacture these products with company provided resources 
as a result of industry wide oversupply of semiconductor memory products  significant price decreases within the industry have occurred during the past several years 
historically  the semiconductor memory industry has experienced declining average selling prices  and the company believes these declines will continue to affect the company 
accordingly  the company s ability to increase revenue and margins on its products depends on the company s ability to increase unit sales volumes and to introduce new products with higher margins or further reduce its manufacturing costs to offset the declines in average selling prices 
absent these actions  declining average selling prices would have an adverse effect on the company s gross profit margins and the overall financial performance of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase unit sales volumes  introduce new  higher margin products or reduce its manufacturing costs in the future 
in addition  the company periodically writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or lack of marketability 
during  and  the company recorded charges of   and  respectively  for such losses 
there can be no assurance that the company will not record write downs for obsolescence or lack of marketability in future periods 
such write downs  if material  could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
page liquidity and capital resources since its inception  because revenue generated from operations and licensing has been insufficient to fund operations  the company has depended for funding principally on its ability to raise equity capital through private placements of stock and lines of credit 
in  the company entered into a loan facility  bearing interest at  with the national electrical benefit fund the fund  an investment fund established for the purpose of providing retirement and related benefits to employees in the electrical contracting and related industries 
during  the company and the fund agreed to amend the terms of the credit facility extending the maturity date to march   decreasing the interest rate to and requiring the company maintain certain financial ratios  as defined in the loan document 
in july  the note was again amended to extend the maturity date to july  the company s borrowings under the fund s credit facility totaled approximately million 
on august   the company exercised the prepayment provision of the note by notifying the fund of the company s intention to prepay the balance due no later than january  on november   the fund elected to accept payment in lieu of a conversion to the company s common stock 
all principal and accrued interest due  totaling approximately million  was paid to the fund on november  the company raised funds through the private placement of preferred and common stock in   and also  the company and infineon entered into a share purchase agreement dated december  pursuant to which infineon agreed to invest approximately million in the company  million in cash and million in infineon common stock  shares  in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock 
the initial closing occurred february   providing the company with million in exchange for  shares of common stock 
the final closing was completed on march   providing the company  infineon shares 
all  infineon shares were sold by the company during  generating approximately million in cash 
on march  the company issued million of year  fixed rate  convertible debentures to infineon  halifax fund  managed by the palladin group  lp and bramwell capital corporation  managed by cavallo capital 
the debentures are convertible into the company s common stock at a fixed conversion price of  which is equal to the five day volume weighted average price vwap of the company s common stock prior to the transaction signing 
the company may force conversion of the debenture after months  provided the vwap of the company s common stock is at least of the conversion price for or more of consecutive trading days 
the debenture is secured by a deed of trust on the company s headquarters facility in colorado springs  colorado and certain accounts receivable 
in addition   year common stock warrants were issued to the investors at an exercise price of per share 
page the debenture agreement requires the company to meet certain financial covenants 
for  those covenants include capital expenditures not to exceed of gross revenue from sales  ebitda earnings of  for each six month period ending june   september  and december   and ebitda earnings for any fiscal quarter in not to exceed negative  cash and cash equivalents decreased by  in to million 
cash flow used for operations decreased from million in to million in cash generated by operating income  after non cash charges was  in compared to a use of cash of million in additionally  working capital requirements increased approximately million as compared to  primarily due to growth in accounts receivable and inventories to support a growth in product sales during accounts receivable increased million in from million at the end of as a result of increased product revenue in the fourth quarter of as compared to product revenue in and million in accounts receivable from third quarter shipments to a subcontract manufacturer on the ampy enel program who has delayed payment to the company 
during the first quarter of the company collected approximately of the outstanding balance due from this customer 
based on the subsequent payments and other information available to management  the company believes the remaining balance will ultimately be collected and  as such  no reserves have been recorded related to this outstanding balance 
the amount the company will ultimately receive in future payments from this customer could differ materially from the amounts recorded as of december  and could require additional charges for uncollectible accounts receivable 
inventories increased by in from million at the end of to million at the end of this increase is due to a fourth quarter slow down in shipments into the ampy enel program as enel depleted some excess inventories 
the company expects to deplete the increased inventory quantities during the first or months of accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased on a year over year basis from million at the end of to million at the end of this increase is primarily attributable to increased fram inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in deferred revenue decreased million from million at the end of to million at the end of this decrease is primarily related to earning previously deferred revenue related to the texas instruments licensing and technology development agreements the company entered into during additionally  the company recorded million of deferred revenue related to a fram technology license milestone payment from an existing licensee 
deferred revenue related to this milestone will be amortized into revenue over the year remaining life of such technology license 
page cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million of cash generated by investing activities in in  the company generated approximately million from the sale of  shares of infineon common stock 
capital expenditures were  in compared to  in expenditures for intellectual property remained relatively flat at  in and  in cash provided by financing activities was million in the company generated net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of convertible debentures to infineon  halifax fund  lp and bramwell capital corporation pursuant to a share purchase agreement dated march  the company used million to redeem the remaining outstanding convertible preferred stock on july   its maturity date 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was million  which was raised from the issuance of million common stock to infineon and offset by the repayment of a million note payable to the national electrical benefit fund 
equipment and plant expenditures are expected to be minimal during the company has incurred net losses from operations since inception 
the company s ability to achieve profitable operations is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  success in raising additional financing to fund operations  achieving forecasted revenue growth  maintaining gross profit margins and entering into additional license and research and development arrangements 
there is no guarantee that the company will be successful in addressing such risks 
the company s current business plan contemplates revenue growth in due to increasing market penetration of the company s fram products and the introduction of new enhanced dram products 
in addition  the company obtained a million line of credit with wells fargo in march that is secured by certain accounts receivable and the company s inventories see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes these factors  along with cash on hand as of december   will be sufficient to fund its operations at least through december  in view of the company s expected future working capital requirements in connection with the design  manufacturing and sale of its fram and enhanced dram products  the company s projected continuing research and development expenditures  other projected operating expenditures and the results of pending patent litigation  the company may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there is no assurance  however  that the company will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
any issuance of common or preferred stock to obtain additional funding would result in further dilution of existing stockholders interests in ramtron 
the inability to obtain additional financing when needed would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results and could adversely affect the company s ability to continue business operations 
page contractual commitments 
for more information on the company s contractual obligations on operating leases and contractual commitments  see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company s commitments under these obligations were as follows in thousands operating nebf convertible leases consulting fee debenture total total    these consulting fees are required to be paid to nebf as long as nebf owns at least of the outstanding shares of the company 
the company s ems subsidiary has entered into an agreement with its subcontract assembly and test supplier 
if the committed volume of  units under this agreement are not manufactured by the end of  ems may be liable for per unit for the volume shortfall 
legal matters 
the company is currently involved in a patent interference proceeding see item patent interference proceeding and note in the consolidated financial statements 
if the company is ultimately unsuccessful in these proceedings  there would be no retroactive cash payment requirements from the company to the junior party as a result of such an adverse decision 
while the company cannot accurately estimate the financial effects of such a result  the company believes that it could  depending on when a final non appealable judgment is ultimately rendered  materially adversely affect the company s fram product business and operating results and  thus  have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition as a whole 
critical accounting policies 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
page revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales to direct customers is recognized upon shipment as the company generally does not have any post shipment obligations or allow for any acceptance provisions 
the company defers recognition of sales to distributors that are given rights of return and price protection by the company until the distributors have resold the products 
the company records the cash received on these sales prior to the distributor reselling the product as deferred revenue 
revenue from licensing programs is recognized over the period the company is required to provide services under the terms of the agreement 
revenue from research and development activities that are funded by customers are recognized as the services are performed  generally  as contractual milestones are met 
in situations where the company licenses its technology and also provides development assistance  the company records the total proceeds to be received as revenue over the longer licensing period 
revenue from royalties is recognized upon the shipment of product from the company s technology license partners to direct customers 
significant policies affected by judgments and estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company records license and customer sponsored research and development revenue on arrangements entered into with customers 
the revenue recorded by the company in each reporting period is dependent upon estimates regarding the cost of projects and the achievement of milestones 
changes in estimates regarding these matters could result in revisions to the amount of revenue recognized on these arrangements 
while the company maintains a stringent credit approval process  significant judgments are made by management in connection with assessing our customers ability to pay at the time of shipment 
despite this assessment  from time to time  our customers are unable to meet their payment obligations 
we continue to monitor our customers credit worthiness  and use our judgment in establishing the estimated amounts of customer receivables which will ultimately not be collected 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or lack of marketability for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
page the company reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable 
under current standards  the assets must be carried at historical cost if the projected cash flows from their use will recover their carrying amounts on an undiscounted basis and without considering interest 
however  if projected cash flows are less than their carrying value  the long lived assets must be reduced to their estimated fair value 
considerable judgment is required to project such cash flows and  if required  estimate the fair value of the impaired long lived asset 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
there can be no assurance that future long lived asset impairments will not occur 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangibles sfas no 
and ceased amortization of its goodwill 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired

page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial positions  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating activities 
all of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars and the company currently has no derivative financial instruments 
interest payable on the company s convertible debentures is fixed at over the term of the debentures 
as such  changes in interest rates will not affect future earnings or cash flows 
the company manages interest rate risk by investing its excess cash in cash equivalents bearing variable interest rates  which are tied to various market indices 
the company does not believe that near term changes in interest rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
the net effect of a change in interest rates on outstanding cash and cash equivalents at december  would have less than an  effect on the earnings or cash flows 
the company has a wholly owned subsidiary located in japan 
the operating costs of this subsidiary are denominated in japanese yen  thereby creating exposures to exchange rate variations 
to date  this subsidiary has had only limited operations and is expected to continue to have limited operations in the foreseeable future  and  therefore  the company does not believe any changes in exchange rates will have a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term variations in exchange rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company  and therefore  the company has chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging instruments 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in japanese currency valuation 
average selling prices of the company s products have not increased significantly as a result of inflation during the past several years  primarily due to intense competition within the semiconductor industry 
the effect of inflation on the company s costs of production has been minimized through improvements in production efficiencies 
the company anticipates that these factors will continue to minimize the effects of any foreseeable inflation and other price pressures within the industry and markets in which the company participates
