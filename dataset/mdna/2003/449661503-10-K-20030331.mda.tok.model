any unused genesis nols will expire in in addition  section of the code imposes additional limitations on the utilization of nols by a corporation following various types of ownership changes which result in more than a change in ownership of a corporation within a three year period 
such changes may result from new common stock issuances by the company or changes occurring as a result of filings with the securities and exchange commission of schedules d and g by holders of more than of the common stock  whether involving the acquisition or disposition of common stock 
if such a subsequent change occurs  the limitations of section would apply and may limit or deny the future utilization of the nol by the company  which could result in the company paying substantial additional federal and state taxes
