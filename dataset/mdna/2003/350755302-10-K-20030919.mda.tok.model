item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company has developed criteria for determining whether a shipment should be recorded as a sale or as a deferred sale a balance sheet liability 
the criteria for recording a cod sale  or payments prior to shipment sale or sale financed through third party floor plan arrangements are that the boat has been completed and shipped to a customer  that title has passed to the customer  and that there is no direct commitment to repurchase the boat or to pay floor plan interest beyond the sales program terms 
as described more fully below at business environment  most of the company s shipments to dealers were financed through floor plan arrangements with third party lenders pursuant to which the company is subject to repurchase boats repossessed by the third party lenders if the dealer defaults under his credit arrangement 
the company has no repurchase liability for the balance of shipments 
this is the method of sales recognition believed to be in use by most boat manufacturers 
at june    and  there were no commitments to dealers to pay the interest on floor plan financed boats in excess of the time period specified in the company s written sales program and there were no direct repurchase agreements 
there were no deferred sales or cost of sales estimated at june    and the company has a contingent liability to repurchase boats where it participates in the floor plan financing made available to its dealers by third party finance companies 
this liability amounted to approximately   and  at june   and  respectively 
sales to participating dealers are approved by the respective finance companies 
if a participating dealer does not satisfy its obligation to the lender and the boat is subsequently repossessed by the lender  then the company may be required to repurchase the boat

effects of inflation 
the company has not been materially affected by the moderate inflation of recent years 
since most of the company s plant and its equipment are relatively new  expenditures for replacements are not expected to be a factor in the near term future 
when raw material costs increase because of inflation  the company attempts to minimize the effect of these increases by using alternative  less costly materials  or by finding less costly sources for the materials it uses 
when the foregoing measures are not possible  selling prices are increased to recover the cost increases 
the company s products are targeted at the segment of the powerboat market where retail purchasers are generally less significantly affected by price or other economic conditions 
consequently  management believes that the impact of inflation on sales and the results of operations will not be material
