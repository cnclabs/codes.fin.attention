item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the matters discussed in this report on form k  when not historical matters  are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results 
such factors include  among others  the speculative nature of mineral exploration  commodity prices  production and reserve estimates  environmental and government regulations  availability of financing  force majeure events  and other risk factors as described from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
many of these factors are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update its forward looking statements  whether as a result of receiving new information  the occurrence of future events  or otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates the ensuing discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and contained within this report on form k 
certain amounts included in or affecting the company s financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring that certain assumptions be made with respect to values or conditions which cannot be made with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
therefore  the reported amounts of the company s assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates 
the more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for future cash flow estimates and units of production amortization determination  recoverability and timing of gold production from the heap leaching process  environmental  reclamation and closure obligations  asset impairments including estimates of future cash flows  useful lives and residual values of intangible assets  fair value of financial instruments  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following significant assumptions and estimates affect its more critical practices and accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
at least annually  the company estimates its ore reserves at its producing properties 
there are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves  including many factors beyond the control of the company 
ore reserve estimates are based upon engineering evaluations of assay values derived from samplings of drill holes and other openings 
additionally  declines in the market price of gold may render certain reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to mine 
further  availability of permits  changes in operating and capital costs  and other factors could materially and adversely affect ore reserves 
the company uses its ore reserve estimates in determining the unit basis for mine depreciation and closure rates  as well as in evaluating mine asset impairments 
changes in ore reserve estimates could significantly affect these items 
the company produces gold at its briggs mine using the heap leaching process 
this process involves the application of cyanide solutions by drip irrigation to ore stacked on an impervious pad 
as the solution percolates through the heap  gold is dissolved from the ore into solution 
this solution is collected and processed with activated carbon  which precipitates the gold out of solution and onto the carbon 
through the subsequent processes of acid washing and pressure stripping  the gold is returned to solution in a more highly concentrated state 
this concentrated solution of gold is then processed in an electrowinning circuit  which re precipitates the gold onto cathodes for melting into gold dore bars 
the company must make certain estimates regarding this overall process  the most significant of which are the amount and timing of gold to be recovered 
although the company can calculate with reasonable certainty the tonnage and grades of ore placed under leach by engineering survey and laboratory analysis of drill hole samples  the recovery and timing factors are influenced by the size of the ore under leach crushed or run of mine and the particular mineralogy of a deposit being mined 
the company bases its estimates on laboratory leaching models  which approximates the ore under leach on the heap 
from this data  the company estimates the amount of gold that can be recovered and the time it will take for recovery 
the company continually monitors the actual monthly and cumulative recovery from the heap as a check against the laboratory models  however  ultimate recovery will not be known with certainty until active leaching has stopped and pad rinsing is completed 
because it is impossible to physically measure the amount of gold under leach  the company calculates  or derives the amount  by taking the difference between the cumulative estimated recoverable gold placed on the heap and the known amount of gold cumulatively produced as dore 
based on a gold price of per ounce  if less gold is recovered than the company estimates exists on the heap at  this would have an impact on net income and cash flow of approximately million and million  respectively 
similar financial impacts would be recognized for varying recovery changes on a pro rata basis 
the company must capture and classify its inventory related costs to achieve the matching concept of expenses and revenues as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
costs capitalized to inventory relating to the heap leach pad include i the direct costs incurred in the mining and crushing of the rock and delivery of the ore onto the heap leach pad  ii applicable depreciation  depletion and amortization  and iii allocated indirect mine general and administrative overhead costs 
these costs are relieved from this inventory when gold is produced as dore  and added to i all direct costs incurred in the leaching and refining processes  ii applicable depreciation  depletion and amortization  and iii allocated indirect mine general and administrative overhead costs for determining the cost of inventory related to dore 
as the company s estimate of time to recover gold from first being placed under leach to dore production is twelve months  inventory costs are considered a current asset 
based on current reserves  the briggs mine will stop loading ore on the heap leach pad in the fourth quarter of and active leaching with cyanide will end in the fourth quarter of the company must estimate reclamation and site closure obligations well in advance of actual activities 
estimates are based primarily on environmental and regulatory requirements and are accrued and charged to expense over the expected economic life of the operation 
as additional information is obtained  revised estimates for producing operations are applied prospectively while revisions to estimates for operations already in the reclamation phase are reflected in net income in the period in which the revisions occur 
the company assesses its producing properties and undeveloped mineral claims and leases for impairment when events or changes in circumstances warrant and at least annually 
for producing properties and equipment  an impairment is recognized when the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest expected to result in the use of the asset are less than the carrying amount of that asset 
measurement of the impairment loss is based on discounted cash flows 
undeveloped mineral claims and leases are measured on a fair value basis 
fair value with respect to such mineral interests  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective january   would generally be assessed with reference to comparable property sales transactions in the market place 
however  the company is pursuing litigation and other courses of action to overturn  modify  or exempt the application of an anti mining initiative  i  passed in montana that is restricting development of the mcdonald and seven up pete mineral properties 
as an active market for regulatory overturns or exemptions and minerals takings lawsuits does not exist  and given the multiple potential outcomes of the litigation and other actions  the use of a decision analysis technique for estimating fair value is appropriate 
this approach combines the projected monetary values rewards and losses for each of the possible material outcomes with the estimated probability of occurrence 
the expected values associated with potential property development and certain takings outcomes are estimated using the traditional net present value analysis of revenues  costs and capital investment cash flow projections discounted at a risk adjusted rate reflective of the time periods associated with each possible outcome 
other ending values related to potential takings outcomes are estimated based on takings settlements that have occurred in other market situations 
based on this approach undertaken for the company by independent consultants  management believes that a reasonable estimate of a fair value in excess of the carrying value of  at december   has been appropriately determined 
assumptions underlying future cash flows estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties 
also  the occurrence of past market transactions does not mean that such comparable amounts would be applicable to the company s situation 
any differences between significant assumptions and market conditions could have a material effect on the fair value estimate 
there is also no assurance that the company will be successful in its litigation or other actions 
the company must estimate useful lives and residual values to establish amortization amounts for the carrying values of its intangible assets 
these assets  which are comprised of the company s mcdonald and seven up pete properties  are presently legally constrained from development due to the anti mining initiative  i the company has filed lawsuits seeking to have i declared unconstitutional  or alternatively  to obtain a takings or damage award for the lost value of the properties 
the company must use considerable judgment in establishing a litigation timeline and possible monetary outcomes  and utilizes external counsel and other consultants to establish these parameters 
the company has currently established an amortization period of eight years applied to the carrying values of the properties as restated 
the company utilizes derivative instruments to mitigate gold price risk for its operations 
these transactions are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidelines  and require the company to estimate fair values of its derivatives at each reporting date 
the unrealized gains and losses resulting from the calculations are included in net income currently  and can result in significant swings from one reporting period to the next depending on the then market price of gold 
the company must use significant judgment in assessing its ability to generate future taxable income to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets  which are principally in the form of net operating loss carryforwards and in applying a valuation allowance to all or part of these deferred tax assets using a more likely than not criterion 
the company is subject to litigation as the result of its business operations and transactions 
the company utilizes external counsel in evaluating potential exposure to adverse outcomes from judgments or settlements 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from the company s estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause the company to revise its estimates  net income will be affected 
restatement of prior financial information as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has identified certain accounting matters that require restatement to its consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and and prior 
for the year ended december   the impact of the adjustments was to increase the company s net loss by  or per share 
for the year ended december   the impact of the adjustments was to increase the company s net loss by  or per share 
the cumulative effect of these adjustments as of january  was to increase retained deficit at that date by  the adjustment were i to expense previously capitalized costs for the company s mcdonald gold project incurred since november and  ii to include depreciation  depletion and amortization as a cost in inventories at the company s briggs mine 
the company also determined that with the passage of the anti mining initiative  i  in montana in  certain mineral property assets previously included in property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet should have been reclassified to a separate intangible assets caption 
this change had no effect on reported results of operations or cash flows 
the amount reclassified was  at december  the company has also restated its results of operations for each of the quarters in and as discussed under selected quarterly financial data on page prior period amounts in the ensuing discussion have been adjusted for these restatements where applicable

total cash costs plus depreciation  depletion  amortization and accruals for site reclamation 
cash costs per ounce were higher in due to lower gold production 
the lower gold production was principally a result of completing pre stripping requirements at the goldtooth deposit  which resulted in significantly lower ore tons and ounces of gold placed on the leach pad for processing and recovery 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization was lower in due to lower ounces of gold sold  despite inclusion of the amortization of other intangible assets described in the following paragraph of which there was no comparable activity in on january   the company became subject to the accounting and reporting requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 as subsequently amended for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities with the issuance of sfas no 
these standards require that all derivatives be recognized as assets or liabilities and be measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedging instruments and the hedged items 
the fair market value of the company s gold hedges as of the adoption date of approximately million was recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment in other comprehensive income 
in addition  approximately million of deferred income arising from the deferral of gains realized in on the monetization of a gold loan and of certain gold forward contracts that were liquidated  and reported as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet  were reclassified as a cumulative effect adjustment in other comprehensive income 
during the first quarter of  the company closed out all forward contracts that existed on the adoption date at scheduled delivery dates with its counterparties 
the net gain of approximately million associated with the contracts was subsequently reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income and included in revenues in the statement of operations 
during the second quarter of  the company entered into additional floating rate forward contracts and  at december   had outstanding contracts on  ounces of gold at an average price of approximately per ounce 
the fair market value of the forward contracts was approximately million less than contractual amounts 
the unrealized mark to market loss is shown as a separate line item in the other income expense section in the statement of operations

during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an impairment loss of approximately million in connection with a reduction in the carrying value of long lived assets at its briggs mine to fair market value of approximately million 
fair market value was determined by discounted cash flow analysis utilizing an assumed future gold price of per ounce and a risk adjusted discount rate of approximately 
the impairment was principally due to i the company s forecast for a lower gold price than was estimated in prior periods  and ii the company s minimal hedge position relative to remaining reserves

during february march  the company raised approximately million through the sale of  two year convertible debentures of which approximately million was used to pay off the remaining briggs mine debt 
the company believes that its cash requirements over the next months can be funded through a combination of i existing cash  ii cash flow from operations  and iii cash raised in connection with the sale of the aforementioned debentures  net of the amount used to pay off the existing briggs mine debt 
if management s plans are not successful  operations and liquidity may be adversely impacted 
the company s long term liquidity may be impacted by the scheduled wind down of operations at the briggs mine during  which is currently the only internal source of cash flow 
the company is continually evaluating business opportunities with the objective of creating cash flow to sustain the corporation and advance its remaining principal asset  the mcdonald gold project  however there are no assurances of success in this regard or in the company s ability to secure additional financing through capital markets in the future

other matters mcdonald gold project anti mining initiative in november  the montana electorate passed an anti mining initiative i by a vote of to 
i  as modified by the state legislature in april  bans development of new gold and silver mines  which use open pit mining methods and cyanide in the treatment and recovery process 
in april  the spv filed lawsuits in montana state district court and in the united states district court  seeking to have i declared unconstitutional  or  alternatively  to obtain a takings or damage award for the lost value of the mcdonald  seven up pete and keep cool mineral properties 
these lawsuits are based on  amongst others  i the right not to be deprived of property without due process of law  ii the right to equal protection under the laws  and iii the right to be protected against laws which impair the obligations of existing contracts 
the united states district court issued a ruling august  in which the court dismissed the spv s substantive due process claim but  as requested by the spv  ruled that the remainder of the spv s claims could be pursued at such time as the state lawsuit was concluded 
the montana state district court issued a ruling november  in response to a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment by the state of montana 
in this ruling  the court dismissed four of the spv s fourteen counts  including its substantive due process and equal protection challenges to i s validity 
the decision maintained for adjudication the contract impairment validity challenge  contract damage claims  and all of the takings claims 
following the november ruling by the state district court  the state filed a new motion for summary judgment as to all claims 
in an order dated december   the court granted the state summary judgment on all of the remaining legal claims of the company s lawsuit 
on january   the company filed an appeal with the montana state supreme court of the state district court order 
state leases on september   the montana department of natural resources dnrc  the entity that administers state mineral leases  unilaterally decided to cancel the permitting extension of the year lease term of the state leases that pertain to the mcdonald gold project which would require the company  after a period of approximately seventeen months  to commence paying a delay rental of  per month in order to maintain the leases 
in february  pursuant to its september decision  the dnrc determined that the primary terms of the mineral leases had expired 
the company appealed the action of the dnrc in an administrative hearing process and the dnrc hearing examiner affirmed the dnrc action 
it is the company s position that the permitting process has been interrupted by the threat and passage of i and  thus  the permit extension is continued until the governmental impediment is resolved 
as part of the i lawsuit filed in april against the state of montana  the company asked the court to review and invalidate the dnrc s action  however  the court  in its december  order as described in the preceding paragraph  denied the company s petition for judicial review 
on january   the company filed an appeal with the montana supreme court 
kendall mine lawsuit and preliminary injunction in october  a plaintiff group filed suit in montana district court against the company and its wholly owned subsidiary  cr kendall corporation  alleging violation of water rights and other torts in connection with the operation of the kendall mine 
the complaint seeks unspecified damages and punitive damages 
the company believes the allegations are completely without merit and that the company will prevail in this matter 
in august  a preliminary injunction was issued in montana district court on behalf of the plaintiff group in connection with the company s auction of certain mineral rights and fee lands in western montana 
in october  the court issued a supplemental order which will sequester up to  of any proceeds realized from the auction until such time as the lawsuit is concluded 
as of december    had been remitted to the court as required by the order 
the company has filed an appeal to this order with the montana state supreme court 
environmental regulation in  the montana state legislature passed legislation which streamlined the permitting process of new industrial projects by reorganizing the several state agencies that had jurisdiction over environmental permitting into one new central agency  the department of environmental quality deq 
this agency is responsible for acting on an application for a hard rock mining operating permit in connection with a plan of operations filed by the seven up pete joint venture for the mcdonald gold project 
this permit  as well as several other local  state and federal permits  including a joint state and federal environmental impact statement eis  will be required before permits can be issued 
there are no assurances that all permits will be issued nor that  in the event they are issued  such issuances will be timely  nor that conditions contained in the permits will not be so onerous as to preclude construction and operation of the project 
moreover  with the passage of i in november  the company cannot presently proceed with permitting and development of the mcdonald gold project 
the kendall mine operates under permits granted by the montana department of environmental quality deq 
costs incurred for reclamation and closure activities at the kendall mine in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
costs to date total million and the company s estimate of total costs to achieve mine closure is million 
the company has  on deposit in an interest bearing account with the deq for reclamation at the kendall mine 
in february  the deq issued a decision that a comprehensive environmental impact statement eis is needed for completion of reclamation at kendall 
the company feels that it is crucial that reclamation proceed at kendall without further delay and  therefore  disagrees with the agency decision  and is presently evaluating its course of action with regard to the deq s action 
the company s estimate to achieve mine closure could be impacted by the outcome of an agency decision following an eis 
the briggs mine operates under permits granted by various agencies including the us bureau of land management blm  inyo county  the california department of conservation  and the lahontan regional water equality control board lahontan 
these agencies have jointly required the company to post a reclamation bond in the amount of  to ensure appropriate reclamation 
additionally  the company was required by lahontan to post a  bond to ensure adequate funds to mitigate any foreseeable release of pollutants to state waters 
both bonds are subject to annual review and adjustment 
in april  the california legislature passed a bill which stipulates that  if a project is located within one mile of a native american sacred site and on limited use lands within the california desert conservation area cdca  new open pit metal mine projects must be backfilled during reclamation and any disturbances to sacred sites must be mitigated to the sole satisfaction of the native american tribe 
the company s briggs project is located in the panamint range within the designated limited use land of the cdca and the nearby timbisha shoshone native american tribe has stated that they consider the entire project area to be sacred 
the company could be prohibited from developing any additional gold deposits in the panamint range due to passage of this law 
on december   the california state mining and geology board csmgb enacted an emergency backfill regulation  for days  that essentially requires that all future metal mines be backfilled to the original contour of the landscape 
on april   the csmgb made this backfill regulation permanent 
because of the high cost of backfilling  this regulation essentially eliminates any potential new mines on the company s properties in the panamint range 
based upon current knowledge  the company believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations as currently promulgated 
however  the exact nature of environmental control problems  if any  which the company may encounter in the future cannot be predicted primarily because of the increasing number  complexity and changing character of environmental requirements that may be enacted or of the standards being promulgated by federal and state authorities 
federal legislation legislation has been introduced in prior sessions of the united states congress to modify the requirements applicable to mining claims on federal lands under the mining law of to date  no such legislation has been enacted
