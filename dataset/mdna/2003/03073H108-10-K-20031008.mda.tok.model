item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements 
the results described below are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in any future period 
certain statements in this discussion and analysis  including statements regarding our strategy  financial performance  and revenue sources  are forward looking statements based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements  including those described in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
significant estimates made by the company include valuation of loans  evaluation of the recoverability of various receivables and the assessment of litigation and other contingencies 
the company s ability to collect receivables and recover the value of its loans depends on a number of factors  including financial conditions and its ability to enforce provisions of its contracts in the event of disputes  through litigation if necessary  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  to record net assets and liabilities at estimated realizable values 
the matters that give rise to such provisions are inherently uncertain and may require complex and subjective judgments 
although the company believes that estimates and assumptions used in determining the recorded amounts of net assets and liabilities at june   are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from the estimated amounts recorded in the company s financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are those applicable to the valuation of loans receivable and various investments discussed below 
valuation of loans and debt securities 
for loans and debt securities  fair value generally approximates cost less unrealized depreciation and no loans have been recorded above cost 
overall financial condition of the borrower  the adequacy of the collateral  individual credit risks  historical loss experience and other factors lead to a determination of the fair value at a different amount 
equity securities 
the fair value of publicly traded corporate equity securities is based on quoted market prices 
privately held corporate equity securities are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value 
for these non quoted investments  the company reviews the assumptions underlying the financial performance of the privately held companies in which the investments are maintained 
if and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary  the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value 
assets acquired in satisfaction of loans 
assets acquired in satisfaction of loans are carried at estimated fair value less selling costs 
losses incurred at the time of foreclosure are charged to the unrealized depreciation on loans receivable 
subsequent reductions in estimated net realizable value are recorded as losses on assets acquired in satisfaction of loans 
general ameritrans acquired elk in december  elk is an sbic that has been operating since  making loans to and  to a limited extent  investments in small businesses  primarily businesses that are majority owned by persons who qualify under sba regulations as socially or economically disadvantaged 
most of elk s business has consisted of originating and servicing loans collateralized by new york city  boston  chicago and miami taxi medallions  but elk also makes loans to and investments in other diversified businesses and to persons who qualify under sba regulations as non disadvantaged 
historically  elk s earnings derived primarily from net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets consisting of business loans  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities consisting of indebtedness to elk s banks and subordinated debentures issued to the sba 
net interest income is a function of the net interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  as well as the average balance of interest earning assets as compared to interest bearing liabilities 
unrealized depreciation on loans and investments is recorded when elk adjusts the value of a loan to reflect management s estimate of the fair value  as approved by the board of directors 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for the years ended june  and total investment income the company s investment income increased  to  as compared with the prior year ended june  this increase was mainly due to the increase in interest earned on higher average loans receivable balance for the year of  offset by a decrease in other fees of  operating expenses interest expense for the years ended june  decreased  to  when compared to the year ended june  this reflects the lower interest charged on outstanding bank borrowing combined with interest savings due to paydown and reissuance of sba debentures  offset by interest payments related to swap agreements since the fixed rates in connection with the swaps were consistently above the floating one month libor rates during the year 
salaries and employee benefits increased  when compared with the prior year 
this increase reflects the increases that were put in effect from the officers employment agreements  three of which were amended during the year 
other administrative costs increased  when compared with the prior year 
this increase was due to increased professional fees and related costs as a result of increased regulatory filings and examinations 
the company also incurred  in foreclosure expenses for the year ended june   which increased  from the prior year due to the increase in the number of foreclosures from the weak chicago market 
depreciation in value of loans and accrued interest increased  to  due mainly to the write down of the company s chicago loan portfolio and accrued interest 
the increase in write off and depreciation of interest and loans receivable is primarily due to the increase in chicago loan portfolio delinquencies and defaults  which is attributed to the economic slowdown and the effects of september  on the chicago taxi industry 
activities in connection with the chicago operations as of june  are as follows a  of charge off of principal due to losses on of the completed chicago medallion foreclosures that occurred during the year ended june  and b  of accrued interest on the completed chicago medallion foreclosures was written off 
in addition  the company increased its unrealized depreciation on interest receivable for potential losses on the remaining chicago taxi medallion loans that were in default by an additional net amount of  for the year ended june  as mentioned above  the foreclosure expenses incurred by the company as it satisfies outstanding balances incurred by the default borrowers on the medallions with the city of chicago were  for the year ended june  this expense primarily consisted of back taxes  interest and penalties owed to the city of chicago department of revenue by defaulted medallion owners which was required to be paid as a condition of completing the medallion foreclosures sales and transfer to new purchasers  as well as professional fees related to these foreclosures 
net income net income decreased to  from  in the year ended june  the change in the net income for the year ended june  that was attributable primarily to the write down of the chicago loan portfolio as well as increases in salary and professional fees which were only partially offset by favorable interest rates obtained from debt refinancing 
dividends of participating preferred stock for the year ended june  amounted to  versus  in the prior year 
results of operations for the years ended june  and total investment income the company s investment income decreased  to  as compared with the prior year ended june  this decrease was mainly due to the decrease in interest earned on loans receivable   offset by an increase in other fees 
this decrease reflects a lower average interest rate earned on the company s outstanding loan portfolio 
operating expenses interest expense for the years ended june  decreased  to  when compared to the year ended june  this reflects the lower interest charged on outstanding bank borrowing combined with a paydown of the notes payable  bank and an sba debenture in the amount of  as a result of the company s successful public offering of  units in april salaries and employee benefits increased  when compared with the prior year 
this increase reflects the increases that were put in effect when the officers signed employment agreements combined with a temporary increase in staff due to the implementation of the company s new computer system 
other administrative costs decreased  when compared with the prior year 
this decrease was mainly due to decreased miscellaneous administrative expenses and loss on assets acquired in satisfaction of loans  net 
the company also incurred  in foreclosure expenses for the year ended june  depreciation in value of loans and accrued interest increased  to  due mainly to the write down of the company s chicago loan portfolio and accrued interest 
net income net income increased to  from  in the year ended june  the change in the net income for the year ended june  that was attributable to other income expense amounted to  this change was primarily due to a one time charge of  due to the termination of the company s merger talks with medallion  net of  gain on the sale of equity securities for the year ended june  balance sheet and reserves total assets increased by  as of june  when compared to total assets as of june  this increase was due to the company s increased borrowings from the sba 
during january  the company and the sba entered into an agreement whereby the sba committed to reserve debentures in the amount of  to be issued by the company prior to september  as of june   debentures payable to the sba in the amount of  and  were drawn from the reserved pool of  in september and december  the company paid off sba debentures in the amount of  and  in order to reduce interest costs 
asset liability management interest rate sensitivity ameritrans  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent its interest earning assets consisting of medallion loans and commercial loans rise or fall at a different rate over time in comparison to its interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of its credit facilities with banks and subordinated sba debentures 
a relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from ameritrans interest rate sensitivity gap ie the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which mature and or reprice within specified intervals of time 
the gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities and negative when repriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets 
a relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval expressed as a percentage of total assets 
ameritrans interest rate sensitive assets were approximately million and interest rate sensitive liabilities were approximately million at june  having interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates  although such an asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates 
abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at the higher prevailing interest rates 
conversely  having interest earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on the average than liabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  although this asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of falling interest rates 
this mismatch between maturities and interest rate sensitivities of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities results in interest rate risk 
the effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolio 
based on past experience  ameritrans anticipates that approximately of the portfolio will mature or be prepaid each year 
ameritrans believes that the average life of its loan portfolio varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates 
borrowers are more likely to exercise prepayment rights in a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
conversely  borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising interest rate environment 
interest rate swap agreements ameritrans manages the exposure of the portfolio to increases in market interest rates by entering into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of its variable rate debt against increases in interest rates and by incurring fixed rate debt consisting primarily of subordinated sba debentures 
on january   elk entered into a  interest rate swap transaction with a bank that expired on october  on june   elk entered into an additional interest rate swap transaction with the same bank for  which expired on june  on june   elk entered into another interest rate swap transaction for  with this bank which expired june  on february   elk purchased another interest rate swap contract for  with the same bank expiring february  these swap transactions were entered into to protect the company from an upward movement in interest rates relating to outstanding bank debt 
these swap transactions call for a fixed rate of   and  respectively for the company and if the floating one month libor rate is below the fixed rate then the company is obligated to pay the bank for the difference in rates 
when the one month libor rate is above the fixed rate then the bank is obligated to pay the company for the differences in rates annually or at the settlement date 
ameritrans believes that its bank credit facilities and cash flow from operations after distributions to stockholders will be adequate to fund the continuing operations of the company s loan portfolio 
nevertheless  the company continues to explore additional options  which may increase available funds for its growth and expansion strategy 
in addition  to the application for sba funding described above  these financing options would provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth 
investment considerations interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the interest rate spread we receive on our taxicab medallion and commercial loans 
because we borrow money to finance the origination of loans  our income is dependent upon the differences between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we loan funds 
while the loans in our portfolio in most cases bear interest at fixed rates or adjustable rates  we finance a substantial portion of such loans by incurring indebtedness with floating interest rates 
as short term interest rates rise  our interest costs increase  decreasing the net interest rate spread we receive and thereby adversely affect our profitability 
although we intend to continue to manage our interest rate risk through asset and liability management  including the use of interest rate swaps  general rises in interest rates will tend to reduce our interest rate spread in the short term 
in addition  we rely on our counterparties to perform their obligations under such interest rate swaps 
a decrease in prevailing interest rates may lead to more loan prepayments  which could adversely affect our business 
a borrower is likely to exercise prepayment rights at a time when the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
in a lower interest rate environment  we will have difficulty re lending prepaid funds at comparable rates  which may reduce the net interest spread we receive 
our commercial loan activity has increased in recent years 
lending to small businesses involves a high degree of business and financial risk  which can result in substantial losses and should be considered speculative 
our borrower base consists primarily of small business owners that have limited resources and that are generally unable to achieve financing from traditional sources 
there is generally no publicly available information about these small business owners  and we must rely on the diligence of our employees and agents to obtain information in connection with our credit decisions 
in addition  these small businesses often do not have audited financial statements 
some smaller businesses have narrower product lines and market shares than their competition 
therefore  they may be more vulnerable to customer preferences  market conditions  or economic downturns  which may adversely affect the return on  or the recovery of  our investment in these businesses 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations through private and public placements of its securities  bank financing  the issuance to the sba of its subordinated debentures and internally generated funds 
on april   ameritrans completed a public offering of  units  consisting of one share of common stock  one share of cumulative participating redeemable preferred stock  face value  and one redeemable warrant exercisable into one share of common stock 
the gross proceeds from the sale were  less offering expenses of  a portion of the proceeds was used temporarily to reduce banks and sba indebtedness 
ameritrans also used part of the proceeds to start its own loan portfolio 
at june   of elk s indebtedness was represented by indebtedness to its banks and by the debentures issued to the sba with fixed rates of interest plus user fees which results in rates ranging from to 
elk currently may borrow up to  under its existing lines of credit  subject to the limitations imposed by its borrowing base agreement with its banks and the sba  the statutory and regulatory limitations imposed by the sba and the availability of funds 
in addition  during january  the company and the sba entered into an agreement whereby the sba committed to reserve debentures in the amount of  to be issued to the company on or prior to september  in july and december  new debenture payable to the sba were drawn from the reserved pool of  in the amount of  and  respectively 
the interim interest rates assigned were and  respectively 
the fixed rates of and were determined on the pooling dates of september  and march   respectively 
on september   another new debenture payable to the sba was drawn in the amount of  with an interim interest rate of 
the long term fixed rate will be determined on the pooling date of march  in addition to the fixed rates  there is an additional annual sba user fee of per annum that will also be charged making the rate  and before applicable amortization of points and fees 
our sources of liquidity are credit lines with banks  long term sba debentures that are issued to or guaranteed by the sba  loan amortization and prepayment 
as a ric  we distribute at least of our investment company taxable income 
consequently  we primarily rely upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
loan amortization and prepayments also provide a source of funding for elk 
prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
like elk  ameritrans will distribute at least of its investment company taxable income and  accordingly  we will continue to rely upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
in order to provide the funds necessary for our expansion strategy  we expect to raise additional capital and to incur  from time to time  additional bank indebtedness and if deemed necessary by management to obtain sba loans 
there can be no assurances that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability be recognized for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred 
it also requires that the initial measurement of a liability be at fair value 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which expands previously issued accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees 
the interpretation requires an entity to recognize an initial liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing a guarantee 
the provision for initial recognition and measurement of the liability will be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company does not expect this interpretation to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements as the company continues to apply the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 
in january the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this standard will require all variable interest entities vies to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the vies 
these requirements are effective for financial statements issued after january   and are not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for users to follow in classifying and measuring certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective for the first interim period after june  the company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s business activities contain elements of risk 
the company considers the principal types of risk to be fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio valuations 
the company considers the management of risk essential to conducting its businesses 
accordingly  the company s risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze the company s risks  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
the company values its portfolio at fair value as determined in good faith by the company s board of directors in accordance with the company s valuation policy 
unlike certain lending institutions  the company is not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the company must value each individual investment and portfolio loan on a quarterly basis 
the company records unrealized depreciation on investments and loans when it believes that an asset has been impaired and full collection is unlikely 
without a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of the company s portfolio of investments and loans may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if there existed a ready market for the investments 
the company adjusts the valuation of the portfolio quarterly to reflect the board of directors estimate of the current fair value of each investment in the portfolio 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the company s statement of operations as net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
in addition  the illiquidity of the our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments 
also  if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
because we borrow money to make loans and investments  our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we loan and invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income 
as interest rates rise  our interest costs increase  decreasing the net interest rate spread we receive and thereby adversely affect our profitability 
although we intend to continue to manage our interest rate risk through asset and liability management  including the use of interest rate swaps  general rises in interest rates will tend to reduce our interest rate spread in the short term
