the company receives allowances from certain vendors through a variety of arrangements 
given the promotional nature of the company s business  the allowances are generally intended to offset the company s costs of promoting  selling and advertising the vendors products 
vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the purpose for which the vendor funds were intended to be used has been fulfilled

the transitional disclosure requirements of fin no

fin will be effective for the company on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements in this interpretation have been adopted by the company 
the company does not expect this statement to have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
basis for presentation the consolidated statement of income and statement of cash flows for the year ended june  and the consolidated balance sheet as of june  include the combined operations of salton and amap  reflecting the additional ownership interest as previously discussed 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap require results for the other years presented  including results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal years ended june  and june  and the consolidated balance sheet as of june  be presented on a historical basis with salton s investment in amap accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
discussion of critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate these estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  reserve for inventory valuation  reserve for returns and allowances  valuation of reporting units with goodwill  valuation of intangible assets having indefinite lives  cooperative advertising accruals  pension benefits and depreciation and amortization 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may impact the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies required the most significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze such factors as our historical bad debt experiences  publicly available information regarding our customers and the inherent credit risk related to them  information from subscription based credit reporting companies  trade association data and reports  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms or payment patterns 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers were to worsen  additional write offs may be required  resulting in write offs that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at june  inventory valuation our inventories are generally determined using the last in  first out lifo cost method 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market  and regularly review the book value of discontinued product lines and stock keeping units skus to determine if these items are properly valued 
if market value is less than cost  we write down the related inventory to the lower of market or net realizable value 
we regularly evaluate the composition of our inventory to identify slow moving and obsolete inventories to determine if additional write offs are required 
changes in consumer purchasing patterns  however  could result in the need for additional write offs 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to lawsuits and other claims related to product and other matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business 
we maintain reserves and or accruals for such costs that may be incurred  which are determined on a case by case basis  taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes  as well as the potential range of probable loss 
the reserves and accruals are monitored on an ongoing basis and are updated for new developments or new information as appropriate 
intangible assets we record intangible assets through transactions and acquisitions 
the cost of acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
under current accounting guidelines that became effective on july   goodwill arising from transactions occurring after july  and any existing goodwill as of june  are not amortized to expense but rather periodically assessed for impairment 
intangible assets that have an indefinite life are also periodically assessed for impairment 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill therefore has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
further  when impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets  the values of the assets are determined using discounted future cash flow techniques  which are based on estimated future operating results 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected discounted cash flows 
as of june   the company prepared estimates of the fair values of those reporting units having recorded goodwill amounts 
such estimates exceeded the carrying values of the reporting units  however  shortfalls in future operating results and or application of more conservative market assumptions could have an adverse impact on the comparison of fair value to carrying value 
if these conditions arise  and a shortfall in fair value versus carrying value results  further analysis of intangibles at the unit level could result in an impairment charge of a material portion of the million of goodwill 
year in review salton faced a difficult year in the united states market with a labor lockout in the west coast ports  a disappointing holiday sales season at retail  overstocked retailers and a war driven economic environment 
despite these conditions  we were able to generate net income of million for the full year  reduce our indebtedness  net of cash  by million and reduce inventories to their lowest level since fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended june  june  june  net sales cost of goods sold distribution expenses gross profit selling  general and administrative expense lawsuit settlements  net impairment loss on intangible asset operating income compared to net sales and gross profit salton s net sales for were million 
this represented a decrease of compared to while overall sales in the domestic market decreased  our strong portfolio of brand names contributed to our success internationally 
we experienced significant volume decreases in the domestic market as a result of a disappointing holiday season at retail 
this left retailers overstocked during the third quarter of fiscal further depressing sales 
in addition  we experienced a decrease of approximately million in net sales attributable to domestic price reductions in an effort to gain long term market presence  an initiative to reduce domestic inventory levels and reduce the number of stock keeping units skus the company carries in inventory 
these actions occurred primarily in the second half of these decreases were offset by just over million in international sales increases primarily associated with the george foreman and russell hobbs brands  the inclusion of amap s sales for the period of may  through june  and the inclusion of a full year of sales under the look for acquisition  now renamed salton france 
gross profit in decreased to million or of net sales as compared to million or of net sales in primarily as a result of domestic price and volume reductions discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales or million in compared to of net sales or million for expenditures for television  royalty expense  certain other media and cooperative advertising and trade show expenses were of net sales or million in fiscal compared to of net sales or million in fiscal this decrease is primarily associated with a decline in infomercial advertising partially offset by an increase in direct advertising 
fair market value adjustment on derivatives salton europe uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  primarily us dollar inventory purchases 
the contracts generally mature within one year and are designed to limit exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
we recognized a pre tax benefit for an increase in the fair market value of the derivatives of million  or million net of tax  from foreign exchange contracts that did not qualify as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes in accordance with us gaap 
unrealized pre tax losses resulting from foreign exchange contracts that qualified as cash flow hedges were de minimis 
net interest expense net interest expense was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to lower average borrowings under the current and former revolver and term loan agreement and our repayment of certain other obligations existing in our rate of interest on amounts outstanding under the revolver  term loan and senior subordinated debt was a weighted average annual rate of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the average amount of all debt outstanding was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal income taxes the effective tax rate for federal  state and foreign income taxes were approximately in versus approximately in the company s income tax rate for was favorably impacted due to a disproportionately greater amount of income subject to lower foreign tax rates and a taxable loss in the domestic entities 
the company anticipates that in future years  its effective income tax rate will return to that of historical rates 
net income the company reported net income of million or basic earnings per common share of per share for the fiscal year compared with net income of million or basic earnings per common share of per share for the fiscal year net income for was primarily reduced by a pricing transition in the domestic market partially offset by expansion and internal growth in the international markets 
compared to net sales and gross profit salton s net sales for were million 
this represented an increase of compared to this increase is primarily attributable to increased sales of products under the george foreman  stiffel  toastmaster  aircore  farberware  melitta and other brands 
these increases in sales were partially offset by decreases in sales of products under the white westinghouse product line  primarily sold to kmart  as well as reductions primarily in sales of juiceman  salton  maxim and magic chef brands 
sales of new product lines  primarily under the westclox  spartus  big ben and look for brands and the addition of a full year of sales of product and brand names acquired in connection with salton europe  also helped offset the sales decreases 
much of the sales increase occurred in the second and fourth quarters of with particularly strong sales of products under the george foreman  toastmaster  stiffel and farberware brands  as well as strong sales of products and brand names acquired in connection with salton europe and westclox 
the fourth quarter of fiscal only included one month of results from salton europe 
gross profit in fiscal was million or of net sales as compared to million or of net sales in cost of goods sold during decreased to of net sales compared to in gross profit increased slightly  primarily from an increase in distribution expenses  million for reserve increases related to certain trade and royalty receivables and million associated with the exiting of certain product lines  offset by an improvement in sales of higher priced items with higher gross margins  particularly george foreman products  russell hobbs products and rejuvenique products and a reduction in sales of white westinghouse products which generally have lower gross margins 
gross profit for was reduced by million related to inventory losses  million in lifo charges and million related to trade receivables 
distribution expenses increased  as a percentage of sales  due to higher costs of operating our warehouses and increased outside warehouse space added during the year 
we consolidated three us west coast warehouses into a new leased facility completed in july additionally we incurred a full year of expenses in related to the operation of salton europe 
the increase was partially offset by a reduction in freight costs from changing certain customers from prepaid freight to collect freight during the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales or million in fiscal compared to of net sales or million for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses include a full year of salton europe or million compared to one month of salton europe or million in fiscal expenditures for television  royalty expense  certain other media and cooperative advertising and trade show expenses were of net sales or million in fiscal compared to of net sales or million in fiscal this increase was primarily from increased spending on cooperative advertising  direct advertising  royalty expenses and trade show expenses  partially offset by decreased spending on infomercial advertising 
these expenditures were driven primarily to penetrate new brands into the european market  and to increase sales in a promotionally driven domestic market 
the remaining selling  general and administrative costs increased to million or of net sales in fiscal compared to million or of net sales in fiscal this was primarily attributable to increased salaries  amortization on goodwill and other intangibles  increased legal and other professional expenses related to legal matters and a domestic corporate restructuring for improved reporting purposes  rent  travel  product development costs to support our sales activities  and increases in certain other administrative expenses to support the activities of the company 
the increases in salaries  product development and other administrative expense were primarily related to the integration of new or acquired product lines and businesses  and infrastructure and systems improvements 
fair market value adjustment on derivatives salton europe entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  primarily us dollar inventory purchases 
the contracts generally mature within one year and are designed to limit exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
we recognized a pre tax charge for a decrease in the fair market value of the derivatives of million  or million net of tax  from foreign exchange contracts that did not qualify as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes in accordance with us gaap 
unrealized pre tax losses of million or million net of tax  from foreign exchange contracts that qualified as cash flow hedges were included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the fair market value adjustment occurred primarily in the fourth quarter as the dollar weakened against the pound sterling 
net interest expense net interest expense was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to interest expense of million related to the million senior subordinated debt offering completed in april   interest expense of related to the accretion of the pifco loan notes and a reduction in interest income of million for funds kept on deposit during fiscal  partially offset by a reduction of interest paid of million on reduced borrowings under our revolver and term debt and lower rates during fiscal our rate of interest on amounts outstanding under the revolver  term loan and senior subordi nated debt was a weighted average annual rate of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the average amount of all debt outstanding was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal these increases contributed to higher interest expense and the increased borrowings were used to provide working capital necessary to support the business and make acquisitions 
net income the company reported net income of million or basic earnings per share of per share for the fiscal year compared with net income of million or basic earnings per share of per share for the fiscal year net income for declined as a result of increased selling  general and administrative expenses  million for certain bankruptcies  million for exiting certain product lines and million for legal settlements 
income tax expense salton had tax expense of million in fiscal as compared to tax expense of million in fiscal the overall tax rate for fiscal was of pretax income compared to in fiscal this reduction was primarily due to certain initiatives implemented in fiscal that reduced our state taxes and by the impact of certain legal settlements  which were not taxable 
liquidity and capital resources overview our primary sources of liquidity are our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
in  salton s operations provided million in cash flow  compared with million in this is primarily a result of generating cash through decreased inventories  decreases in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable 
given the seasonal nature of our business  borrowings and availability tend to be highest in mid fall and early winter 
our results of operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuation 
we generally negotiate our purchase orders with our foreign manufacturers in united states dollars 
thus  our cost under any purchase order is not subject to change after the time the order is placed due to exchange rate fluctuations 
however  the weakening of the united states dollar against local currencies could result in certain manufacturers increasing the united states dollar prices for future product purchases 
salton europe currently uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  primarily us dollar inventory purchases 
the contracts generally mature within one year and are designed to limit exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  primarily the british pound sterling against united states dollars 
we incurred approximately million for capital expenditures during fiscal revolving credit facility on may   we entered into a four year senior secured revolving credit facility which provides us with the ability to borrow up to million including million for letters of credit 
advances under the senior secured credit facility are primarily based upon percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
the credit agreement is secured by all of the tangible and intangible assets of our domestic entities and of the capital stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
as of june   we had borrowed under the senior secured revolving credit facility and had approximately million available under this facility for future borrowings with an additional million reserved for the final payments on the foreman notes 
subsequent to year end  we made the final installment payment to george foreman 
our senior indebtedness contains a number of significant covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  prepay other indebtedness  pay dividends  repurchase or redeem capital stock  enter into certain investments  enter into sale and lease back transactions  make certain acquisitions  engage in mergers and consolidations  create liens  or engage in certain transactions with affiliates and otherwise restrict our corporate and business activities 
in addition  under our senior secured revolving credit facility  we are required to comply with a minimum domestic and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 
in addition to the above  under the credit agreement  the company is required to maintain a minimum level of availability of million for the period july st december st and million for the period january st june th of any given year 
if the company fails to maintain these minimum availability levels  all proceeds from the sale of collateral including working capital shall be deposited for the benefit of the agent and released to the company at the discretion and consent of the required lenders 
no additional payments were required since the inception of the credit agreement and none were required in fiscal and pertaining to the previous revolving and term debt facilities 
borrowings under our senior secured credit facility accrue interest  at our option  at either libor  plus a specified margin  which is determined by our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  equaling at june   or the base rate wachovia bank s prime rate  plus a specified margin  which is determined by our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and is at june senior subordinated notes in addition to borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility  we had million of senior subordinated notes due outstanding and million of senior subordinated notes due outstanding excluding million related to the fair value of interest rate swap agreements that have been monetized 
the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes due and senior subordinated notes due contains  covenants that  among other things  limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  create certain liens  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and lease back transactions  sell assets or enter into certain mergers and consolidations 
other credit facilities we maintain credit facilities out of the united states that locally support our foreign subsidiaries operations and working capital requirements 
these facilities are at current market rates in those localities and at certain peak periods of the year  are secured by various assets 
commitments and contingencies to facilitate an understanding of the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments  the following data is provided payments due by period within after total year years years years in thousands long term debt     short term debt capital lease obligations  operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      amount of commitment expiration per period within after total year years years years in thousands legal settlements   import letters of credit   executive compensation    total commercial commitments    payments required under certain litigation and attorney generals settlement 
the attorney generals settlement requires us to make one additional payment of million on march  outstanding letters of credit for inventory purchases 
executive salaries and bonuses under employment agreements expiring in and forward looking we anticipate capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to be approximately of net sales 
we believe that future cash flow from operations based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth  together with our strengthened balance sheet and available borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility and other sources of debt funding  will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for current capital expenditures  potential acquisitions and alliances  working capital requirements  interest and income tax payments and scheduled debt payments 
our anticipated earnings and growth are subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures after satisfying certain liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business 
if unable to do so  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  including the notes  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be available or that any sales of assets or additional financing could be obtained 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk 
our objectives in managing our exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs through the use of interest rate swaps 
our objectives in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt  and hedge foreign currency commitments of future payments and receipts by purchasing foreign currency forward contracts 
the following tables provide information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
our major risk exposures are changing interest rates in the united states and foreign currency commitments in europe 
the fair values of our long term  fixed rate debt and foreign currency forward contracts were estimated based on dealer quotes 
the carrying amount of short term debt and long term variable rate debt approximates fair value 
all items described in the tables are non trading 
thereafter total fair value dollars in thousands fiscal year liabilities foreman note payable    average interest rate long term debt fixed rate amount     average interest rate variable rate amount    average interest rates thereafter total fair value dollars in thousands fiscal year liabilities revolver    average interest rate foreman note payable     average interest rate long term debt fixed rate amount     average interest rate variable rate amount      average interest rates the variable rate revolving credit facility is set periodically at an established base rate equivalent to the prime rate of interest or  at our election  a libor rate plus an applicable margin of basis points 
in fiscal and  we terminated various interest rate swap contracts on million notional amount of indebtedness resulting in gains from early termination 
these gains were deferred as adjustments to the carrying amount of the outstanding debt and are being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense related to the debt over the remaining period originally covered by the terminated swap 
the company did not have an interest rate swap agreement in effect as of june  the foreman note does not include an interest element 
the is the estimated interest rate used for calculating the net present value 
we use foreign currency forward contracts with terms of less than one year  to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in managing our foreign currency exposures  we identify and aggregate naturally occurring offsetting positions and then hedges residual balance sheet exposures 
at june   we had forward contracts outstanding for the purchase of million over the course of the next twelve months  which had an aggregate fair value of million
