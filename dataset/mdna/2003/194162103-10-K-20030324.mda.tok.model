dollars in millions except per share amounts restructuring reserves in december  the company recorded a charge of aftertax associated with the realignment of three manufacturing locations in latin america and the exiting of its business in nigeria 
the charge recorded included for termination costs and for exiting of manufacturing operations 
the restructuring was completed in managing foreign currency  interest rate and commodity price exposure the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity price fluctuations 
volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a consolidated basis by utilizing a number of techniques  including working capital management  selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into certain derivative instrument transactions in accordance with the company s treasury and risk management policies 
the company s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes 
with operations in over countries and territories  the company is exposed to currency fluctuation related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar 
the major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in the european union and certain latin american countries  although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the us dollar 
the company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets and has been able to substantially offset the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through a combination of cost containment measures  foreign currency hedging activities and selling price increases 
the company primarily utilizes currency forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business 
from time to time  the company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency purchases using forward contracts with durations no greater than months 
interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the company s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility 
the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production 
futures and option contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases 
the results of the company s commodity hedging activities are not material 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the company  however  nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the company s policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long term debt rating of a or higher 
value at risk the company s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows  market value and sensitivity analysis 
however  the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
market exposures are evaluated using a value at risk var model and an earnings at risk ear model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments  assuming adverse market conditions occur  given a confidence level 
the models utilize a variance covariance modeling technique 
dollars in millions except per share amounts historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates from the preceding year are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments  calculated using the var model  is not material to the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company in and the estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments  calculated utilizing the ear model  is not material to the company s results of operations in and actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets

critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates 
the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed 
actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management 
the company s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
in certain instances  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods 
the company s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options  shipping and handling costs  and inventories 
dollars in millions except per share amounts two alternative methods for accounting for stock options are available  the intrinsic value method and the fair value method 
the company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options  and accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized 
under the fair value method  the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option life and future volatility 
if the fair value method were used  diluted earnings per share for would decrease approximately 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company reports such costs  primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight  in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
if such costs were included in cost of sales  gross margin as a percent to sales would decrease from to in with no impact on reported earnings 
the company accounts for inventories using both the first in  first out fifo method of inventories and the last in  first out lifo method of inventories 
there would be no impact on reported earnings for  and if all inventories were accounted for under the fifo method 
the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits  asset impairment  tax valuation allowances  and legal and other contingencies 
in pension accounting  the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate for domestic plans was  and as of december   and  respectively 
as required  the discount rate is based upon published year end rates on high quality bonds 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for domestic plans was  and as of december   and  respectively 
this assumption is based on historical experience and long term expectations of asset performance 
a change in either the discount rate or the assumed return on plan assets would impact net income by approximately a third less significant assumption is the long term rate of compensation increase  a change in which  would partially offset the impact of a change in either of the above rates 
the most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate 
in  the assumed rate was for and declining per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of per year 
the effect of a increase in the assumed long term medical cost trend rate would reduce net income by approximately asset impairment analysis is primarily performed for intangible assets and requires several estimates including future cash flows  growth rates and the selection of a discount rate 
since the estimated fair value of the company s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value  significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge 
tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets  such as tax loss carryforwards  to net realizable value 
factors considered in estimating net realizable value include carryforward periods  income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income 
a significant change to the company s valuation allowances will not materially impact reported earnings 
legal and other contingency reserves are based on management s assessment of the risk of potential loss  which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors 
such assessments are reviewed each period and revised  based on current facts and circumstances  if necessary 
it is management s opinion that the ultimate disposition of these matters  to the extent not previously provided for  will not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or ongoing cash flows 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s contingencies 
the company generates revenue through the sale of well known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms 
while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates  there is a short time frame typically less than days between the shipment of product and cash receipt  thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company s significant accounting policies 
dollars in millions except per share amounts outlook looking forward into  the company is well positioned for continued growth in most of its markets 
however  the company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration 
in addition  movements in foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in us dollars 
in particular  economic uncertainty in some countries in latin america and changes in the value of the euro may impact the overall results of latin america and europe 
the company expects the continued success of colgate toothpaste  using patented and proprietary technology  to bolster worldwide oral care leadership and expects new products in oral care and other categories to add potential for further growth 
overall  subject to global economic conditions  the company does not expect the market conditions to be materially different from those experienced in and the company expects its positive momentum to continue 
historically  the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries 
therefore  the company constantly evaluates projects that will focus operations on opportunities for enhanced growth potential 
over the long term  colgate s continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names  its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets  and its strong capital base all position the company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to continue to increase profitability and shareholder value 
cautionary statement on forward looking statements in this report and from time to time  the company may make statements that constitute or contain forward looking information as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of or by the securities and exchange commission in its rules  regulations and releases 
such statements may relate  for example  to sales or volume growth  earnings growth  financial goals  cost reduction plans and new product introductions among other matters 
the company cautions investors that any such forward looking statements made by the company are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from anticipated results or expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
the following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements global economic conditions 
the company operates on a global basis  with approximately of its net sales coming from operations outside the us the company is subject to the full range of economic risks  including those associated with international operations  such as economic recession  inflation  access to capital markets and related costs  movements in currency exchange rates and interest rates  return on pension assets  trade restrictions  tax law changes  political and legal instability  the imposition of trade restrictions and similar factors beyond the control of the company 
competition 
the company faces vigorous competition from multinational consumer product companies throughout the world with the same or greater resources than the company 
such competition is based on pricing of products  promotional activities  advertising  new product introductions  electronic commerce initiatives and other activities of competitors  the timing and scale of which cannot be foreseen by the company 
the company s ability to compete also depends on the strength of its brands  its ability to attract and retain key talent  and its ability to protect its patent  trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors 
retail trade 
the company can be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers  such as inventory de stocking  limitations on access to shelf space  electronic data transmission requirements and other conditions 
with the growing trend towards retail trade consolidation  especially in developed markets such as the us and europe  the company is increasingly dependent on key retailers  and these retailers have increasingly greater bargaining strength 
in addition  private label brands sold by retail trade chains are becoming a source of competition for certain product lines of the company 
dollars in millions except per share amounts products 
the company s growth depends on the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions  which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors  as well as the continued success of existing products 
in addition  the company s ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by its ability to develop technological innovations  to receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and regulatory approvals  and to anticipate successfully consumer needs and preferences 
cost pressures 
the company s ability to manage its cost structure can be adversely affected by movements in raw material prices and by unanticipated delays or difficulties in achieving cost efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution 
in addition  the company s move to global suppliers  to achieve cost reductions and simplify its business  has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers 
for certain materials  new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry and government standards  which can require additional investment and take some period of time 
manufacturing 
as a company engaged in manufacturing on a global scale  the company is subject to the risks inherent in such activities  including industrial accidents  environmental events  strikes and other labor disputes  loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites  product quality and safety issues  natural disasters and other external factors over which the company has no control
