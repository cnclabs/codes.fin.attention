item legal proceedings on march   e s received notice from realvision  inc of a dispute involving a transaction between the companies in and this transaction was the sale of assets of realimage to realvision  and the provision of services between the companies 
in accordance with the contract  realvision has called for negotiation to resolve the issues  and mediation if necessary  as defined under the contract 
further  realvision has threatened legal action if agreement is not reached 
e s strongly disagrees with statements made by realvision in its complaint  and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously  whether in negotiation  mediation  or by legal process  including possible legal action against realvision

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of e s s financial statements 
their application places significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future results rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition revenue from long term contracts requiring significant production  modification or customization is recorded using the percentage of completion method 
this method uses the ratio of costs incurred to management s estimate of total anticipated costs 
our estimates of total costs include assumptions  such as man hours to complete  estimated materials cost  and estimates of other direct and indirect costs 
actual results may vary significantly from our estimates 
if the actual costs are higher than management s anticipated total costs  then an adjustment would be required to reduce the previously recognized revenue as the ratio of costs incurred to management s estimate was overstated 
if actual costs are lower than management s anticipated total costs  then an adjustment would be required to increase the previously recognized revenue as the ratio of costs incurred to management s estimate is understated 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts billings on uncompleted long term contracts may be greater than or less than incurred costs and estimated earnings 
as a result  these differences are recorded as an asset or liability on the balance sheets 
since revenue recognized on these long term contracts includes estimates of management s anticipated total costs  the amounts in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts also include these estimates 
inventories inventory includes materials at standard costs  which approximates average costs  as well as inventoried costs on programs including material  labor  subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
we periodically review inventories for excess supply  obsolescence  and valuations above estimated realizable amounts  and then provide a reserve we consider sufficient to cover these items 
reserve adequacy is based on estimates of future sales  product pricing  and requirements to complete projects 
revisions of these estimates would result in adjustments to our operating results 
accrued expenses accrued expenses include amounts for liquidated damages and late delivery penalties see note to the consolidated financial statements 
while current contracts could include additional liquidated damages and late delivery penalties  we have included all amounts management believes e s is liable for as of december  these liquidated damages are based primarily on estimates of project completion dates 
to the extent completion dates are not consistent with our estimates  these damage and penalty accruals may require additional adjustments 
allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we specifically analyze accounts receivables and consider historic experience  customer creditworthiness  facts and circumstances specific to outstanding balances  current economic trends  and payment term changes when evaluating adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in these factors could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for bad debts 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our actual income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items  such as accrued liabilities  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  we must include a corresponding adjustment within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
results of operations the following discussions should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained herein under item of this annual report 
year ended december  sales cost of sales inventory impairment gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development restructuring charge impairment loss realimage transition costs operating expenses gain on curtailment of pension plan gain on sale of assets held for sale gain on sale of business unit operating loss other income expense  net loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss accretion of preferred stock net loss applicable to common stock consolidated sales and gross profit our total sales were million in  compared with million in and million in military sales declined in compared to because contained a large amount of revenue from six large programs big programs  which are now  on average  complete 
no new programs of this size were awarded during to produce replacement revenue 
sales of our pc based image generator declined in compared to because our next generation simfusion product was not launched until the third quarter of and customers were waiting for the release of this enhanced pc based image generator 
the new simfusion product generated orders and revenue in the third and fourth quarters of in  sales of our planetarium systems declined as customers delayed their orders of existing products in anticipation of our next generation products  which have now been launched and are also producing orders and revenue 
sales were also impacted by a worldwide slowdown of demand for planetarium equipment in in  we also sold our realimage business and discontinued the operations of our rapidsite business  therefore  losing related revenue in these decreases in sales were partially offset by an increase in service and support revenues 
both commercial and military markets have been changing rapidly during the past year  and continue to do so 
in the commercial market  commercial airlines have reduced purchases of new aircraft compared to prior years 
this has resulted in a reduction in the number of new simulators they require for training 
however  many commercial airlines are upgrading their currently installed simulators 
as a result  we have benefited from this change because e s has a large share of the installed base of visual systems and because our newly introduced ep ct product provides an attractive upgrade path due to its compatibility with the installed base 
military markets have continued to shrink as funds are diverted to more pressing military requirements 
we believe this process of diverting funds will continue during  but may result in some pent up demand in our sales declined compared to as a result of both delays in military programs relating to our harmony image generator and a decline in sales volume to commercial airline customers 
sales in the realimage business also declined in as the group was sold during the third quarter of additionally  sales of planetarium systems also declined in these declines more than offset increases in the sales volumes of our simfusion pc based image generator and service and support revenues 
our gross margin percentages were in  compared with in  and in gross margins increased significantly as a result of the big programs  which used our harmony image generator  having less of a negative impact in than in these six programs heavily contributed either losses or small positive gross margins to s overall gross profit 
additionally  gross margins on sales to commercial airline customers were up as included both positive adjustments for completing programs below cost estimates and improved overall cost performance 
these gross margin improvements were offset by an inventory impairment loss of million related to our restructuring plan decision to exit the simfusion product line 
the million charge encompassed the total value for the simfusion inventory on hand 
we took this impairment write off because we anticipate reduced demand for simfusion products as a result of customer migration to the next generation simfusion products 
our gross margin percentage increased compared to as a result of higher sales volumes and lower cost of sales for support services and improved cost performance on sales to commercial airline customers 
additionally  gross margins on our planetarium systems increased as a result of improved overall cost performance 
these improvements were partially offset by higher cost of sales on simfusion pc based image generators and cost overruns on our harmony image generator programs 
operating expenses  other and taxes our operating expenses were million in  compared with million in and million in selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses decreased million during as a result of lower headcount  lower labor costs  reduced use of consultants  and lower overheads 
additionally  due to improved collection experience  previous bad debt accruals of million were reversed  which lowered sg a expenses 
research and development expenses decreased million in as a result of lower headcount  decreased effort on our integrator software product as it nears completion  and reduced overhead costs 
these r d decreases were partly offset by one time material purchases for the development of both our ep line of new visual systems for commercial simulation and our new pc based products 
our sg a expenses decreased million in compared to as a result of lower headcount  reduced incentive expenses  lower commissions on reduced orders  and lower advertising expenditures 
additionally  sg a savings were achieved when the realimage business was sold 
research and development costs decreased million in  compared to  as a result of lower labor and related expenses as a result of the reduced development effort on our harmony  integrator  ensemble  and pc based simulation products 
additionally  r d savings were achieved when the realimage business was sold and the rapidsite business was discontinued 
during we recorded a charge of million for realimage transition costs that included all expenses associated with the realimage solutions group incurred in the first three quarters of there were no realimage transition costs in or during  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to a reduction in force of approximately employees in an attempt to reduce the operating cost structure as well as to create a cost structure in line with anticipated revenues 
we estimate that this restructuring will reduce expenses by approximately million per year going forward 
during  we recorded a restructuring charge of million relating to a reduction in force of approximately employees 
in  we reversed million of a million restructuring charge as a result of employee transfers within e s rather than termination and lower than estimated severance costs 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized an impairment loss of million on software licenses related to software licenses that were used by employees removed in the fourth quarter reduction in force actions 
during  we recognized an impairment loss of million related to the write off of goodwill acquired in the e s acquisition of accelgraphics  inc and silicon reality  inc 
in no impairment losses were recorded in during  we recognized a gain on the curtailment of our pension plan of million 
in order to both match current market practices and improve our competitive position  the pension plan was amended to curtail accrual of future benefits 
at the same time  the e s k plan was amended to permit the board of directors to grant additional discretionary matching contributions based on profitability as well as other financial and operational considerations 
during  we recognized a gain on assets held for sale of million on the sale of a building 
in we also recognized an additional million gain on the sale of a business unit on the sale of the realimage solutions group  which was originally sold in  due to favorable cost performance compared to the original cost estimates 
during  we recognized a gain on the sale of assets held for sale of million due to the sale of certain d graphics patents and a gain on the sale of a business unit of million as a result of the sale of our realimage solutions group 
during  we recognized a gain on the sale of a business unit of million due to the sale of certain assets relating to our digital video business 
our other income expense was million in net expenses in  million in net expense in  and million in net expense in interest expense decreased to million in from million in due to lower debt levels 
interest expense increased to million in from million in due to higher debt levels 
also included in was million in gain on sale of investment securities and a million loss on the write down of investment securities 
the majority of these amounts related to the sale of our shares of silicon light machines  inc to cypress semiconductor  inc 
cypress for shares in cypress  and the subsequent fall in value and sale of those cypress shares 
our income tax benefits were million in compared to million in and compared to an income tax expense of million in the income tax benefit was the result of a change in the us tax law  which allows us to use additional net operating losses to offset taxable income 
the benefit in was primarily due to the favorable audit resolution of certain potential foreign tax liabilities 
the income tax expense in was the result of a million increase in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a result of the cancellation of a significant contract and continued pretax losses 
liquidity and capital resources general overview during  we made strides to improve our liquidity and capital resources position 
the near completion of the big programs during had a positive impact on our liquidity 
our operations generated million in cash in  which we used to reduce our lines of credit 
at december   our maximum borrowings and letters of credit allowed under our lines of credit were approximately million  with actual borrowings from our lines of credit  short and long term  of million 
we sold one of our buildings in and will continue to market the remaining two buildings for sale in at december   we had cash and restricted cash of million and we have approximately million in long term convertible subordinated debentures due in big impact we have six harmony programs big that have had a negative impact on our overall financial condition during and however  by achieving  on average  a completion rate on the big programs  we believe we have mitigated future potential negative effects the big programs could have on our future financial condition 
in  approximately million in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts relating to the big programs were converted to accounts receivable 
our collections on related accounts receivables during were approximately million 
collections on accounts receivable have significantly contributed to million in cash generated from operations during with the generation of this cash from operations  we were less reliant on our lines of credit as the year progressed 
cash flow at december   we had working capital of million  including cash and restricted cash of million  compared to working capital of million at december   including cash and restricted cash of million 
during  we generated million from our operating activities  used million in our investing activities  and used million in our financing activities 
cash from our operating activities was provided by an million decrease in the net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts decreased million primarily due to successful near completion of the big programs 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts decreased million due primarily to million in deliveries made in related to commercial simulation orders booked in and million in deliveries made in related to military simulation orders in also contributing to cash from operations was an million decrease in accounts receivable due primarily to collections on the big programs and improved collections 
cash used by investing activities was million 
purchases of property  plant and equipment used million cash in  however this was offset by million from the sale of one of our buildings 
over the past two years  we have significantly reduced our investment in property  plant and equipment as part of our cost reduction plan associated with our restructuring efforts 
in   and we invested million  million  and million  respectively 
cash used by our financing activities was million in  compared to cash generation of million in in  cash generation from financing activities was due mainly to our reliance on lines of credit to fund our working capital 
in  as a result of cash generation from our operating activities  we were less reliant on our lines of credit 
thus  we were able to pay them down and our average borrowings against our lines of credit were lower in credit facilities in december  we entered into a secured credit facility the foothill facility with foothill capital corporation foothill that provided for borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit up to million 
in december  e s and foothill renegotiated and renewed the terms of the foothill facility  providing for borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit up to million 
the foothill facility  among other things  i requires e s to maintain certain financial ratios and covenants  including a minimum tangible net worth that adjusts each quarter  a minimum unbilled receivables to billed receivables ratio  and a limitation of million of aggregate capital expenditures in any fiscal year  ii restricts our ability to incur debt or liens  sell  assign  pledge or lease assets  merge with another company  and iii restricts the payment of dividends and repurchase of any of our outstanding shares without the prior consent of the lender 
the foothill facility expires in december borrowings under the foothill facility bear interest at the wells fargo bank national association prevailing prime rate plus to  depending on the amount outstanding 
in addition  the foothill facility has an unused line fee equal to per annum times the difference between million and the sum of the average undrawn portion of the borrowings  payable each quarter 
the foothill facility provides foothill with a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of our assets  including  but not limited to  all of our intellectual property 
pursuant to the terms of the foothill facility  all cash receipts of e s must be deposited into a foothill controlled account 
due to foothill s waiver on february  of e s s noncompliance with financial covenants through december  and the modification of the financial covenants  foothill s waiver on july  of e s s noncompliance with financial covenants in the second quarter of  and the january  amendment to the financial covenants effective in december  we were in compliance with our financial covenants and ratios as of december  however  a continuation of trends from   and portions of  could impact future compliance with such covenants 
as of december   we had outstanding financial standby letters of credit totaling million related to our performance on certain customer contracts 
our customers can draw against these letters of credit if we fail to meet the performance requirements contained within the terms of each letter of credit 
as of december   no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses under these obligations  as it is probable that we will perform as required under our contracts 
as of december   we had million in outstanding borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit under the foothill facility 
evans sutherland computer limited  a wholly owned subsidiary of evans sutherland computer corporation  has a million overdraft facility the overdraft facility with lloyds tsb bank plc lloyds 
borrowings under the overdraft facility bear interest at lloyds short term offered rate plus per annum 
as of december   there were million in outstanding borrowings 
lloyds allows e s to borrow over million on the overdraft facility on condition that any borrowings over million are deposited with lloyds 
the overdraft facility is subject to reduction or demand repayment for any reason at any time at lloyds discretion 
as a result of a recent renewal of the overdraft facility  it now expires on december  evans sutherland computer limited executed a letter of negative pledge in favor of lloyds whereby it agreed not to sell or encumber its assets  except in the ordinary course of business 
covenants contained in the overdraft facility restrict dividend payments from evans sutherland computer limited and require maintenance of certain financial covenants 
in addition  at december   we had million in restricted cash deposited at lloyds related to the overdraft facility  million of this cash on deposit is in a restricted cash collateral account to support certain obligations that the bank guarantees and borrowings were million 
as of february   we had million in outstanding borrowings against the overdraft facility 
other in july  we formed a joint venture with quadrant group plc quadrant known as quest flight training limited quest 
quest provides certain equipment  software  training and other goods and services to the secretary of state for defence of the uk ministry of defence uk mod and other related governmental entities with regard to an upgrade of the uk mod ed facility and ed sentry aircrew training services 
in connection with the services of quest to the uk mod  we guaranteed various obligations of quest 
as of december   we had four guarantees outstanding related to quest 
one guarantees  jointly and severally with quadrant  the performance of quest in relation to its contract with the uk mod 
if quest fails to meet its obligations under the contract then we and quadrant are required to perform under the terms of the contract 
due to the length of the contract and the uncertainty of what performance we would be liable for if quest did in fact fail to perform  we cannot estimate the maximum amount of possible future payments 
this guarantee is in place until the second guarantees  jointly and severally with quadrant  up to a maximum amount of million million  the performance of quest  where not subcontracted  and the performance of quest where any subcontractor is not liable to meet its obligation due to any limitation of liability in its sub contract agreement and thus prevents quest from meeting its obligation under its contract with the uk mod 
this guarantee is in place until the third guarantees payment and discharge of a certain loan agreement  severally with quadrant  that quest has entered into 
as of december   the outstanding loan balance was million 
this guarantee is in place until the fourth guarantees a payment  up to a maximum amount of million million  in the event that quest has a default event  as defined by its loan agreement 
this guarantee is in place until as of december   no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses under these guarantees because we believe that quest will meet all of its performance and financial obligations in relation to its contract with the uk mod 
as of december   we had approximately million of convertible subordinated debentures due in the debentures 
the debentures are unsecured and are convertible at each bondholder s option into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of or  shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment 
the debentures are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at par 
on february   e s s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock  including the  shares still available from the repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors on november  on september   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares of our common stock 
on february    shares remained available for repurchase 
no shares were repurchased during   or stock may be acquired on the open market or through negotiated transactions 
under the program  repurchases may be made from time to time  depending on market conditions  share price and other factors 
the foothill facility requires that we obtain prior consent from foothill before we repurchase any shares 
we also maintain trade credit arrangements with certain of our suppliers 
the unavailability of a significant portion of  or the loss of  the various borrowing facilities of e s or trade credit from suppliers would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
in the event our various borrowing facilities were to become unavailable  we were unable to make timely deliveries of products pursuant to the terms of various agreements with third parties  or certain of our contracts were adversely impacted for failure to meet delivery requirements  we may be unable to meet our anticipated working capital needs  routine capital expenditures  and current debt service obligations on a short term and long term basis 
we believe that the principal sources of liquidity for will be a result of positive cash flows from the restructuring which has taken place  the progress to date on our harmony image generator fixed price contracts big programs  other cost cutting measures which will be implemented during and the sale of the two remaining buildings designated as assets held for sale 
circumstances that could materially affect liquidity in include  but are not limited to  the following i our ability to meet contractual milestones related to the delivery and integration of our harmony image generators  ii our ability to successfully develop and produce new technologies and products  iii our ability to meet our forecasted sales levels during  iv our ability to reduce costs and expenses  v our ability to maintain our commercial simulation business in light of current economic conditions and vi our ability to favorably negotiate sale agreements related to certain of our buildings 
we believe that existing cash  restricted cash  borrowings available under our various borrowing facilities  the sale of certain buildings currently held for sale  and expected cash from future operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital needs  routine capital expenditures and current debt service obligations for the next twelve months 
at december   our total indebtedness was million 
the foothill facility expires in december and the overdraft facility expires on december  if these credit facilities continue to be needed  we will attempt to replace them  however  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in renegotiating our existing borrowing facilities or obtaining additional debt or equity financing 
our cash and restricted cash  subject to various restrictions previously set forth  are available for working capital needs  capital expenditures  strategic investments  mergers and acquisitions  stock repurchases and other potential cash needs as they may arise 
effects of inflation the effects of inflation were not considered material during fiscal years  and  and are not expected to be material for fiscal year outlook our projections for the future look promising 
with the big programs essentially complete  the outlook for e s has greatly improved 
losses of approximately million  million  and million for  and  respectively  are  in large part  attributable to these programs  or actions related to them 
as revenues for these programs decreased as a percent of total sales during this period  our gross margins improved 
gross margin performance in was at a low of 
performance in improved to yield a gross margin in excess of 
this improvement is directly attributable to two key factors 
first  our core business  outside of the big programs  has a sustainable business model 
second  customers agree that our products bring additional value to their training capabilities 
the future success of e s is highly dependant on our products 
ep  harmony  simfusion  digistar  integrator and escp ii have been developed and or upgraded during the last two years as a result of significant research and development funding 
these new products have made a statement in the simulation marketplace  e s continues to be the technical leader in this space 
while revenues for e s are down due to the overall decline in the market  revenues from the commercial market have picked up by taking market share as a direct result of the technical advantages of ep management believes that as the market rebounds  we are uniquely positioned  via our new products  to see similar results in all of our business units 
forward looking statements the foregoing contains forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act of  as amended  including  among others  those statements preceded by  followed by or including the words estimates  believes  expects  anticipates  plans  projects  and similar expressions 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the following statements as a result  we believe this process of diverting funds during will result in some pent up demand for orders 
faa level d and equivalent certification anticipated for early we believe we are able to compete effectively in this environment and will continue to be able to do so in the foreseeable future 
management believes that the new line of e s products introduced in  as described above  will allow us to retain our industry leading position in the marketplace 
we anticipate that approximately two thirds of the backlog will be converted to sales in we actively pursue patents on our new technology and we intend to vigorously protect our patent rights 
we routinely copyright software  documentation  and chip masks designed by us and institute copyright registration for such software  documentation  and masks when appropriate 
we anticipate that high levels of research and development will be needed to continue to ensure that we maintain technical excellence  leadership  and market competitiveness 
the completion of these products will allow us to focus on the timely development of new products and additional product enhancements in we believe that any inherent risk that exists in our foreign operations is not material 
it is anticipated that this philosophy will continue in  and agreements will be continued or consummated as necessary to maintain our industry leading position 
we will continue to operate in germany and throughout europe under our own name  providing marketing  sales  and support for our growing visual systems business and traditional customer base 
we estimate that these restructurings will reduce expenses by approximately million per year going forward 
these restructurings were undertaken to reduce our operating cost structure as well as to create a cost structure in line with anticipated revenues 
we plan to sell the two buildings we do not occupy 
we sold one of our buildings in and will continue to market the remaining two buildings for sale in we believe that these properties are suitable for our immediate needs and we do not currently plan to expand our facilities or relocate 
although the final outcome of such matters cannot be predicted  we believe the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  liquidity or results of operations we intend for the foreseeable future to continue the policy of retaining our earnings to finance the development and growth of our business 
we took this impairment write off because we anticipate reduced demand for simfusion products as a result of customer migration to the next generation simfusion products 
however  by achieving  on average  a completion rate on the big programs  we believe we have mitigated future potential negative effects the big programs could have on our future financial condition 
as of december   no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses under these guarantees because we believe that quest will meet all of its performance and financial obligations in relation to its contract with the uk mod 
however  a continuation of trends from   and portions of  could impact future compliance with such covenants 
as of december   no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses under these obligations  as it is probable that we will perform as required under our contracts 
we believe that the principal sources of liquidity for will be a result of positive cash flows from the restructuring which has taken place  the progress to date on our harmony image generator fixed price contracts big programs  other cost cutting measures which will be implemented during and the sale of the two remaining buildings designated as assets held for sale 
we believe that existing cash  restricted cash  borrowings available under our various borrowing facilities  the sale of certain buildings currently held for sale  and expected cash from future operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital needs  routine capital expenditures and current debt service obligations for the next twelve months 
our projections for the future look promising 
with the big programs essentially complete  the outlook for e s is greatly improved 
the future success of e s is highly dependant on our products 
management believes that as the market rebounds  we are uniquely positioned  via our new products  to see similar results in all of our business units 
we have developed a rich set of tools to make the development of databases more efficient and less costly  whether built by e s or by others 
specifically  we continue to design and build complex integrated circuits chips where required  and we are the only company in the industry with this capability 
in the long term  we anticipate growth in the military market as new vehicles come on line and the overall cost effectiveness of simulation training makes it an increasingly attractive alternative to other training methods 
e s supplies very popular visual systems for commercial full flight simulators  providing what we estimate to be over of the visual systems installed in full flight training simulators for commercial airlines  training centers  simulator manufacturers  and aircraft manufacturers 
the effects of inflation were not considered material during fiscal years  and  and are not expected to be material for fiscal year under our current competitive strategy  we endeavor to remain competitive by growing existing businesses  developing new businesses internally  selectively acquiring businesses  increasing efficiency  improving access to new markets  and reducing costs 
based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth  management believes that available cash flow  together with available credit  will be adequate to meet our financial needs 
we currently make and plan to continue to make a significant investment in research and development 
while we have every reason to believe these investments will be rewarded with sales generating products  customer acceptance ultimately dictates the success of development and marketing efforts 
although we cannot predict such uncertainties  in our opinion there are no spending reductions or funding limitations pending that would impact our contracts 
we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales in the foreseeable future 
we intend to consider acquisitions  alliances  and transactions involving other companies that could complement our existing business 
while current contracts could include additional liquidated damages and late delivery penalties  we have included all amounts management believes e s is liable for as of december  assumptions relating to the foregoing 
forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which cannot be predicted or quantified 
future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by  or underlying the forward looking information 
our actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
in addition to the other risks described in the factors that may affect future results discussion under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report  important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include risk of product demand  market acceptance  economic conditions  competitive products and pricing  difficulties in product development  product delays  commercialization and technology  and our ability to maintain credit facilities to support our operations on favorable and acceptable terms 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  there can be no assurance that the events contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report will  in fact  occur 
factors that may affect future results our domestic and international businesses operate in highly competitive markets that involve a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
while we are optimistic about our long term prospects  the following discussion highlights some risks and uncertainties that should be considered in evaluating our growth outlook 
our stock price may be adversely impacted if our sales or earnings fail to meet expectations our stock price is subject to significant volatility and will likely be adversely affected if sales or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations 
our sales and earnings may fail to meet expectations because they fluctuate and are difficult to predict 
our earnings during and fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter 
one of the reasons we experience such fluctuations is that the largest share of our sales and earnings is from customer programs that typically have long delivery cycles and contract lengths 
the timing of customer acceptance of certain large scale commercial or government contracts may affect the timing and amount of sales that can be recognized  thus  causing our periodic operating results to fluctuate 
our results may further fluctuate if united states and international governments delay or even cancel production on large scale contracts due to lack of available funding 
our earnings may not meet either investor or internal expectations because our budgeted operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term and even a small sales shortfall may cause a period s results to be below expectations 
such a sales shortfall could arise from any number of factors  including delays in the availability of products  delays from chip suppliers  discontinuance of key components from suppliers  other supply constraints  transit interruptions  overall economic conditions  and customer demand 
another reason our earnings may not meet expectations is that our gross margins are heavily influenced by mix considerations 
these mix considerations include the mix of lower margin prime contracts versus sub contracts  the mix of new products and markets versus established products and markets  the mix of high end products versus low end products  as well as the mix of configurations within these product categories 
future margins may not duplicate historical margins or growth rates 
future losses could impair our ability to raise capital or borrow money and consequently affect our stock price although we recorded net sales of million for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million in we have incurred net losses totaling million over the past five years 
we cannot assure that we will be profitable in future periods 
losses in future periods could impair our ability to raise additional capital or borrow money as needed  could decrease our stock price and could cause a violation of certain covenants in our credit facilities 
our business may suffer if our competitive strategy is not successful our continued success depends on our ability to compete in an industry that is highly competitive  with rapid technological advances and constantly improving products in both price and performance 
in most market areas in which we operate we are experiencing increased competition  and we expect this trend to continue 
in recent years  we have been forced to adapt to domestic and worldwide political  economic  and technological developments that have strongly affected our markets 
under our current competitive strategy  we endeavor to remain competitive by growing existing businesses  developing new businesses internally  selectively acquiring businesses  increasing efficiency  improving access to new markets  and reducing costs 
although our executive management team and board of directors continue to review and monitor our strategic plans  we have no assurance that we will be able to continue to follow our current strategy or that this strategy will be successful 
our significant debt could adversely affect our financial resources and prevent us from satisfying our debt service obligations we have a significant amount of indebtedness and may also incur additional indebtedness in the future 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or have future borrowings available to us  sufficient to pay our debt 
at december   our total indebtedness was million and our total stockholders equity was million 
our ability to make debt payments or refinance our indebtedness depends on future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth  management believes that available cash flow  together with available credit  will be adequate to meet our financial needs 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts or to make necessary capital expenditures  or that any refinancing of debt would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including  but not limited to  the following the ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  or other purposes may be impaired or unavailable  a portion of cash flow will be used to pay interest expense  which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities  a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows or an increase in expenses could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements and force us to modify operations  we may be more highly leveraged than our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  our substantial indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or in the economy generally  and some of our existing debt contains financial and restrictive covenants that limit our ability to  among other things  borrow additional funds  acquire and dispose of assets  and pay cash dividends 
a portion of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at variable rates 
any increase in interest rates will reduce funds available to us for our operations and future business opportunities and will exacerbate the consequences of our leveraged capital structure 
covenants and restrictions in our credit documents limit our ability to take certain actions our credit documents contain significant financial and operating covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters 
these covenants include  among others  restrictions on our ability to declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock  incur certain additional debt  grant liens  make certain payments and investments  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  and consolidate with other entities 
we must also meet certain financial ratios and tests  including a minimum tangible net worth that adjusts each quarter  an unbilled receivables to billed receivables ratio  and a limitation of million of aggregate capital expenditures in any fiscal year 
failure to comply with the obligations contained in the credit documents could result in an event of default  and possibly the acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing debt that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
due to foothill s waiver on february  of e s s noncompliance with financial covenants through december  and the modification of the financial covenants  foothills waiver on july  of e s s noncompliance with financial covenants in the second quarter of  and the january  amendment to the financial covenants effective in december  we were in compliance with our financial covenants and ratios as of december  however  a continuation of trends from   and portions of  could impact our future compliance with such covenants 
should the need arise  we will negotiate with our lenders to modify and expand various financial covenants  however  no assurance can be given that such negotiations will result in modifications that will allow us to continue to be in compliance or otherwise be acceptable to us 
failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our name recognition efforts and ability to compete effectively currently  we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights and common law safeguards including trade secret protection 
to protect our intellectual property rights in the future  we intend to continue to rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights and common law safeguards  including trade secret protection 
we also rely on restrictions on use  confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements with our employees  affiliates  customers  alliance partners and others 
the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary information 
a third party could obtain our proprietary information or develop products or technology competitive with ours 
we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services to the same extent as in the united states 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm or even destroy our brands and impair our ability to compete effectively 
further  enforcing our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and may not prove successful 
delays in the timely delivery of our products may prevent us from invoicing our costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
in accordance with accounting for long term contracts  we record an asset for our costs and estimated earnings that exceed the amount we are able to bill our customers on uncompleted contracts 
at december   million of our costs and estimated earnings that exceed our billings on uncompleted contracts related to four contracts with three different customers 
we are not able to bill these amounts unless we meet certain contractual milestones related to the delivery and integration of our harmony and esig image generators 
our failure to achieve these contractual milestones by timely delivering and integrating our harmony and esig image generators may significantly impact our ability to recover our costs and estimated earnings that exceeded our billings on uncompleted contracts  which could severely impact our cash flow 
our significant investment in research and development may not be realized we have no assurance that our significant investment in research and development will generate future sales or benefits 
we currently make and plan to continue to make a significant investment in research and development 
total spending for research and development was million or of sales in as compared to million or of sales in developing new products and software is expensive and often involves a long payback cycle 
while we have every reason to believe these investments will be rewarded with sales generating products  customer acceptance ultimately dictates the success of development and marketing efforts 
we may not continue to be successful if we are unable to develop  produce and transition our products our continued success depends on our ability to develop  produce and transition technologically complex and innovative products that meet customer needs 
we have no assurance that we will be able to successfully continue such development  production and transition 
the development of new technologies and products is increasingly complex and expensive  which among other risks  increases the risk of product introduction delays 
the introduction of a new product requires close collaboration and continued technological advancement involving multiple hardware and software design and manufacturing teams within e s as well as teams at outside suppliers of key components 
the failure of any one of these elements could cause our new products to fail to meet specifications or to miss the aggressive timetables that we establish and the market demands 
as the variety and complexity of our product families increase  the process of planning and managing production  inventory levels  and delivery schedules also becomes increasingly complex 
there is no assurance that acceptance of and demand for our new products will not be affected by delays in this process 
additionally  if we are unable to meet our delivery schedules  we may be subject to the penalties  including liquidated damages that are included in some of our customer contracts  and termination of our contracts 
product transitions are a recurring part of our business 
our short product life cycles require our ability to successfully manage the timely transition from current products to new products 
in fact  it is not unusual for us to announce a new product while its predecessor is still in the final stages of its development 
our transition results could be adversely affected by such factors as development delays  late release of products to manufacturing  quality or yield problems experienced by production or suppliers  variations in product costs  excess inventories of older products and components  and delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of the introduction of new products 
in the event we suffer further product delays  we may be required to pay certain customers substantial liquidated damages and other penalties the variety and complexity of our high technology product lines require us to deal with suppliers and subcontractors supplying highly specialized parts  operating highly sophisticated and narrow tolerance equipment in performing highly technical calculations 
the processes of planning and managing production  inventory levels and delivery schedules are also highly complex and specialized 
many of our products must be custom designed and manufactured  which is not only complicated and expensive  but can also require a number of months to accomplish 
slight errors in design  planning and managing production  inventory levels  delivery schedules  or manufacturing can result in unsatisfactory products that may not be correctable 
if we are unable to meet our delivery schedules  we may be subject to penalties  including liquidated damages that are included in some of our customer contracts 
as of december   we had paid million in connection with liquidated damages 
during  we accrued an additional million for late delivery penalties 
during we accrued million to cover penalties  against which we paid million 
in  we also accrued million to cover additional costs incurred by customers  of which we paid million in in  we also accrued an additional million to cover additional costs incurred by customers 
although we did not have any liquidated damages in  there is no assurance that we may not incur substantial liquidated damages in the future in connection with further product delays 
we may not maintain a significant portion of our sales if we fail to maintain our united states government contracts in  of our sales were to agencies of the united states government  either directly or through prime contractors or subcontractors  for which there is intense competition 
accordingly  we have no assurance that we will be able to maintain a significant portion of our sales 
these sales are subject to the inherent risks related to government contracts  including uncertainty of economic conditions  changes in government policies and requirements that may reflect rapidly changing military and political developments  and unavailability of funds 
these risks also include technological uncertainties and obsolescence  and dependence on annual congressional appropriation and allotment of funds 
in the past  some of our programs have been delayed  curtailed  or terminated 
although we cannot predict such uncertainties  in our opinion there are no spending reductions or funding limitations pending that would impact our contracts 
other characteristics of the government contract market that may affect our operating results include the complexity of designs  the difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work  and the speed with which product lines become obsolete due to technological advances and other factors characteristic of the market 
our earnings may vary materially on some contracts depending upon the types of government long term contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  and the achievement of other performance objectives 
furthermore  due to the intense competition for available united states government business  maintaining or expanding government business increasingly requires us to commit additional working capital for long term programs and additional investments in company funded research and development 
our dependence on government contracts may lead to other perils as well because as a united states government contractor or sub contractor  our contracts and operations are subject to government oversight 
the government may investigate and make inquiries of our business practices and conduct audits of our contract performance and cost accounting 
these investigations may lead to claims against e s 
under united states government procurement regulations and practices  an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and or suspended for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on  or for award of  new government contracts  a conviction could result in debarment for a specified period of time 
our sales may suffer if we lose certain significant customers we currently derive a significant portion of our sales from a limited number of non us government customers 
the loss of any one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we were dependent on three of our non us government customers for approximately of our consolidated sales in we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales in the foreseeable future 
we have no assurance that sales from this limited number of customers will continue to reach or exceed historical levels in the future 
we do not have supply contracts with any of our significant customers 
our sales will decrease if we fail to maintain our international business any reduction of our international business could significantly affect our sales 
our international business accounted for of our sales 
we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our overall business in the foreseeable future 
our international business experiences many of the same risks our domestic business encounters as well as additional risks such as exposure to currency fluctuations and changes in foreign economic and political environments 
despite our exposure to currency fluctuations  we are not engaged in any material hedging activities to offset the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
our international transactions frequently involve increased financial and legal risks arising from stringent contractual terms and conditions and widely differing legal systems  customs  and standards in foreign countries 
in addition  our international sales often include sales to various foreign government armed forces  with many of the same inherent risks associated with united states government sales identified previously 
if our commercial simulation business fails  our sales will decrease we have no assurance that our commercial simulation airline business will continue to succeed 
our commercial simulation business currently accounts for approximately to of our sales 
this business is subject to many of the risks related to the commercial simulation market that may adversely affect our business 
the following risks are characteristic of the commercial simulation market uncertainty of economic conditions  dependence upon the strength of the commercial airline industry  air pilot training requirements  competition  changes in technology  and timely performance by subcontractors on contracts in which e s is the prime contractor 
we may make acquisitions that are unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources from more profitable operations we intend to consider acquisitions  alliances  and transactions involving other companies that could complement our existing business 
however  we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition parties  joint venture candidates  or transaction counter parties 
also  even if we can identify suitable parties  we may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to complete any such transaction or consummate these transactions on terms that we find favorable 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses that we acquire into our existing operations 
if we cannot successfully integrate acquisitions  our operating expenses may increase 
this increase would affect our net earnings  which could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities 
moreover  these types of transactions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  and amortization of expenses related to goodwill and intangible assets  all of which could adversely affect our profitability 
these transactions involve numerous other risks as well  including the diversion of management attention from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have had no or only limited experience  and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies 
occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on us 
our operations could be hurt by terrorist attacks and other activities that make air travel difficult or reduce the willingness of our commercial airline customers to purchase our simulation products 
during  million  or of our total revenue generated was derived from sales of our simulation products to commercial airline companies and other third parties in the commercial airline industry 
the demand for our various commercial simulation products and services is heavily dependant upon new orders from these commercial airline customers 
in the event terrorist attacks or other activities make air travel difficult or reduce the demand or willingness of our customers to purchase our commercial simulation products  our revenue may decline substantially 
since september   training requirements have increased to certify pilots  co pilots and flight engineers for different aircraft types and changing flight procedures 
however  at this time  we are unable to predict the long term impact of these events on either our industry as a whole or on our operations and financial condition in particular 
our shareholders may not realize certain opportunities because of the anti takeover effect of state law we may be subject to the utah control shares acquisition act which provides that any person who acquires or more of the outstanding voting shares of a publicly held utah corporation will not have voting rights with respect to the acquired shares unless a majority of the disinterested shareholders of the corporation votes to grant such rights 
this could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or other advantages that large accumulations of stock would provide because anyone interested in acquiring e s could only do so with the cooperation of our board of directors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
our international sales  which accounted for of our total sales in are concentrated in the united kingdom  continental europe and asia 
foreign currency purchase and sale contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes and do not use leveraged contracts 
as of december   we had three sales contracts and no material purchase contracts in currencies other than us dollars 
as of december   we had no foreign currency derivative contracts 
we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by maintaining a high proportion of our debt in fixed rate instruments 
as of december   of our total debt was in fixed rate instruments 
had we fully drawn on our million revolving line of credit with foothill capital corporation and our foreign line of credit  of our total debt would be in fixed rate instruments 
the information below summarizes e s s market risks associated with debt obligations as of december  fair values have been determined by quoted market prices 
for debt obligations  the table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates at year end by fiscal year of maturity
