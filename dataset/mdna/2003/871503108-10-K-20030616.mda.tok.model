the fiscal accounting year ending april  will comprise of weeks of operations  with the extra week coming in the first quarter of fiscal revenue recognition we derive revenue primarily from sales of packaged software products  perpetual software license agreements  product maintenance and services  and recognize this revenue in accordance with statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  when the following conditions have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  passage of title occurs  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  if applicable  customer acceptance has been received  collection of a fixed or determinable license fee is considered probable  and if appropriate  reasonable estimates of future product returns have been made 
we sell packaged products  which primarily include consumer products  through a multi tiered distribution channel 
we defer revenue on all distribution and reseller channel inventory in excess of specified inventory levels in these channels 
we defer a portion of revenue for product bundled with content updates 
this deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the initial year that such updates are provided 
we offer the right of return of our products under various policies and programs with our distributors  resellers and end user customers 
we estimate and record reserves for end user product returns and channel and end user rebates  and we account for these reserves as an offset to revenue 
we enter into perpetual software license agreements mainly for our enterprise security and enterprise administration products primarily through indirect sales with distributors and resellers 
the license agreements generally include product maintenance agreements  for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the agreements 
our services include managed security services  consulting and education 
we recognize managed security services revenue ratably over the period that such contracted services are provided 
we recognize consulting services revenue as services are performed or upon written acceptance from customers  if applicable 
we recognize education services revenue as services are performed 
in arrangements that include perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services  and packaged products with content updates multiple elements  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of the undelivered elements  and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue 
our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance and consumer product content updates 
vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties 
if vsoe does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance or services  then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 

table of contents critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported amounts of net revenue  operating income and net income loss  as well as on the value of certain assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
see summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page in the consolidated financial statements for more information about these critical accounting policies  as well as descriptions of other significant accounting policies 
we have engaged in discussions with our audit committee of the board of directors regarding the development  selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies 
channel revenue deferrals we defer revenue relating to products  primarily in our consumer and enterprise administration segments  that we have shipped into our distribution and reseller channels to the extent that inventory levels are in excess of certain specified inventory levels for these channels 
we defer this revenue as an offset to accounts receivable 
we estimate the excess inventory in these channels by analyzing channel inventory levels and distribution sell through trends obtained from our channel partners  as well as various historical trends on a product basis 
in addition  we consider other factors in assessing these specified inventory levels  such as product seasonality  current market conditions  economic trends  existing security threats and timing of new product releases 
on the same basis  we defer the associated cost of revenues related to the channel revenue deferral 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues and cost of revenues for any period presented 
reserves for product returns end users may return our products  primarily within our consumer and enterprise administration segments  through distributors and resellers or to us directly for a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase 
our estimated reserves for such end user product returns  which are recorded as an offset to revenue  are based primarily on historical trends 
our return policy allows distributors and resellers  subject to certain contractual limitations  to return purchased products in exchange for new products or for credit towards future purchases 
product returns by distributors and resellers principally relate to stock balancing and the replacement of obsolete products 
channel revenue deferrals  as discussed above  are designed to take into account any distributor and reseller stock balancing returns 
in addition  we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels 
we also consider other factors such as the timing of upgrades and new versions of products  current market conditions  economic trends and changes in technology 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 
reserves for rebates we estimate and record reserves as an offset to revenue for channel and end user rebates  related primarily to products within our enterprise security  enterprise administration and consumer segments 
our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs  which are typically entered into quarterly 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated on the terms and conditions of the promotional program  actual sales during the promotion  amount of actual redemptions received  historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and the value of the rebate 
we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserve for rebates 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potential uncollectible trade receivables 
we review our trade receivables by aging category to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues 
we exercise judgment when determining the adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt trends  general economic conditions in the us and internationally  and changes in customer financial conditions 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences may result in additional reserves for trade receivables  which would be reflected by charges in general and administrative expenses for any period presented 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized and that goodwill be tested for 
table of contents impairment annually  or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant 
we performed the initial goodwill impairment test required by sfas no 
during the june quarter 
we identified four reporting units  which represent our primary operating segments see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k  and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill recorded upon implementation of sfas no 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the march quarter and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
we will continue to test for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  or earlier if indicators of impairment exist 
we also evaluate long lived and intangible assets  including property  equipment  leasehold improvements and acquired product rights  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
significant judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences may result in write downs of net long lived and intangible assets  which would be reflected by charges to our operating results for any period presented 
restructuring and site closures during fiscal and  we incurred expenses related to consolidating  moving and relocating various groups or sites 
in determining the charge related to our excess facilities  certain estimates were used  such as the ability to sublease the facilities  the terms of future subleases  broker commissions  costs of tenant improvements and related exit costs 
in developing our estimates  we obtained information from third party leasing agents to calculate anticipated third party sublease income and the vacancy period prior to finding a sub leasee 
market conditions will affect our ability to sublease facilities on terms consistent with our estimates 
our ability to sublease facilities ahead of schedule or the negotiation of lease terms resulting in higher or lower sublease income than estimated will affect our accrual and the related charge for restructuring  site closures and other expenses 
differences between estimates of related broker commissions  tenant improvements and related exit costs may increase or decrease our accrual upon final negotiation 
if we employed different assumptions regarding these various components of our exit costs  the costs recorded for any period presented could vary materially from those actually recorded 
deferred income taxes on a quarterly basis we evaluate our deferred tax asset balance for realizability 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we will establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future us taxable income and future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions  as well as our implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
recent events during the september quarter  we acquired the following four privately held companies for approximately million in cash riptech  inc  a provider of scalable  real time managed security services that protect clients through advanced outsourced security monitoring and professional services 
recourse technologies  inc  a provider of security threat management solutions that detect  analyze and respond to both known and novel threats  including intrusions  internal attacks and denial of service attacks 
securityfocus inc  a provider of enterprise security threat management systems  providing global early warning of cyber attacks  customized and comprehensive threat alerts  and countermeasures to prevent attacks before they occur 
mountain wave  inc  a provider of automated attack sensing and warning software and services for real time enterprise security operations management 
as a result of these acquisitions  we recorded  as adjusted for revised estimates related to certain liabilities  approximately million for acquired in process research and development  million for developed technology and acquired product rights  million for goodwill  million for other intangibles  million

net revenues net revenues increased to approximately billion during fiscal from billion during fiscal and to billion during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to increased sales of our consumer products and enterprise security products 
the increased sales of our consumer products and enterprise security products was largely attributable to continuing growth in demand for our virus protection solutions from large organizations as well as from small businesses and consumers 
from a regional standpoint  the increase was primarily due to growth in net revenues internationally and  to a lesser extent  in the united states 
strength in major foreign currencies during fiscal also positively impacted our international revenue growth 
the increase during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to increased sales of our enterprise security products and a significant increase in sales of our consumer products during the second half of fiscal the increase in enterprise security products during fiscal was attributable to a full year of sales related to 
table of contents axent solutions as compared to approximately three months during fiscal from a regional standpoint  this increase was primarily due to growth in net revenues in the united states and to a lesser extent in emea 
a significant portion of our deferred revenue balance of million as of march  contributed to our total net revenues during fiscal we anticipate that our deferred revenue balance of million as of march   will also be a significant portion of our net revenues during the first quarter of fiscal segments our enterprise security segment provides organizations with internet security technology  global response and services to manage their information security needs 
our enterprise security segment represented approximately  and of net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
net revenues increased approximately million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to strong growth in sales of our virus protection and firewall vpn product solutions 
net revenues increased million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to our first full year of sales of intrusion detection  security management and firewall product solutions  as a result of our acquisition of axent in december  and in particular  significant growth in sales of virus protection product solutions 
our enterprise administration segment offers products that enable companies to be more effective and efficient within their information technology departments 
our enterprise administration segment represented approximately  and of net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
net revenues decreased approximately million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal and decreased million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal these decreases were primarily due to a decrease in sales of our pcanywhere product  partially offset by growth in our ghost corporate edition product 
we anticipate net revenues from this segment to comprise a smaller percentage of our overall revenues going forward 
our consumer products segment provides security and problem solving products to individual users  home offices and small businesses 
our consumer products segment represented approximately  and of net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
net revenues increased approximately million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily related to stronger than expected consumer and small business spending  which contributed to the increase in sales of our norton antivirus and norton internet security products 
our electronic distribution channel  including original equipment manufacturer subscription renewals  also contributed to the increase in sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal net revenues increased by approximately million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily related to an increase in sales of our norton antivirus and norton internet security products  mostly as a result of strong consumer and small business spending  and an increase in the renewal subscription pricing of our antivirus products 
this increase was offset by a decline in sales of our winfax and macintosh products 
we do not expect our consumer product net revenues to grow at as high a rate during fiscal as during fiscal our services segment provides information security solutions that incorporate best of breed technology  security expertise and global resources 
our services segment represented approximately  and less than of net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
net revenues increased approximately million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily related to sales from our managed security services  which represented approximately million of net revenues during fiscal net revenues increased approximately million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due primarily to the increase in demand for our consulting services 
our other segment is comprised of sunset products and products nearing the end of their life cycle and represented less than of net revenues during each of the fiscal years  and international net revenues outside of the united states represented approximately  and of net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
international net revenues increased by approximately million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase in net revenues was primarily the result of sales growth in emea and to a lesser extent in japan  primarily from increased sales of our enterprise security and consumer products 
international net revenues increased by approximately million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase in net revenues was the result of increased sales in emea and asia pacific  primarily from increased sales of our enterprise security and consumer products 

table of contents strength in major foreign currencies during fiscal  as compared to the average major foreign currency rates during fiscal  positively impacted our international revenue growth by approximately million 
weakness in major foreign currencies during fiscal  as compared to the average major foreign currency rates during fiscal  negatively impacted our international revenue growth by approximately million 
we are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency rates 
if international sales become a greater proportion of our total sales in the future  changes in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating results 
gross margin gross margin represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing expenses  costs for producing manuals and cds  packaging costs  royalties paid to third parties under publishing contracts  costs of services  fee based technical support costs and amortization of acquired product rights 
as a percentage of net revenues  gross margin remained flat at approximately during fiscal year and and was during the decline in gross margins during fiscal and as compared to fiscal was mostly driven by increased amortization of acquired product rights from our four acquisitions in september and our acquisition of axent in december  along with an increase in fee based technical support costs related to increased enterprise sales 
in addition  the costs associated with services increased with the corresponding increase in services revenue  and our services typically generate lower gross margins than our software products 
acquired product rights acquired product rights are comprised of purchased product rights  technologies  databases and revenue related order backlog and contracts from acquired companies 
during fiscal  we recorded approximately million  net in acquired product rights related primarily to our acquisitions of riptech  recourse  securityfocus and mountain wave  and during fiscal  we recorded approximately million in acquired product rights in connection with our acquisition of axent 
during fiscal  amortization of acquired product rights totaled approximately million  of which million and million was recorded in cost of revenues and income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines  respectively

amortization of goodwill and other intangibles from acquisitions amortization of goodwill and other intangibles from acquisitions decreased to approximately million during fiscal from million during fiscal this decrease was due to the adoption of sfas no 
on april   under which the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but are subject to an annual impairment test 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles from acquisitions increased to approximately million during fiscal from million during fiscal this increase was related primarily to the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with the acquisition of axent in december acquired in process research and development expenses acquired in process research and development was million during fiscal  due to the riptech  securityfocus and recourse acquisitions in the september quarter 
we recorded no acquired in process research and development charges during fiscal during fiscal  we acquired axent and wrote off approximately million of acquired in process research and development associated with this acquisition 
these write offs were necessary because the acquired technologies had not yet reached technological feasibility and there were no alternative uses 
the efforts required to develop the acquired in process technology principally related to the completion of all planning  design  development and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can be produced to meet its design specifications including features  functions and performance 
we expect the acquired in process technology to be developed into commercially feasible products 
however  there are no assurances that this will occur 
if we fail to complete these products in their entirety  or in a timely manner  we may not continue to attract new users  we may be unable to retain our existing users and the value of the other intangible assets may become impaired 
we determined the fair value of the acquired in process technology for each of the purchases by estimating the projected cash flows related to these projects and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
we discounted the resulting cash flows back to their net present values 
we based the net cash flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective markets and estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects 
a valuation specialist used our estimates to establish the amount of acquired in process research and development to be written off for these acquisitions during fiscal and actual spending on these product development projects since our acquisition of the companies discussed below did not differ materially from the original assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings 
riptech the in process technology acquired in the riptech acquisition consisted primarily of research and development related to the fourth generation of its caltarian technology  which provides real time information protection through around the clock monitoring  analysis and response 
we plan to integrate this technology into our managed security services 

table of contents securityfocus the in process technology acquired in the securityfocus acquisition consisted primarily of research and development related to new versions of deepsight threat management system and deepsight analyzer products  which are threat management systems that provide early warnings of attack  as well as countermeasures to defend these attacks 
we plan to integrate this technology into our security management products 
recourse the in process technology acquired in the recourse acquisition consisted primarily of research and development related to new versions of manhunt  a network intrusion detection system 
we plan to integrate this technology into our intrusion detection products 
axent the in process technology acquired in the axent acquisition consisted primarily of research and development related to the next generation of esm  intruder alert  raptor firewall  webthority and other projects 
axent s research and development was focused on providing more robust features in its development of these next generation products 
we have added these projects to our product offerings  with the exception of webthority  which was divested with our web access management product line in august restructuring  site closures and other restructuring  site closures and other were approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  we recorded approximately million for costs of severance  related benefits and outplacement services primarily associated with the relocation of our leiden  netherlands operations to dublin  ireland  the relocation of certain development  sales and finance activities  the outsourcing of our north american and european consumer support functions  the realignment of certain worldwide marketing efforts  and the reduction in operations in san antonio  texas 
as a result  we terminated employees 
in addition  we recorded approximately million for exit costs associated with the consolidation of certain facilities in the united states 
these expenses were offset by a net reduction in expenses of approximately million  due primarily to revised estimates of certain fiscal facility related expenses 
during fiscal  we incurred expenses related to consolidating smaller sites into a larger facility in newport news  virginia  consolidating most of our united kingdom facilities to maidenhead  uk  consolidating our european support functions by moving our leiden  netherlands facility to dublin  ireland and relocating our north american support group to springfield  oregon 
as a result  we recorded approximately million for exit costs  including million in rent and related exit costs remaining on the abandoned facilities and million in related abandoned fixed asset and leasehold improvement write offs 
in addition  we recorded approximately million for costs of severance  related benefits and outplacement services  as we reorganized various operating functions  including former axent operations  and terminated employees 
during fiscal  we reorganized various operating functions  including a portion of our operations in toronto 
we terminated employees and ten members of our senior management  and as a result  we recorded approximately million for costs of severance  related benefits  outplacement services and abandonment of certain equipment

for further discussion on our current litigation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
there was no corresponding accrual during fiscal or fiscal operating income operating income was approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the primary factor in the increase between fiscal and was our adoption of sfas no 
as a result  in fiscal  we recorded no amortization of goodwill  compared with a charge of million during fiscal in addition  strength in major foreign currencies during fiscal  as compared to the average major foreign currency rates during fiscal  positively impacted our operating income growth by approximately million 
weakness in major foreign currencies during fiscal  as compared to the average major foreign 
table of contents currency rates during fiscal  negatively impacted our operating income growth by approximately million 
we are unable to predict the extent to which operating income in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency rates 
interest income  interest expense and other expense  net interest income was approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase was due to higher average invested cash balances during fiscal as compared to fiscal although interest income was relatively flat during fiscal and fiscal  average cash balances were higher during fiscal as compared to fiscal  which was offset by a decrease in average interest rates 
interest expense was approximately million and million during fiscal and  respectively  nearly all of which was related to the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes in october interest expense was not significant during fiscal other expense  net of approximately million and million during fiscal and  respectively  was primarily comprised of net losses from non functional currency transactions 
other expense  net was approximately million during fiscal and consisted primarily of impairment charges on our equity investments 
income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines was approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  and  income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines was related primarily to royalty payments received  in connection with the divestiture of our act product line in december  from interact commerce corporation  which subsequently merged with the sage group plc 
during fiscal  this royalty income was offset by the write off of approximately million of developed technology related to the web access management products that were divested in the september quarter 
income taxes our effective tax rate on income before taxes was approximately  and during fiscal  and  respectively 
the higher effective tax rate in fiscal and reflects the non deductibility of acquired in process research and development and substantially all of the goodwill amortization 
realization of our net deferred tax asset at march  is dependent primarily upon future us taxable income and our implementation of tax planning strategies 
we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized based on historical earnings and expected levels of future taxable income as well as the implementation of tax planning strategies 
levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in the business risk factors set forth in this item an additional valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we will assess the need for an additional valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
we project our effective tax rate to be for fiscal this projection  however  is subject to change due to potential tax law changes and fluctuations in the geographic distribution of earnings 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as well as the cash that we generate over time from our operations 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased million to approximately billion at the end of fiscal from billion at the end of fiscal this increase is primarily due to cash provided by operations  net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sales of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan

net trade accounts receivable increased million to approximately million as of march  from million as of march  the increase in net trade accounts receivable was primarily due to higher sales in the month of march compared to the month of march and an unusually low net trade accounts receivable balance at march  as compared to the prior six quarter end balances 
in prior quarters  we had generated a larger percentage of net revenues during the last month of each quarter 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively

newly adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements on april   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test 
other intangibles will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
in addition  sfas no 
required acquired workforce in place to be reclassified as goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased the amortization of goodwill and recharacterized acquired workforce in place and the related deferred tax liability as goodwill on april  we also performed the initial goodwill impairment test required by sfas no 
during the june quarter 
we identified four reporting units  which represent our primary operating segments as indicated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k  and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill recorded upon implementation of sfas no 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the march quarter and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
we will continue to test for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  or earlier if indicators of impairment exist 
as a result of the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill existing as of march   the application of sfas no 
resulted in an increase in our results of operations of approximately million during fiscal at march   we had goodwill of approximately million 
on april   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and elements of apb no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual  and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that the liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than when a commitment is made to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
sfas no 
became effective for exit or disposal activities that were initiated after december  the adoption of this statement may result in recognizing the cost of future restructuring activities  if any  over a period of time rather than in the reporting period that the plan of restructuring is adopted 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
under this interpretation  a liability shall be recognized for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing or modifying guarantees and indemnification agreements after december  certain of the software licenses that we have granted contain provisions that indemnify licensees of the software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
we have historically received only a limited number of requests for indemnification under these provisions and have not been required to make material payments pursuant to these provisions 
accordingly  we have not recorded a liability related to these indemnification provisions 
as of march   we had no liability associated with any of our indemnification agreements on our balance sheet 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 that provides guidance for determining when a primary beneficiary should consolidate a variable interest entity that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
the effective date of interpretation no 
is the first interim period beginning after june  for variable interest entities acquired before february  and immediately to variable interest entities created after january  in the march quarter  we purchased four of our facilities that were classified as operating leases under synthetic lease transactions by purchasing the land and buildings for approximately million and million  respectively 
as such  we had no interest in any variable interest entities as of march  in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which provides guidance for classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this statement will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
business risk factors there is uncertainty as to whether or not we will be able to sustain the growth rates in sales of our products  particularly in consumer antivirus protection products 
during fiscal and the second half of fiscal  we experienced a higher than expected rate of growth in sales of our consumer antivirus protection products  and we expect that we will not be able to sustain this high growth rate on a consistent basis 
we believe that consumer antivirus sales have been spurred by a number of factors over the past six quarters  including increased broadband connection  increased awareness of security threats to consumer systems  particularly the well publicized code red  nimda  klez  opaserv  yaha  bugbear  lovegate and slammer threats and a reaction from the september  terrorist attacks 
the impact of these factors is likely to diminish over time  and it is possible that growth rates in sales of antivirus protection products may decline 
our efforts to develop and sell appliances and integrated solutions involve risk 
we have recently begun selling appliances in which our software is embedded with hardware 
because of our limited experience with the manufacture of appliances  and because our appliances generate lower gross margins than our software products  our efforts to develop and sell appliances may not be as successful as we anticipate 
in addition  our strategy for future growth includes integrating our various security technologies  management  customer service and support into a single enterprise security solution 
we have begun implementing this strategy by selling integrated solutions  such as symantec gateway security and symantec client security 
our integrated solutions may not achieve market acceptance and may not be able to compete with solutions either currently in the market or introduced in the future 
if we are unable to achieve market acceptance or compete effectively with solutions of our competitors  our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 
economic and political conditions and conditions affecting the network security market in particular may have a negative impact on our revenues and margins 
the market for our products depends on economic conditions affecting the broader network security  internet infrastructure and related markets 
more generally  the slowdown in the us economy may hurt consumer demand for our products 
on the enterprise side  the continued slowdown in corporate earnings and tightening of corporate budgets may cause potential customers to delay or cancel security projects  reduce their overall or security specific information technology budgets  or reduce or cancel orders for our products 
further  in this environment  customers may experience financial difficulty  cease operations or fail to budget for the purchase of our products 
this  in turn  may lead to longer sales cycles  price pressures and collection issues  causing us to realize lower revenues and margins 
in addition  the terrorist acts of september  and the fall out of the war in the middle east have created an uncertain economic and political environment in many parts of the world  and we cannot predict the impact of these events  or of any related military action  on our customers or business 
we face risks associated with our foreign operations 
a significant portion of our manufacturing costs and operating expenses result from transactions outside of the united states  often in foreign currencies 
our international sales have been increasing as a percentage of our total sales and  for the first time during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  comprised slightly more than of our total sales 
in fiscal year  our operating results have been positively affected by changes in foreign currency rates 
our future operating results will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates  especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales  and we may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future 
our operating results could also be adversely affected by general uncertainty with each country s political and 
table of contents economic structure 
in addition  governmental regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain any required export approval of our technologies  particularly our encryption technologies  could impede our international sales 
in light of recent terrorist activity and political and military instability internationally  governments could enact additional regulation or restrictions on the use  import or export of encryption technologies 
additional regulation of encryption technologies could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications 
this might decrease demand for our products and services 
in addition  the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars could have an adverse impact on our operations in asia 
if there is a significant spread of sars beyond asia  other aspects of our operations could be negatively impacted 
demand for our products is subject to seasonal trends 
although there is no assurance this trend will continue  our sales of consumer products over the last seven years have been seasonal  with higher sales generally in our december and march quarters 
in addition  we anticipate that sales of enterprise security products may be higher in the march quarter in the future  as our sales force attempts to close transactions before the end of our fiscal year 
to the extent seasonality makes it more difficult to predict our revenues and value our business  our stock price may suffer and the volatility of our stock may increase 
introduction and integration of new products and technology may adversely affect our financial results 
we have recently introduced new products  including newly acquired products and products incorporating newly acquired technology from our acquisitions 
examples of these products include manhunt  symantec decoy server formerly mantrap  deepsight threat management system and deepsight alert services 
these products may not achieve market acceptance and or may not be able to compete with products either currently in the market or introduced in the future 
if these products do not achieve market success  we may not achieve operating results that investors and analysts expect and  as a result  the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
increased reliance on sales of enterprise licenses may result in greater fluctuations in  or otherwise adversely affect  our financial results 
sales of enterprise licenses through our enterprise security segment represent a major portion of our business 
enterprise licensing arrangements involve a longer sales cycle than sales through other distribution channels  require greater investment of resources in establishing the enterprise relationship  may involve greater pricing pressure and sometimes result in lower operating margins 
in recent quarters  the number of higher dollar value enterprise license contracts has increased and our reliance on such contracts in the future may result in increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues 
in addition  the timing of the execution of volume licenses  or their nonrenewal by large customers  could cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
we are dependent upon certain partners to distribute our products and we would be adversely affected if these relationships terminate or diminish 
a large portion of our enterprise sales is made through value added and other resellers  and a large portion of our consumer sales is made through the retail distribution channel 
reliance on these channels subjects us to events that cause unpredictability in demand 
this increases the risk that we may not plan effectively for the future  which could result in adverse operating results in future periods 
our distribution partners may also offer our competitors products 
their decisions to sell our products are partly a function of pricing  terms and special promotions offered by our competitors and other factors that we do not control and cannot predict 
our agreements with partners are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by them or by us without cause 
we would be adversely affected if companies in our partner program chose to sell greater amounts of competitive offerings relative to the amount they sell of our offerings 
in addition  one of the channels through which we sell our consumer products is original equipment manufacturers  or oems  who bundle our antivirus and other products with their pcs 
we continuously seek to establish new oem relationships and  conversely  are subject to oems who bundle our software with their products deciding either to discontinue bundling third party security software or to switch to a competitor s product 
when we lose an oem relationship  our consumer sales could be adversely affected unless and until we are able to establish new relationships of similar significance 
some distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past 
distribution partners may experience financial difficulties in the future 
if these partners do experience financial difficulties  we may experience reduced sales or increased write offs  which would adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents we have grown  and may continue to grow  through acquisitions  which give rise to a number of risks that could have adverse consequences for our future operating results 
we completed four acquisitions during the september quarter  have announced two additional acquisitions during fiscal  and will likely pursue future acquisitions 
integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
to integrate acquired businesses  we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations 
our success in completing the integration of acquired businesses may impact the market acceptance of such acquisitions  and our willingness to acquire additional businesses in the future 
further  the difficulties of integrating acquired businesses could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management focus from other opportunities and challenges  and increase our expenses and working capital requirements 
our recent acquisitions have resulted in  and acquisitions we complete in the future may also cause us to recognize  substantial amounts of goodwill that will be subject to an annual  or if events require  a more frequent impairment test and other intangible assets that will be amortized and also subject to impairment testing 
in addition  acquisitions may result in substantial restructuring and other related expenses and write offs of acquired in process research and development costs 
further  we may need to issue equity or incur additional debt to finance future acquisitions  which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders or could increase our leverage 
any of these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired operations or to realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition 
our markets are competitive and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to anticipate or react to this competition 
our markets are competitive 
if we are unable to anticipate or react to this competition  our operating results could be adversely affected by reducing our sales or the prices we can charge for our products 
many of our competitors have significantly lowered  and may continue to lower  the price of their products and we may have to do the same to remain competitive 
our ability to remain competitive depends  in part  on our ability to enhance our products or develop new products that are compatible with new hardware and operating systems 
we have no control over  and limited insight into  development efforts by third parties with respect to new hardware and operating systems  and we may not respond effectively or timely to such changes in the market 
in addition  we have limited resources and we must make strategic decisions as to the best allocation of our resources to position ourselves for changes in our markets 
we may from time to time allocate resources to projects or markets that do not develop as rapidly or fully as we expect 
we may fail to allocate resources to third party products  to markets or to business models that are more successful than we anticipate 
the trend toward consolidation in the software industry could impede our ability to compete effectively 
consolidation is underway among companies in the software industry as firms seek to offer more extensive suites of software products and broader arrays of software and integrated software and hardware solutions 
changes resulting from this consolidation may negatively impact our competitive position 
in addition  to the extent that we seek to expand our product lines and skills and capacity through acquisitions  the trend toward consolidation may result in our encountering competition  and paying higher prices  for acquired businesses 
operating system providers  and network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers are becoming substantial competitors in the market for security solutions 
these competitors generally have significantly greater financial  marketing or technological resources than we do  and may leverage their strengths at the computing platform  security layer and network tier levels to compete more aggressively in the market for security solutions 
continued development  acquisition  or licensing of security solutions technology or products rights by one or more of these competitors could negatively impact our competitive position in the market for security solutions 
for example  the continued inclusion of security  remote access or virus protection tools in new operating systems and hardware packages could adversely affect our sales 
in particular  the inclusion of features by microsoft in future editions of windows which directly compete with our products may decrease or delay the demand for certain of our products  including those currently under development 
additionally  as hardware vendors incorporate security functions in the network equipment or integrate security within their network and system management products  the demand may decrease for some of our products  including those currently under development 
piracy of our software may have a significant impact on our net revenues 
although we are unable to determine the extent of piracy of our software products  software piracy may depress our net revenues 
while this would adversely affect domestic revenue  revenue loss is believed to be even more significant outside of the united states  particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights 
we engage in efforts to educate consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and to educate lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected  and we cooperate with the business software alliance in their efforts to combat piracy 
however  such continued efforts may not be successful in preventing piracy of our products from occurring 

table of contents our software products and web site may be subject to intentional disruption 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions  such as software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of our products  we expect to be an ongoing target of such disruptions 
similarly  experienced computer programmers  or hackers  may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our web site and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services 
uninterrupted online availability of our web site is becoming increasingly important as online subscription renewals comprise a larger portion of our revenues 
our activities could be substantially disrupted  and our reputation and future sales harmed  if these efforts are successful 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results have affected our stock price in the past and could affect our stock price in the future 
if our quarterly operating results or our predictions of future operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors  the trading price of shares of our common stock and of the notes could be negatively affected 
our quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and may vary substantially in the future depending upon a number of factors  including the timing of announcements and releases of new or enhanced versions of our products and product upgrades  the introduction of competitive products  uncertainty about and customer confidence in the current economic conditions and outlook  reduced demand for any given product  unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  seasonality in the end of period buying patterns of foreign and domestic software customers  and the market s transition between new releases of operating systems 
any such volatility may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into our common stock 
in addition to the foregoing factors  the risk of quarterly fluctuations is increased by the fact that a significant portion of our net revenues has historically been generated during the last month of each fiscal quarter 
most resellers tend to make a majority of their purchases at the end of a fiscal quarter 
in addition  many enterprise customers negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter 
our reliance on a large portion of revenue occurring at the end of the quarter and the increase in the dollar value of transactions that occur at the end of a quarter can result in increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues 
due to this end of period buying pattern  forecasts may not be achieved  either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us 
in addition  these factors increase the chances that our results could diverge from the expectations of investors and analysts 
we continue to make substantial changes to our information systems that could disrupt our business 
during fiscal  we began implementing oracle i and a new customer relationship management system 
we completed the worldwide implementation of oracle i in the september quarter 
the first four phases of the crm implementation occurred in june  february  june and november  with the remaining implementation phase scheduled for the first quarter of fiscal these types of transitions frequently prove disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and may cause us to incur higher costs than we anticipate 
failure to manage a smooth transition to the new systems and the ongoing operations and support of the new systems could materially harm our business operations 
we must effectively adapt to changes in the dynamic technological environment 
we are increasingly focused on the internet security market  which  in turn is dependent on further acceptance and increased use of the internet 
the following critical issues concerning the use of the internet remain unresolved and may affect the market for our products and the use of the internet as a medium to distribute or support our software products and the functionality of some of our products security  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  quality of service  and potential tax or other government regulations 
in addition  new technologies  such as wireless devices  are gaining acceptance 
we must adapt to these changing technological demands 
if we are unable to timely assimilate changes brought about by the internet and wireless based environments  our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 
the results of our research and development efforts are uncertain 
we will need to continue to incur significant research and development expenditures in future periods as we strive to remain competitive 
the length of our product development cycle for new products and product enhancements has frequently been greater than we originally expected  and we are likely to experience delays in future product development 
in addition  a portion of 
table of contents our development efforts has not been technologically successful and certain products have not achieved market acceptance 
as a result  the products we are currently developing or may develop in the future may not be technologically successful  achieve market acceptance or compete effectively with products of our competitors 
product returns may negatively affect our net revenues 
product returns can occur when we introduce upgrades and new versions of products or when distributors or retailers have excess inventories  subject to various contractual limitations 
our return policy allows distributors  subject to these contractual limitations  to return purchased products in exchange for new products or credit towards future purchases 
end users may return our products for a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase 
future returns could exceed the reserves we have established for product returns  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we depend on internal communications systems that may be disrupted 
our order management and product shipping centers are geographically dispersed 
a business disruption could occur as a result of natural disasters or the interruption in service by communications carriers 
if our communications between these centers are disrupted  particularly at the end of a fiscal quarter  we may suffer an unexpected shortfall in net revenues and a resulting adverse impact on our operating results 
communication outages  internet connectivity disruptions  and or increased volumes of electronic distribution transactions may also cause delays in customer access to our internet based services or product sales 
we are subject to litigation that could adversely affect our financial results 
from time to time  we may be subject to claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others  or other product liability claims  or other claims incidental to our business 
we are currently involved in a number of lawsuits 
we intend to defend all of these lawsuits vigorously 
however  it is possible that we could suffer an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases 
depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable resolutions of these lawsuits  our future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period 
although infringement claims may ultimately prove to be without merit  they are expensive to defend and may consume our resources or divert our attention from day to day operations 
if a third party alleges that we have infringed their intellectual property rights  we may choose to litigate the claim and or seek an appropriate license from the third party 
if we engage in litigation and the third party is found to have a valid patent claim against us and a license is not available on reasonable terms  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
we must attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management  sales  marketing and technical personnel 
to accomplish this  we believe that we must provide personnel with a competitive compensation package  including stock options 
increases in shares available for issuance under our stock options plans require stockholder approval in many cases  and institutional stockholders  or stockholders generally  may not approve future increases 
additionally  the accounting industry has recently determined that corporations will include a compensation expense in their statement of operations relating to the issuance of employee stock options 
this will most likely become effective in calendar year as a result  we may decide to issue fewer stock options and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel 
conversely  issuing a comparable number of stock options could adversely impact our results of operations 
our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequately protected from all unauthorized uses 
we regard our software and underlying technology as proprietary 
we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws 
third parties may copy aspects of our products or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or develop similar technology independently 
all of our products are protected by copyright laws  and we have a number of patents and patent applications pending 
we may not achieve the desired protection from  and third parties may design around  our patents 
in addition  existing copyright laws afford limited practical protection 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the united states  and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products 
any legal action that we may bring to protect proprietary information could be expensive and may distract management from day to day operations 
our inabilities to timely distribute our products and services over the internet  and security patches and updated virus definitions via our liveupdate feature in particular  could adversely affect our business 
our ability to maintain and increase the speed with which we provide services to consumers and to increase the scope of these services is limited by and dependent upon the speed and reliability of the internet 
as we incorporate the 
table of contents liveupdate technology into more of our products  we are increasingly reliant on the internet as a means to distribute our security patches and updated virus definitions to our customers 
accordingly  if we  or our customers  are unable to utilize the internet due to a failure of technology  infrastructure or other reasons  our ability to provide services may suffer  which could lead to a decrease in revenues 
our products are complex and are operated in a wide variety of computer configurations  which could result in errors or product failures 
because we offer very complex products  undetected errors  failures or bugs may occur when they are first introduced or when new versions are released 
our products often are installed and used in large scale computing environments with different operating systems  system management software and equipment and networking configurations  which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors  failures or bugs in our products 
in the past  we have discovered software errors  failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and have experienced delays or lost revenues during the period required to correct these errors 
our customers computer environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non standard configurations that make pre release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming 
despite testing by us and by others  errors  failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments 
errors  failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity  product returns  loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or claims by customers or others 
in addition  if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in one of our end customer s security systems  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and resources and could cause interruptions  delays or cessation of our product licensing  which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and would adversely affect results of operations 
most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may not prove effective in limiting our liability 
increased utilization and costs of our technical support services may adversely affect our financial results 
like many companies in the software industry  technical support costs comprise a significant portion of our operating costs and expenses 
over the short term  we may be unable to respond to fluctuations in customer demand for support services  including periods of high customer usage in which delays may be experienced 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors 
further  customer demand for these services could cause increases in the costs of providing such services and adversely affect our operating results 
over the past year  we have outsourced our north american and european consumer support functions 
as such  we are highly dependent on the on going business success of the companies with whom we have contracted to provide these services 
if these companies experience financial difficulties  do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts  the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted  which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in market prices  interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates 
we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
all financial instruments used are in accordance with our global investment policy and global foreign exchange policy 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we also hold equity interests in six privately held companies 
these investments were recorded at cost  and are classified as other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
these investments are inherently risky and we could lose our entire initial investment in these companies 
as of march   these investments had a carrying value of approximately million 
interest rate sensitivity we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
all of our cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as available for sale as of the balance sheet dates 
these securities are reported at fair market value and any unrealized gains and losses are included as a component in stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
our cash equivalents and short term investments consist primarily of corporate securities  taxable auction rate securities  us government and government sponsored securities  money market funds and asset backed securities

during october  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes 
the notes pay interest semi annually and mature on november  as of march   we had approximately million principal amount of notes outstanding 
exchange rate sensitivity we conduct business in international currencies through our worldwide operations 
we believe that the use of foreign exchange forward contracts should reduce the risks that arise from conducting business in international markets 
we hedge risks associated with certain foreign currency cash  investments  receivables and payables in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency fluctuations on these assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign exchange forward contracts as of march  were as follows in millions resulting increase decrease in fv of foreign forward exchange contracts given x appreciation devaluation of foreign currency foreign forward notional exchange contracts amount purchased sold we believe that these foreign exchange forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk from the movement of foreign exchange rates because gains and losses on these contracts are offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities 
all contracts have a maturity of no more than days 
gains and losses are accounted for as other expense  net each period 
we regularly review our hedging program and may make changes as a result of this review
