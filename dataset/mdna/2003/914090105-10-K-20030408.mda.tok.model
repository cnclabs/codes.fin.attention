item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the changes in financial position and results of operations over the past several years 
investors should refer to the consolidated financial statements  the related notes thereto  and statistical information presented elsewhere in this report when reading this section of the report 
the cautionary statements described below are for the purpose of qualifying for the safe harbor provisions of section e of the securities exchange act of risk factors our business involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this report before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  with the loss of all or part of an investment in our common stock 
described below  are the material risks of investing in university bancorp s common stock 
investors should carefully consider these prior to purchasing any shares 
if we are delisted from the nasdaq small cap market the marketability of our shares could decrease nasdaq has informed management that the company s common stock would be de listed from the nasdaq small cap market if the bid price of the company s common stock does not trade for at least per share for ten consecutive trading days prior to september  if the company s common stock is de listed from nasdaq  the shares will be less marketable in the future and there will be a smaller potential pool of investors for the stock 
this would significantly limit the ability of shareholders deciding to sell their shares to do so 
if the company is de listed  the management of university bancorp could opt to list its common stock on the nasdaq bulletin board 
you may not be able to sell your shares upon demand although the company s common stock is currently listed for trading on the nasdaq small cap market  the trading market for university bancorp historically has been less active than the average trading market for companies listed on the exchange 
in addition  the share price of university bancorp has been volatile and has ranged from to in the past months 
factors such as the limited number of shares outstanding held by the public  a limited history of earnings and the absence of dividends in the near future mean that there might not be an active and liquid market for the company s common stock 
even if an active market develops  there can be no assurance that a market will continue 
purchasers of the company s common stock should carefully consider the potentially illiquid and long term nature of their investment in the shares 
the company s stock is controlled by insiders of the company  which may not provide you with the best possible return on your investment insiders hold a majority of the shares outstanding of the company 
the ranzini group mr 
stephen lange ranzini  dr 
joseph lange ranzini  mr 
paul lange ranzini  orpheus capital  lp and the ranzini family trust dated beneficially owns  or of the issued and outstanding shares at march  these individuals are able to exert a significant measure of control over university bancorp s affairs and policies 
this control could be used  for example  to help prevent an acquisition of university bancorp  precluding shareholders from possibly realizing any possible premium that may be offered for the common stock by a potential acquirer 
your ownership of the company may be further diluted if the bank requires additional capital there can be no assurance that the bank will not need additional capital in the future to support the bank s growth or to counter operating losses 
funds necessary to meet the bank s working capital needs and to finance its expansion might not be available 
if additional equity securities are needed to finance future expansion  such sale could result in significant dilution to the existing shareholders 
university bank has incurred significant start up losses and may never achieve sustained profitability university bank s operations were relocated to ann arbor in university bank has a history of losses and prior to incurred substantial operating losses 
shareholders are subject to the risks inherent in starting a new business 
the bank s future profitability is not assured 
management of the bank believes that as the size of loan portfolio and retail deposits increase that the bank should become more profitable  but there is no assurance that expenses will not rise at a faster rate than expected as the bank grows 
there is no assurance that university bank will grow to a size that will enable it to sustain profitability 
university bancorp had an accumulated deficit of  at december  the small size of university bank limits its ability to compete with larger financial institutions university bank faces strong competition for deposits  loans and other financial services from numerous michigan and out of state banks  thrifts  credit unions and other financial institutions 
some of the financial institutions with which university bank competes with are not subject to the same degree of regulation as university bank is 
many of these financial institutions aggressively compete for business in the ann arbor area 
most of the bank s competitors have been in business for many years  have established customer bases  have numerous branches  have substantially higher lending limits  and offer certain services that we do not provide 
the dominant competitors in the ann arbor area are tcf national bank  national city bank  comerica bank  bank one and key bank 
there can be no assurance that university bank will be able to compete effectively with these competitors unless it can continue to grow its operations 
the year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and summary of results of operations the company s net income from operations was  versus a net loss of  in and  in earnings loss per share from continuing operations for  and were  and  respectively 
the operations of the company again showed significant progress in as compared to net income increased over the results

other income rose by  the operations of midwest loan services contributed significantly to this category as their loan servicing and mortgage origination activity exceeded the prior year 
the increase in income was offset partially by an increase in the company s non interest expenses 
non interest expenses increased by  from increased salary and benefits at midwest accounted of the majority of the rise in other expense 
midwest hired additional personnel in to manage the higher levels of loan servicing and origination 
twelve months ended december  and pre tax income loss summary community banking  midwest loan services merchant banking michigan bidco corporate office total barring four sizeable non recurring items  both university bancorp and the bank would have made a profit for the entire year 
those non recurring items were midwest servicing rights valuation  bank foreclosed real estate valuation  bank non cash stock compensation  bank bidco loss  bancorp the following non recurring items negatively impacted the bank s result midwest servicing rights valuation 
the bank s midwest loan services subsidiary took a writedown on its servicing rights of  because long term rates temporarily dipped to year lows immediately following the terrorist attacks in september once written down the servicing rights cannot be written up under generally accepted accounting principles even though long term rates did subsequently rise 
the write down reduced midwest s basis in servicing rights to  from  the risk in the remaining rights is effectively offset by a principal only mortgage backed security investment that increased income during by  foreclosed real estate valuation 
in early  management engaged an experienced real estate company to develop an other real estate owned site carried on the bank s books 
during  the bank wrote down its investment in this property to  incurring a  loss 
substantially all approvals for the proposed development have been received and the bank anticipates closing on the sale of the property at the contracted price of  stock compensation expense 
the bank expensed  in non cash compensation expense related to an incentive we provided as a hiring bonus to a new executive officer in the total of these non recurring items is  without these items  the bank s income would have been  in bidco loss 
in addition  the bank holding company took a write down on its investment in michigan bidco of  to  as a result of several factors including the writedown of one investment  and research and development expense related to two e payment patents that were applied for during the year

while community banking experienced a decline in interest on loans during the record low interest rate environment of the past year  it enjoyed a increase in interest on securities and a savings in interest expense

provision for loan losses the bank charges to operations a provision for possible loan losses which is intended to create an allowance for future loan losses inherent in the bank s portfolio 
each year s provision reflects management s analysis of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for possible loan losses at a level adequate to absorb anticipated losses 
in its evaluation  management considers factors like historical loan loss experience  specifically identified problem loans  composition and growth of the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions  and other pertinent factors 
a loan is charged off by management as a loss when deemed uncollectible  although collection efforts continue and future recoveries may occur 
non performing loans are defined as loans which have been placed on non accrual status and loans over days past due as to principal or interest and still in an accrual status 
where serious doubt exists as to the collectibility of a loan  the accrual of interest is discontinued 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding impaired and past due loans 
non performing loans amounted to  and  at december  and  respectively 
during  management noted a decrease in delinquencies primarily due to a more aggressive collection effort 
the provision for loan losses in was  an increase of  from the level  which in turn was in down from the level of  loans charged off  net of recoveries  were   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in net loans charged off from to resulted primarily to loans charged off in late that relate to long standing problem loan relationships that were specifically reserved  but not charged off  in prior year periods 
the allowance for possible loan losses totaled   and  at the end of  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes the loan loss expense for the bank for the years ended december   and analysis of the allowance for loan losses amounts in thousands balance at beginning of the period chargeoffs domestic commercial loans real estate mortgage installment loans subtotal recoveries domestic commercial loans real estate mortgage installment loans subtotal net chargeoffs provision for loan losses balance at end of period ratio of net chargeoffs during period to average loans outstanding during period analysis of the allowance for loan losses amounts in thousands allocated portion of allowance percentage of loans in each at december category to total loans loan category domestic commercial loans real estate mortgages installment loans unallocated n a n a at at december  december  total loans   reserve for loan losses   reserve loans excludes loans held for sale 
the bank s overall loan portfolio is geographically concentrated in ann arbor and the future performance of these loans is dependent upon the performance of relatively limited geographical areas 
as a result of the ongoing business depression  the bank s future loss ratios may exceed historical loss ratios 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio  although the ultimate adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is dependent upon future economic factors beyond our control 
a downturn in the general nationwide economy will tend to aggravate  for example  the problems of local loan customers currently facing some difficulties 
a general nationwide business expansion could result in fewer loan customers being unable to repay their loans 
non interest income and non interest expense non interest income 
non interest income was million in compared to million in activity throughout the year was brisk at midwest loan services 
the bank s wholly owned insurance and investment subsidiary  university insurance investment services  also enjoyed a record year  producing  in fee income compared to  for the year ended december   a increase 
money under fee management in the brokerage side of the agency increased to over million during the year 
non interest income increased to in from in  an increase of 
the increase in was mainly the result of increased revenues from midwest loan services loan subservicing and set up fees  which more than offset a decline in income from merchant banking bidco income  because the bidco s results were deconsolidated after may  mortgage banking

in  midwest originated  mortgage loans  an increase of 
growth was consistent in each month throughout the year 
in the fourth quarter of  a new record of mortgages were originated by midwest 
mortgage banking  servicing and origination fees increased from  in to  in the increase in mortgage banking fee income was the result of an increase in the number of loans subserviced at midwest loan services 
the increases in mortgage banking fee income for was the result of an increase in the number of loans subserviced at midwest loan services 
during  midwest loan services increased its mortgage subservicing contracts by from billion to billion as a result of a new business relationship with one of the top five mortgage banking firms on wall street 
during the first half of  midwest reached a peak of billion in family residential loan servicing 
in the third quarter of the year  the loan servicing volume was significantly cut back as midwest s largest customer decided to significantly scale back the amount of business it was providing to midwest 
as of july    loans or of the mortgages sub serviced by midwest for this customer had been transferred to other sub servicers including a subsidiary of this firm with the rest transferred the following month 
during midwest increased its emphasis on mortgage loan originations through its credit union customers 
much of the increase in loan set up and other fees resulted from fee income from mortgage originations generated from member of credit unions

non interest expense for the quarter ended december  was million compared to million for the fourth quarter in the prior year 
year end employee performance bonuses increased the fourth quarter non operating expenses as well 
the increase was primarily the result of increased operational expenses at midwest loan services  and an increase in state small business tax and the start up of the business manager product at community banking  which more than offset cost control efforts in other areas at community banking 
during the year community banking s non interest expenses increased by  or to  from  and all of the increase was caused by the two categories mentioned above 
midwest s operations were expanded in due to a substantial increase in mortgage sub servicing and origination activity

as the volume expanded midwest increased its workforce to perform the required tasks 
other servicing and sub servicing related expenses  such as occupancy  supplies and postage increased also 
at the bank level  a concerted effort was made to reduce its non interest expenses 
notable improvements were made in the legal and audit expense category 
non interest expense was also impacted by an increase in the amortization of the mortgage servicing rights due to the low interest rate environment after september liquidity and capital resources our total assets at december  amounted to million compared to million at december  loans receivable  net of reserves and including loans held for sale  decreased by million to million from million

university bank  as an fdic insured bank  is subject to certain regulations that require the maintenance of minimum liquidity levels of cash and eligible investments 
the bank has historically exceeded this minimum as a result of its investments in federal funds sold  us government and us agency securities and cash 
in addition  university bancorp had  in cash and equity securities at the end of to meet cash needs  primarily operating expenses and interest and principal reductions on the university bancorp s note payable 
the balance of the loan was  and  at year end and the note is a fully amortizing loan maturing in early management intends that the cash and securities on hand and possible dividends from the bank to the university bancorp to be sufficient to cover the required principal reductions during on university bancorp s loan 
during  university bancorp raised working capital by issuing equity conversion notes  which bear interest at prime rate although all payment of interest is deferred until conversion into common stock or redemption 
notes are redeemable only through the proceeds of a future sale of common stock or preferred stock

market risk impact of inflation the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
since our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general effects of inflation 
however  to the extent that inflation affects interest rates  it also affects our net income 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all financial institutions are significantly affected by fluctuations in interest rates commonly referred to as interest rate risk 
the principal exposure of a financial institution s earnings to interest rate risk is the difference in time between interest rate adjustments or maturities on interest earning assets compared to the time between interest rate adjustments or maturities on interest bearing liabilities 
this difference is commonly referred to as a financial institution s gap position 
in periods when interest rates are increasing  a negative gap position will result in generally lower earnings as long term assets are repricing upward slower than short term liabilities 
however during a declining rate environment  the opposite effect on earnings is true  with earnings rising due to long term assets repricing downward slower than short term liabilities 
rising long term and short term interest rates tend to increase the value of midwest loan services investment in mortgage servicing rights and improve midwest loan services current return on these rights by lowering required amortization rates on the rights and decreasing the opportunity for customers to refinance those loans 
rising interest rates tend to decrease new mortgage origination activity  negatively impacting current income from the bank s retail mortgage banking operations and midwest s mortgage banking operations 
rising interest rates also slow midwest loan services rate of growth  but increases the duration of its existing mortgages being subserviced under contract 
the bank s securities portfolio is designed to offset a portion of the market value risk associated with the servicing rights 
during period of declining interest rates  the estimated duration period for the bank s fnma cmo tends to shorten  thus accelerating the income from the accretion of the bond s discount 
this income mitigates the rapid amortization of the servicing rights 
in a rising rate environment  the accretion of income on the bond tends to lessen

securities fair values are based on quoted market prices or  if no quotes are available  on the rate and term of the security and on information about the issuer 
for fixed rate loans or deposits and for variable rate loan or deposits with infrequent repricing or repricing limits  the fair value is estimated by the discounted cash flow analysis using current market rates for the estimated life and credit risk 
fair values for impaired loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses of underlying collateral values  where applicable 
fair value of loans held for sale is based on market estimates
