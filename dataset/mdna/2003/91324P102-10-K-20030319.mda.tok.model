expansion and divestiture of operations we continually evaluate expansion opportunities and  in the normal course of business  often consider whether to sell certain businesses or stop offering certain products or services 
expansion opportunities may include acquiring businesses that are complementary to our existing operations 
during  we completed several acquisitions and ceased offering some products in certain markets  all as part of our ongoing emphasis on our strategic focus 
further  we devote significant attention to internally developing new products and services for the health and well being sector as we have broadly defined it 
government regulation most of our health and well being services are regulated 
this regulation can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
federal and state regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered  and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically 

table of contents these revisions could affect our consolidated operations and financial results 
enactment of federal and state health benefit laws and regulations can also affect our businesses 
federal regulation our health care services segment  which includes unitedhealthcare  ovations  and americhoice  has medicare choice contracts that are regulated by cms 
cms has the right to audit our performance in order to determine compliance with cms contracts and regulations and the quality of care being given to members 
our health care services segment also has medicaid and state children s health insurance program contracts that are subject to federal and state regulation regarding services to be provided to medicaid enrollees  payment for those services  and other aspects of these programs 
we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable regulations  however  the significant level of regulations surrounding medicare and medicaid makes compliance in this product line a continuing challenge 
state regulation all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and health maintenance products regulate those products and operations 
most states require periodic financial reports from us and impose minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements 
many of our health plans and each of our insurance subsidiaries are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations 
such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain inter company transactions and general business operations 
some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material inter company transfers of assets  as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates 
in addition  some of our subsidiaries or products may be subject to ppo  managed care organization mco or tpa related regulations and licensure requirements 
these regulations differ greatly from state to state  but generally contain network  contracting  financial and reporting requirements 
many states also have enacted laws and or adopted regulations governing utilization review and external appeals activities  and these laws may apply to some of our operations 
additionally  there are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services  prompt payment of claims  confidentiality of consumer health information and covered benefits and services 
to date  these various laws and regulations have not materially affected our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
hipaa the administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of  as amended hipaa  apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets  including self funded employee benefit plans 
federal regulations promulgated pursuant to hipaa are now effective  with compliance required by april these regulations include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets  and for the privacy and security of protected health information 
we are currently in compliance with these regulations 
new standards for national provider and employer identifiers are currently being developed by regulators 
we intend to be in compliance by the enforcement dates  however  the law is far reaching and complex and the government s delay in providing guidance on some aspects of the law may affect the timeliness of our compliance efforts 
additionally  different approaches to hipaa s provisions and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines 
erisa the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employer sponsored health benefit plans 
erisa is a complex set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the united states department of labor as well as the federal courts 
erisa places controls on how our business 
table of contents units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans  particularly those that maintain self funded plans 
during  we processed and administered the payment of approximately billion of medical claims on behalf of customers that self insure the medical costs of their employees and their employees dependents 
new erisa claim regulations which became effective july require ongoing modifications to our operations 
we believe that we are in compliance with the new regulations 
fraud and abuse the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in federal government health care programs such as medicare and medicaid are complex and changing 
we continue to emphasize our regulatory compliance efforts for these programs  but ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical nature of the regulations mean that compliance efforts in this arena will continue to require significant resources 
additionally  states have begun to focus their anti fraud efforts on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations 
some states now require filing and approval of anti fraud plans and may monitor compliance as part of any market conduct examination 
audits and investigations we are regularly subject to governmental audits  investigations and enforcement actions 
any such government actions can result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs 
in addition  a state department of insurance or other state or federal authority including cms  the office of the inspector general and state attorneys general may from time to time begin a special audit of one of our health plans  our insurance plans and products or one of our other operations to investigate issues such as utilization management  financial  eligibility or other data reporting  prompt claims payment  or coverage of medically necessary care  including emergency room care 
we are currently involved in various governmental investigations  audits and reviews 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by cms  state insurance departments and state attorneys general  the office of personnel management  the office of the inspector general and us attorneys 
we do not believe the results of any of the current investigations  audits or reviews  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
international regulation our ingenix and health care services segments both have limited international operations 
these international operations are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions  including various tax  tariff and trade regulations  as well as employment  intellectual property and investment rules and laws 
marketing our marketing strategy is defined and coordinated by each business s dedicated marketing staff 
within these businesses  primary marketing responsibility generally resides with a marketing leader and a direct sales force 
in addition  several of the segments also rely upon independent insurance agents and brokers to sell some of their products 
marketing efforts also include public relations efforts and advertising programs that may use television  radio  newspapers  magazines  billboards  direct mail and telemarketing 
competition as a diversified health and well being services company we operate in highly competitive markets 
our competitors include managed health care companies  insurance companies  tpas and business services outsourcing companies  health care providers that have formed networks to directly contract with employers  specialty benefit providers  government entities  and various information and consulting 
table of contents companies 
new entrants into the markets in which we compete  as well as consolidation within these markets  also contribute to this competitive environment 
we believe the principal competitive factors affecting us and the sales and pricing of our products and services include product innovation  consumer satisfaction  the level and quality of products and services  network capabilities  price  market share  product distribution systems  efficient administration operations  financial strength and marketplace reputation 
we believe that our competitive strengths are enhanced by our customer focus resulting from our operational alignment 
each unitedhealth group business represents a strategic platform from which we can penetrate more deeply into specific markets using our three core competencies network management  knowledge and information and service infrastructure 
other strengths include the breadth and quality of our products  our geographic scope and diversity  the scope and depth of our data and information about health care costs and consumption  our effective use of proprietary tools and products to coordinate and facilitate programs designed to realize appropriately lower health care costs  our disciplined underwriting and pricing practices and staff  our significant market position in certain geographic areas  the strength of our distribution network  our financial strength  our generally large provider networks that provide more consumer choice and minimize barriers to access  our point of service products and our strong marketplace reputation 
however  in some markets we may be at a disadvantage for a number of reasons  including competitors with more resources  longer operating histories  larger market shares  broader networks  narrower networks which may allow greater cost control and lower prices or more established names and reputations 
these competitive factors could adversely affect our business and operating results 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  individuals 
we believe our employee relations are good 
cautionary statements the statements contained in this annual report on form k  and in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of our annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in this form k  include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra 
when used in this annual report on form k and in future filings by us with the securities and exchange commission  in our press releases  presentations to securities analysts or investors  and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers  the words or phrases believes  anticipates  intends  will likely result  estimates  projects or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider 
this discussion is intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra 
except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws  in making these cautionary statements  we do not undertake to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results  and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications 
in addition  any of the matters discussed below may have affected our past  as well as current  forward looking statements about future results 
any or all forward looking statements in this form k  in the annual report to shareholders  and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed 
actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in our prior communications 

table of contents health care costs we use a large portion of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our customers 
accordingly  the profitability of our risk based products depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict  price for  and effectively manage health care costs 
total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service 
our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a month period and is generally priced three months before contract commencement 
services are delivered and related costs are incurred when the contract commences 
although we base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period  inflation  regulations and other factors may cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums 
these factors may include increased use of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  the introduction of new or costly treatments  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use 
relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results because of the relatively narrow operating margins of our risk based arrangements 
in addition  the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which the underlying claims have not been received by us or for which the claims have been received but not processed 
if these estimates prove too high or too low  our earnings may be adjusted later based on actual costs 
industry factors the health and well being industries receive significant negative publicity and have been the subject of large jury verdicts 
this publicity has been accompanied by litigation  legislative activity  regulation and governmental review of industry practices 
these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services  may require us to change our products and services  and may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate  further increasing our costs of doing business and adversely affecting our profitability 
competition in many of our geographic or product markets  we compete with a number of other entities  some of which may have certain characteristics or capabilities that give them a competitive advantage 
we believe the barriers to entry in certain markets are not substantial  so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily  and consumers enjoy significant flexibility in moving to competitors 
some of our customers may decide to perform for themselves functions or services we provide  which would decrease our revenues 
some of our contracted physicians and other health care providers may decide to market products and services to our customers in competition with us 
in addition  significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industry in which we operate as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us  such as the hospital  physician  pharmaceutical  medical device and health information systems industries 
to the extent that there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in any market  our ability to retain or increase customers or contracted physicians and other health care providers  or maintain or increase our revenue growth  pricing flexibility  control over medical cost trends and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 
aarp contract under our long term contract with aarp  we provide medicare supplement and hospital indemnity health insurance and other products to aarp members 
as of december   our portion of aarp s insurance program represented approximately billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately million aarp members 
the success of our aarp arrangement depends  in part  on our ability to service these customers  develop additional products and services  price the products and services competitively  and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes 
additionally  events 
table of contents that adversely affect aarp or one of its other business partners for its member insurance program could have an adverse effect on the success of our arrangement with aarp 
government programs in response to medical cost increases that exceeded medicare program reimbursement rate growth  we have withdrawn our medicare choice product offerings from a number of counties and filed significant benefit adjustments in other counties 
these and other actions have reduced medicare choice enrollment and may result in further or complete withdrawal of medicare choice product offerings  when and as permitted by our contracts with the cms 
under current regulations  we are precluded from re entering the counties from which we have withdrawn our medicare choice product offerings until two years after the effective date of withdrawal 
the financial results of our medicare choice  medicaid and state children s health insurance program schip operations depend on a number of factors  including program reimbursement increases  government regulations  benefit design  physician and other health care provider contracting  state budgetary pressures medicaid and schip and other factors 
there can be no assurance that any or all of our government program operations will be profitable in future periods 
government regulation our business is regulated at the federal  state  local and international levels 
the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations 
existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business  restrict revenue and enrollment growth  increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements  and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations  contract interpretation and other actions 
we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products  to increase prices for certain regulated products and to consummate our acquisitions and dispositions 
delays in obtaining or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs 
we participate in federal  state and local government health care coverage programs 
these programs generally are subject to frequent change  including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past and may do so in the future 
state legislatures and congress continue to focus on health care issues 
bills and regulations at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business  including contracting with physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals  physician reimbursement methods and payment rates  coverage determinations  claim payments and processing  use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information  medical malpractice litigation reform  and government sponsored programs 
we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation  or  if enacted  what their terms will be  but their enactment could increase our costs  expose us to expanded liability  require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for a loss of business to new health care funding arrangements 
we are also subject to various governmental investigations  audits and reviews 
such oversight could result in our loss of licensure or our right to participate in certain programs  or the imposition of civil or criminal fines  penalties and other sanctions 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could damage our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
we are currently involved in various governmental investigations  audits and reviews 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by the cms  state and health insurance departments and state attorneys general  the office of personnel management  the office of the inspector general and us attorneys 
although the results of pending matters are always uncertain  we do not believe the results of any of the current investigations  audits or reviews  individually 
table of contents or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries 
these companies are subject to state regulations that  among other things  may require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and may restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies 
generally  the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by our regulated subsidiaries  without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited based on the subsidiary s level of statutory net income  statutory capital and surplus 
we use cash generated from operations  commercial paper and debt to maintain adequate operating and financial flexibility 
the agencies that assess our creditworthiness also consider statutory capital levels when establishing our debt ratings 
we maintain an aggregate statutory capital level for our regulated subsidiaries that is significantly higher than the minimum level regulators require 
physician  hospital and other health care provider relations one of the significant techniques we use to contain health care costs and facilitate care delivery is to contract with physicians  hospitals  pharmaceutical benefit managers and pharmaceutical manufacturers  and other health care providers for favorable prices 
a number of organizations are advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these physicians and health care professionals from federal and state antitrust laws 
in any particular market  these physicians and health care professionals could refuse to contract  demand higher payments  or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs  less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain health care providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part 
litigation and insurance sometimes we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business  such as employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  shareholder suits  and intellectual property related litigation 
in addition  because of the nature of our businesses  we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design  management and offerings of our services 
these matters include  but are not limited to  claims related to health care benefits coverage  medical malpractice actions  contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices 
in  a number of class action lawsuits were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business 
the suits are purported class actions on behalf of certain customers and physicians for alleged breaches of federal statutes  including erisa and the racketeer influenced corrupt organization act rico 
we will incur expenses in the defense of these matters  even if they are without merit 
recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims 
in some cases  substantial non economic  treble or punitive damages may be sought 
we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities 
other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance  insurers may dispute coverage  or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded 
in addition  certain types of damages  such as punitive damages  may not be covered by insurance 
the cost of general business insurance coverage has increased significantly following the events of september  as a result  we have increased the amount of risk that we self insure  particularly with respect to routine matters incidental to our business 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self insured matters 
although we believe the liabilities established for these risks are adequate  there can be no assurance that the level of actual losses will not exceed the liabilities recorded 

table of contents data integrity and information systems our businesses depend significantly on effective information systems and the integrity of the data we use to run these businesses 
our ability to adequately price our products and services  provide effective and efficient service to our customers  and to accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems 
as a result of our acquisition activities  we have acquired additional systems 
we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities 
if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity  we could lose existing customers  have difficulty in attracting new customers  have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing  have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes  have regulatory problems  have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences 
our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving industry and regulatory standards  and changing customer preferences 
for example  the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa and the department of labor s erisa claim processing regulations require changes to our current systems 
we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systems related support  equipment  facilities  and certain data  including data center operations  data network  voice communication services and pharmacy data processing 
this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under the contract  due to internal or external factors 
although there are a limited number of service organizations with the size  scale and capabilities to effectively provide certain of these services  especially with regard to pharmacy benefits processing and management  we believe that other organizations could provide similar services on comparable terms 
a change in service providers  however  could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which could adversely affect our operating results 
proprietary information and privacy regulations the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at international  federal  state and local levels 
these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data 
most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal gramm leach bliley act and hipaa 
hipaa also imposes guidelines on our business associates as this term is defined in the hipaa regulations 
even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates  we still have limited control over their actions and practices 
compliance with these proposals and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes  the development of new administrative processes  and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates 
they also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases 
the success of our knowledge and information related businesses also depends significantly on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products 
we rely on our agreements with customers  confidentiality agreements with employees  and our trade secrets  copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights 
these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information 
in addition  substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry  and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows 
such litigation could have an adverse effect on the ability of our businesses to market and sell products and services and on our consolidated results of operations 

table of contents administration and management efficient and cost effective administration of our operations is essential to our profitability and competitive positioning 
staff related and other operating expenses may increase from time to time due to business or product start ups or expansions  growth or changes in business or the mix of products purchased by customers  acquisitions  regulatory requirements or other reasons 
unanticipated expense increases may adversely affect our financial results 
we believe we currently have an experienced  capable management and technical staff 
the market for management and technical personnel  including information systems professionals  in the health care industry is very competitive 
loss of key employees or a number of managers or technical staff could adversely affect our ability to administer and manage our business 
marketing we market our products and services through both employed sales people and independent sales agents 
the departure of key sales employees or agents or a large subset of these individuals could impair our ability to retain existing customers 
some of our customers or potential customers consider our debt ratings  accreditation or certification by various private or governmental bodies or rating agencies necessary or important 
some of our health plans or other business units may not have obtained or maintained  or may not desire or be able to obtain or maintain  such ratings  accreditation or certification  which could adversely affect our ability to obtain or acquire or retain business from these customers and potential customers 
acquisitions and dispositions we have an active ongoing acquisition and disposition program under which we may engage in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of assets  products or businesses  some or all of which may be material 
these transactions may entail risks and uncertainties and may affect ongoing business operations because of unknown liabilities  unforeseen administrative needs or the use of resources to integrate the acquired operations 
failure to identify liabilities  anticipate additional administrative needs or effectively integrate acquired operations could result in reduced revenues  increased administrative and other costs and customer dissatisfaction 
terrorist attacks the terrorist attacks launched on september   the war on terrorism  the threat of future acts of terrorism and the related concerns of customers and providers have negatively affected  and may continue to negatively affect  the us economy in general and our industry specifically 
depending on the government s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies  future acts of terrorism and bio terrorism could adversely affect us through  among other things  increased use of health care services including  without limitation  hospital and physician services  loss of membership in health plans we administer as a result of lay offs or other reductions of employment  adverse effects upon the financial condition or business of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their employees  disruption of our information and payment systems  increased health care costs due to restrictions on our ability to carve out certain categories of risk  such as acts of terrorism  and disruption of the financial and insurance markets in general 
financial outlook from time to time in press releases and otherwise  we may publish forecasts or other forward looking statements regarding our future results  including estimated revenues  earnings per share and other operating and financial metrics 
any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions 
these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties  and any number of them may prove to be incorrect 
further  the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous factors including those described in this discussion  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot assure that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be

you are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions  but instead are encouraged to utilize the entire publicly available mix of historical and forward looking information  as well as other available information affecting us and our services  when evaluating our prospective consolidated results of operations 
general economic conditions changes in economic conditions could affect our business and results of operations 
the state of the economy affects our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to increase prices in some of our businesses 
although we are continuously striving to diversify our product offerings to address the changing needs of consumers  there can be no assurance that the effects of the current or a future downturn in economic conditions will not cause our existing customers to seek health coverage alternatives that we do not offer or will not result in significant loss of customers  or decreased margins on our continuing customers 
stock market the market prices of the securities of the publicly held companies in the industry in which we operate have shown volatility and sensitivity in response to many factors  including general market trends  public communications regarding managed care  litigation and judicial decisions  legislative or regulatory actions  health care cost trends  pricing trends  competition  earnings  membership reports of particular industry participants and acquisition activity 
we cannot assure the level or stability of the price of our securities at any time or the effect of the foregoing or any other factors on such prices

item legal proceedings in september  a group of plaintiffs trial lawyers publicly announced that they were targeting the managed care industry by way of class action litigation

in re managed care litigation mdl no 
a multi district litigation panel has consolidated several litigation cases involving unitedhealth group and our affiliates in the southern district court of florida  miami division 
the first of these suits was initiated in february in december  the unitedhealth group litigation was consolidated with litigation involving other industry members for the coordination of pre trial proceedings 
the litigation has been divided into two tracks  with one track comprising consumer claims and the other health care provider claims 
generally  the claims made in this consolidated litigation allege violations of erisa and rico in connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to maximize profits 
the litigation also asserts breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims alleging that unitedhealth group affiliates fail to timely reimburse providers for medical services rendered 
the consolidated suits seek injunctive  compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution  costs  fees and interest payments 
following the court s initial decisions on industry members motions to dismiss the complaints  amended complaints were filed in both tracks 
on february   the court granted in part and denied in part the industry defendants motion to dismiss the amended complaint in the consumer track litigation 
in significant part  the court limited the rico and erisa claims that could be brought by the plaintiffs  and dismissed entirely the common law claims for civil conspiracy and unjust enrichment 
on september   the trial court denied the consumer track plaintiffs motion for class certification while granting the health care provider track plaintiffs 
table of contents certification motion

the american medical association et al 
v 
metropolitan life insurance company  united healthcare services  inc and unitedhealth group

the suit alleges causes of action based on erisa  as well as breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  deceptive acts and practices  and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non network providers 
the suit seeks declaratory  injunctive and compensatory relief as well as costs  fees and interest payments 
an amended complaint was filed on august   which alleged two classes of plaintiffs  an erisa class and a non erisa class 
after the court dismissed certain erisa claims and the claims brought by the american medical association  a third amended complaint was filed 
on october   the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint 
we are engaged in discovery in this matter

some of these suits may include claims for substantial non economic  treble or punitive damages 
we record liabilities for our estimate of probable costs resulting from these matters
