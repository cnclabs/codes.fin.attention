item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sapient  a leading business and technology consultancy  helps global clients achieve measurable business results through the rapid application and support of advanced technology  primarily on a fixed price basis 
we are focused on making technology matter sm  by identifying  implementing and supporting technology enabled solutions that create near and long term business value for our clients 
we create value for our clients through our unique approach a passion for delivering measurable business results  a fundamentally different methodology  a commitment to fixed price and fixed time delivery  our expertise in globally distributed delivery  and our ability to design our solutions for adoption 
the market for advanced technology consulting services  including our services  has declined significantly since the second half of as a result of this decrease in demand  our service revenues for the twelve months ended december  decreased from our service revenues for the twelve months ended december   and decreased from our service revenues for the twelve months ended december  our net loss from continuing operations increased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december  as a result of these losses  we reduced our work force and consolidated office space in cities where we had multiple office locations or excess office space at various times in and we also closed our australia office in and discontinued our operations in japan in december our cash used in operations for the twelve months ended december  was million and we have accrued restructuring costs  primarily related to vacated facilities  of million at december  our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable investments at december  were million 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure  restructuring and stock repurchase program requirements for at least the next months 
however  if the demand for our services remains weak or declines further  we may incur additional losses and negative cash flows  and these could be significant 
during the second half of  we began to see some stabilization in our service revenues 
during the first half of  our service revenues for the three months ended june  decreased from our service revenues for the three months ended march   following a decline of from our service revenues for the three months ended december  for the three month periods ended september  and december   however  our service revenues increased and decreased  respectively  from our service revenues during the preceding three month period 
our annualized service revenues per billable employee improved from  for the three months ended june  to  for the three months ended december  our utilization rate improved from for the three months ended june  to for the three months ended december  throughout the year  we have seen an increase in the percentage of our service revenues generated from governmental clients  both in the united states and in the united kingdom  which increased from for the three months ended march  to for the three months ended december  we expect that service revenues from governmental clients will remain significant in the near future 
on january   in a conference call announcing our financial results for the three months ended december   we estimated that our service revenues for the three months ended march  would be in the range of to million  based on our then current revenue projections  and that we would recognize a net loss for this period 
within our individual business units  we do not expect any material changes in our service revenues compared to the three months ended december  throughout  we also achieved continual reductions in our project personnel costs  before reimbursable expenses  selling and marketing costs and general and administrative costs 
our project personnel costs  before reimbursable expenses  selling and marketing costs and general and administrative costs declined to million for the three months ended december   from million for the three months ended march  as a result of our restructuring actions and other cost cutting actions  we expect to realize further cost reductions in on january   in a conference call announcing our financial 
table of contents results for the three months ended december   we estimated that these costs for the three months ended march  would be in the range of to million 
although we believe we are seeing signs of stabilization in our business  the economic outlook is still uncertain 
we believe that technology spending by large companies will remain weak over the next several quarters and we cannot predict when the market for technology consulting services will significantly improve 
when the market does improve  we cannot predict whether  and to what extent  the demand for our services will increase 
any decline in our service revenues will have a significant impact on our financial results  particularly because a significant portion of our operating costs such as personnel  rent and depreciation are fixed in advance of a particular quarter 
as a result  despite cost savings realized from our restructuring plans  our costs for project personnel  sales and marketing and general and administrative could continue to increase as a percentage of revenues  thereby affecting our operating results 
our global distributed delivery sm gdd methodology continues to increase in importance  both as a percentage of our projects and as a percentage of our service revenues 
we created this proprietary methodology in  which allows us to provide high quality solutions within accelerated hour delivery time frames  by utilizing india s highly skilled technology specialists  lower costs and the time differences between india and the countries we serve 
we also employ our gdd methodology to provide support and maintenance 
throughout the year  we saw an increase in our utilization rate relating to people based in india  from for the three months ended march  to for the three months ended december  we expect utilization rates in india to continue to increase in the first quarter of for the twelve months ended december   projects with a gdd component accounted for of our total service revenues  compared to for the twelve months ended december  our future segment and overall company revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the number  size and scope of projects in which we are engaged  the contractual terms and degree of completion of such projects  any delays incurred in connection with a project  employee utilization rates  the adequacy of provisions for losses  the use of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  general economic conditions and other factors 
in addition  revenues from a large project or client may constitute a significant portion of our total revenues in a particular quarter 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
a summary of those accounting policies that we believe are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we recognize revenue from the provision of professional services under written service contracts with our clients 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from fixed price  fixed time contracts 
revenue generated from fixed price contracts  with the exception of support and maintenance contracts  is recognized based on the ratio of labor hours incurred to estimated total labor hours 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made  based on historical experience and milestones set in the contract 
revenue generated from fixed price support and maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the contract term 
revenue from time 
table of contents and materials contracts is recognized as services are provided 
our project delivery and business unit finance personnel continually review labor hours incurred and estimated total labor hours  which may result in revisions to the amount of recognized revenue for a contract 
certain contracts provide for revenue to be generated based upon the achievement of certain performance standards 
revenue will be recognized when those performance standards are achieved 
no revenue has been recognized to date for performance standards 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed for a contract or we do not manage the project properly within the planned time period  then we may recognize a loss on the contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made on a contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined 
we have committed unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has resulted in lower than anticipated profitability or losses on those contracts 
we expect that we will experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the process  which could result in a fixed price that turns out to be too low and  therefore  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in some instances during and  we provided services to clients in exchange for equity instruments of the client 
we measure the fair value of the equity instrument on the date the parties come to a mutual understanding of the terms of the arrangement and a commitment for performance by us to earn the equity instruments is reached  or when the equity is earned  whichever occurs earlier 
we did not receive any equity for services rendered for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and   and million  respectively  of equity was received for services rendered 
we recognize revenue for services where collection from the client is probable 
we establish billing terms at the time project deliverables and milestones are agreed 
our normal payment terms are days from invoice date 
earnings recognized in excess of the amounts invoiced to clients are classified as unbilled revenues 
amounts invoiced to clients in excess of revenue recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
our project delivery and business unit finance personnel continually monitor timely payments from our clients and assess any collection issues 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we base our estimates on our historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit policy  detailed analysis of specific client situations and percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances we established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
this pronouncement requires that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred be characterized as revenue in our statement of operations 
we incur incidental expenses in the delivery of services to our clients that are commonly referred to as out of pocket expenses 
these expenses include  but are not limited to  travel and related charges 
accordingly  we adjusted revenue for all periods reported to include the reimbursable expenses billed to clients 
previously  these expense reimbursements were classified as a reduction of project personnel costs 
this change in classification had no effect on current or previously reported net income loss or net income loss per share 
accounting for income taxes 
we record income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their 
table of contents respective income tax bases  and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
our financial statements contain fully reserved deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of net operating losses incurred in and  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of net operating losses incurred in and  anticipated additional net operating losses for the first quarter of and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  we have continued to record a full valuation allowance  which was approximately million as of december  the establishment and amount of the valuation allowance requires significant estimates and judgment and can materially affect our results of operations 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction and as a result of acquisitions 
valuation of long lived assets 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if such circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill  to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
in determining expected future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
we determined that an interim impairment test of long lived assets at june  was necessary due to the significant decline in our market capitalization  as determined by our stock price 
we determined as a result of this test that the expected undiscounted cash flows related to our long lived asset groups would not recover the carrying value of the assets over their remaining useful lives 
accordingly  we compared the carrying amounts of our long lived assets to their estimated fair values 
fair values were estimated using methods such as estimated replacement cost and relief from royalty 
based on the analysis at june   the fair values of certain intangible assets were below their carrying values and an impairment charge of million was recognized in the statement of operations under the caption impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the twelve months ended december  the valuation of long lived assets requires significant estimates and assumptions  including fair value estimates such as estimated replacement cost and relief from royalty 
these estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
if different estimates or adjustments were used  it is reasonably possible that our analysis would have generated materially different results 

table of contents in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  beginning january   we ceased amortization of goodwill  which was approximately million at that time 
we performed an impairment review of our goodwill as of january   under the transitional provisions of sfas we identified our reporting units  allocated assets and liabilities to the reporting units and performed impairment tests on the goodwill associated with each of the reporting units by comparing the reporting units book value to their estimated fair value 
assets and liabilities  including goodwill  were allocated to reporting units based on factors such as specific identification  percentage of revenue and headcount 
the fair value of the reporting units was estimated considering a market multiple of revenue approach 
during the three months ended june   we completed the transitional impairment test of goodwill and concluded that no impairment of the goodwill had occurred as of january  by june   our stock price had declined significantly from january   at which point our market capitalization  based on our stock price  was below our book value  and we determined that an interim goodwill impairment test should be performed 
our stock price at january  was per share and declined to per share at june  based on the analysis at june   the carrying amount of all reporting units exceeded their fair values and a goodwill impairment charge of million  representing of the goodwill balance  was recognized in the statement of operations under the caption impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the twelve months ended december  the valuation of long lived assets requires significant estimates and assumptions  including fair value estimates of reporting units based on a market multiple of revenue approach 
these estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
if different estimates or adjustments were used  it is reasonably possible that our analysis would have generated materially different results 
restructuring and other related charges 
we established exit plans for each of the restructuring activities which took place in and and accounted for these plans in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
we specifically identified all employees whose employment was to be terminated and notified them prior to the end of the quarter in which the related restructuring charge was recorded 
the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates  including contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for office space being vacated and related costs  leasehold improvement write downs  offset by estimated sub lease income 
we review on at least a quarterly basis our sub lease assumptions 
these estimates include anticipated rates to be charged to a sub tenant and the timing of the sub lease arrangement 
we changed our original estimates in and the fourth quarter of due to changing real estate markets  which resulted in net additional restructuring charges 
during the third quarter of  we recognized a restructuring credit  which primarily related to savings in outplacement services and facility costs 
if the rental markets continue to change  our sub lease assumptions may not be accurate and it is possible that changes in these estimates would materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our remaining cash lease commitments related to restructured facilities are approximately million  of which is accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  and the remaining relates to sub lease assumptions 
we have entered into signed sub lease arrangements for approximately million  with the remaining million for future estimated sub lease arrangements 
if the estimated sub lease dates were to be extended by six months  based on our current estimates  we would potentially have to recognize an additional million in our statement of operations for restructuring and other related charges 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
it supersedes the guidance in eitf issue no 
under eitf  an entity recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date that the entity committed itself to an exit plan 
in sfas  an entity s commitment to a plan does not  by itself  create a present obligation to other parties that meets the definition of a liability 
sfas also establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial measurement of the 
table of contents liability 
sfas will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   however  we will continue to follow the guidance of eitf no 
for any changes in our restructuring estimates for the initiatives implemented in and contingent liabilities 
we have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
we accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated 
we are subject to various pending or threatened legal claims and administrative audits which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business 
we have an accrual at december  of approximately  related to those items that remain outstanding 
the ultimate outcome of these items is uncertain and the potential loss  if any  may be significantly higher or lower than amounts previously accrued by us 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements  other than our owned joint venture in milan  italy 
see equity investments in this part ii  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a more detailed discussion of this joint venture 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
effect of certain transactions acquisitions we have consummated three acquisitions during the past three years 
these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases  and  accordingly  the purchase price for each acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
the results of operations for each acquired company are included in our consolidated statement of operations from the date of acquisition 
the following are details for each of these acquisitions on october   we consummated an agreement to acquire the launch group aktiengesellschaft tlg  a provider of strategy and business consulting services in germany 
in connection with the acquisition  we invested approximately million in cash directly into tlg  issued approximately  shares of our common stock to selling shareholders  and issued approximately  shares of our common stock to the former tlg employees continuing with the company 
these shares are restricted and subject to vesting based on continued employment with the company 
the restricted shares had a value of million upon issuance  and are being amortized over the vesting period of years 
approximately million of deferred compensation relating to these restricted shares has been reversed due to employees leaving the company prior to vesting 
on august   we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of human code  inc human code in exchange for approximately  shares of our common stock and options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock  and direct acquisition costs of approximately million 
in   shares were returned to sapient upon the resolution of an indemnification claim asserted by us pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement 
these shares were valued at approximately  the fair value of the shares on the date that the former human code shareholders agreed to the return of the shares  and were recorded as a reduction to goodwill 
prior to the acquisition  options to purchase approximately  shares of human code common stock were outstanding at exercise prices between and per share 
as a result of the acquisition  we assumed these outstanding human code stock options and converted them into options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock at exercise prices between and per share 
the options vest ratably over periods up to four years 
we recorded deferred compensation of 
table of contents million related to the intrinsic value of the unvested options 
approximately million of deferred compensation has been reversed due to employees leaving the company prior to vesting 
on june   we invested million in hwt  inc hwt  formerly healthwatch technologies  llc in connection with a reorganization of hwt 
as a result of this investment and reorganization  our equity ownership of hwt increased to approximately  which resulted in us assuming control of hwt as of that date 
prior to the reorganization  we had a less than  non controlling ownership interest in hwt and accounted for this investment using the equity method of accounting 
our consolidated statements of operations include the results of operations of hwt from the date of this additional investment 
on january   we increased our ownership percentage in hwt to by purchasing a total of  shares of hwt common stock from jerry a 
greenberg and j 
stuart moore  our co chairmen and co ceos  for a total purchase price of  in cash 
the purchase price per share paid to messrs 
greenberg and moore was  which represented a substantial loss from their cost basis per share of 
messrs 
greenberg and moore are no longer shareholders of hwt 
we also commenced a tender offer on january  to purchase the remaining shares of hwt  for per share  in cash 
the tender offer period expired on february  as a result of the tender offer  we purchased a total of  shares of hwt common stock  for a total purchase price of  and our ownership percentage in hwt increased from to 
prior to engaging in the above referenced transactions  our board of directors first obtained an independent valuation of the fair market value of hwt s common stock 
the valuation firm concluded that the fair market value of each share of hwt common stock was between per share and per share 
after considering this valuation  our board of directors decided to offer to pay for each outstanding share of hwt common stock in the tender offer  and per share for each outstanding share of hwt common stock owned by messrs 
greenberg and moore 
the board of directors believed that the per share price for messrs 
greenberg and moore was advisable to counter any perception that messrs 
greenberg and moore received a favorable price for their hwt shares because of their positions as executive officers and directors of sapient 
the board then obtained a fairness opinion  in which the valuation firm opined that the and purchase prices were fair  from a financial point of view  to the shareholders of sapient 
the firm did not express any opinion as to whether the or purchase prices were fair to the shareholders of hwt or messrs 
greenberg and moore  respectively 
we engaged in the above described transactions for two reasons 
first  we believe that hwt continues to be a good strategic fit with our long term business objectives 
by increasing our ownership in hwt  we are able to more closely align hwt s business  financial results and executive management with sapient 
second  we purchased all of the hwt shares owned by messrs 
greenberg and moore in order to eliminate any appearance of a potential conflict of interest that might be deemed to arise from messrs 
greenberg and moore owning stock of both hwt and sapient  while also serving as sapient s co chairmen and co ceos 
although we do not believe that their ownership of hwt shares has presented any actual conflict of interest to date  we wanted to avoid the possibility of any such conflict arising in the future 
equity investments on october   we invested million in dream incubator  inc di  a management consulting company that develops strategies for e businesses in japan  and acquired a interest 
under the terms of our investment agreement with di  we had a seat on di s board of directors  with special voting rights and other privileges  and we therefore used the equity method of accounting for this investment 
during the year ended december   our equity ownership percentage in di was diluted from to approximately due to the sale by di of shares to new investors 
in may  our equity ownership percentage in di was further diluted from approximately to approximately  as a result of a public offering of di s common stock 
both rounds of financing were at a higher price per share than we previously paid and we 
table of contents recorded gains of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  as a result of the change in equity interest 
on october   di acquired a equity interest in sapient kk  our japanese subsidiary  for million in cash 
the excess cash payment of  over our carrying value of sapient kk was recorded as a component of stockholders equity  due to the start up nature of sapient kk 
di provided sapient kk with start up services including strategy  temporary management  recruiting and other services 
prior to this transaction  we owned of this subsidiary 
we incurred costs of approximately   and  in start up services provided by di to sapient kk for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we discontinued our sapient kk operations in japan 
on november   as part of the dissolution of sapient kk  the company and di agreed to unwind the cross ownership position between di and sapient kk  in exchange for di lifting certain trading restrictions on its common stock owned by us 
we transferred approximately  shares of di  having a fair market value of approximately million  to di  in return for di s transfer to us of di s minority interest in sapient kk 
under the regulations of the tokyo stock exchange  we were required to make a cash payment of approximately million to di for the sapient kk shares being transferred to us 
the payment was then transferred back to us by di for the di shares being transferred to di 
this cash payment for the minority interest became part of our investment basis in sapient kk  which was reduced to zero upon dissolution of sapient kk and is included in our loss from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  in addition  our designee on di s board of directors resigned his position as a director of di 
di is a public company traded in japan  and we are selling our remaining shares of di common stock as market conditions permit 
as of december   we sold  shares of the  remaining shares that we owned after the unwinding of the cross ownership  resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately  and a gain of approximately  as of november  we will use the cost method of accounting for this investment  because we no longer have the ability to significantly influence di 
after that date  any gains or losses recognized on the sale of shares from this investment or any write down of the investment due to the decline in the value of the investment below its book value that is considered other than temporary will be included as non operating income loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
in september  we commenced a joint venture  sapient spa  in milan  italy 
the joint venture provides business and technology consulting in italy 
we own of the voting stock of this joint venture and use the equity method of accounting because we have the ability to significantly influence  but not control  the joint venture 
we had call option rights to purchase one additional share in january and january at a price equal to its nominal value  which were not exercised 
we also have the option to purchase the remaining ownership interests in the joint venture in january and each quarter of at a price determined using a formula based on an appraised fair market value and a multiple of projected earnings 
we cannot be sure when  or if  we will exercise these remaining options 
during  and  we recognized approximately  million and million  respectively  in net revenues from consulting services provided to sapient spa  in accordance with the joint venture agreement 
in addition to recognizing revenue  we reduced general and administrative expenses by approximately   and  for start up and administrative services billed to the joint venture during  and  respectively 
at december   we had receivables due from sapient spa  of approximately  we had no net receivables due from this entity at december  we originally invested approximately million in the joint venture 
due to losses incurred by sapient spa since its inception  our investment balance was reduced to zero during the second half of in the future there may be changes to our equity investment and  if gain or loss recognition is appropriate  the amount will be recognized as non operating income loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
related party transactions on january   we entered into a strategic relationship with a client which included  among other things  our becoming a preferred supplier to that client and its affiliated entities 
as part of the relationship  our co ceos and co chairmen of the board of directors each issued a million convertible note to the client 
the notes were convertible into shares of our common stock owned by the co ceos and co chairmen 
table of contents at a conversion rate equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date the convertible notes were executed 
the client s ability to convert the notes was subject to certain vesting restrictions  based upon the client s payment of certain levels of consulting revenues to sapient within prescribed time frames 
during the three months ended june   our co ceos and co chairmen of the board of directors each repaid these notes in full 
the client had not converted any portion of the notes into shares of our common stock prior to the repayment and there are no future conversion rights which remain in existence

the decrease in amortization of intangible assets for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily related to the cessation of amortization of goodwill as of january   in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we recorded approximately million of amortization of goodwill for the twelve months ended december  we performed an impairment review of our goodwill as of january   under the transitional provisions of sfas we identified our reporting units  allocated assets and liabilities to the reporting units and performed impairment tests on the net goodwill associated with each of the reporting units by comparing the reporting units book value to their estimated fair value 
assets and liabilities  including goodwill  were allocated to reporting units based on factors such as specific identification  percentage of revenue and headcount 
the fair value of the reporting units was estimated considering a market multiple of revenue approach 
during the three months ended june   we completed the transitional impairment test of goodwill as of january   concluding that no impairment of the goodwill had occurred at that date 
by june   our stock price had declined significantly from january   at which point our market capitalization  based on our stock price  was below our book value  and we determined that an interim goodwill impairment test should be performed 
based on our analysis at june   the carrying amount of all reporting units exceeded their fair values and a goodwill impairment charge of million was recognized in the statement of operations under the caption impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  for the twelve months ended december  this charge represented of the goodwill balance at january  our japanese subsidiary did not have intangible assets and therefore goodwill amortization had no effect on discontinued operations 
the following is a summary of reported income loss from continuing operations and basic and diluted income loss per share from continuing operations for the twelve months ended december   and as adjusted to remove the amortization of goodwill in thousands  except per share amounts years ended december  reported income loss from continuing operations add back goodwill amortization adjusted income loss from continuing operations basic income loss per share from continuing operations reported basic income loss per share from continuing operations goodwill amortization adjusted basic income loss per share from continuing operations

utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for each long lived asset group  we determined that the expected undiscounted cash flows related to our long lived asset groups would not recover the carrying value of the assets over their remaining useful lives 
accordingly  we compared the carrying amounts of our long lived assets to their estimated fair values 
fair values were estimated using methods such as estimated replacement cost and relief from royalty 
based on the analysis at june   the fair values of certain intangible assets were below their carrying values and an impairment charge of million was recognized in the statement of operations under the caption impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  for the twelve months ended december  amortization expense related to the intangible assets was million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
estimated amortization expense related to intangible assets is  for the three months ended march  and million for the year ended december  the current balance of amortizable intangible assets will be fully amortized in stock based compensation stock based compensation consists of expenses for deferred compensation associated with the human code  tlg and adjacency acquisitions 
the decrease in stock based compensation for the twelve months ended december  relative to the comparable period in was primarily due to the reduction of deferred compensation for people that were no longer employed by the company 
in connection with the tlg acquisition  in july  we issued million of restricted common stock to the former tlg employees continuing with the company  of which approximately million has not been amortized as of december  in connection with the termination of certain tlg employees to whom the deferred compensation relates  approximately million of deferred compensation was reversed through additional paid in capital and approximately  was charged to restructuring and other related charges during the three months ended december  the total compensation charge was approximately million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation for the twelve months ended december  includes a non recurring catch up adjustment of approximately  to correct the amortization period 
we began to amortize the deferred compensation over a period of years  commencing on the date of acquisition 
the period should have been years  which was corrected during the three months ended september  the remaining deferred compensation will be charged to operations at the rate of approximately  per quarter for each of the next seven quarters  and  for the final quarter 
in connection with the acquisition of human code  we assumed the outstanding options granted under the human code stock option stock issuance plan 
the options vest ratably over periods up to four years 
we originally recorded deferred compensation of million related to the intrinsic value of the unvested options  of which  has not been amortized as of december  due to the termination of human code employees to whom the deferred compensation relates   and million of deferred compensation was reversed through additional paid in capital during the twelve months ended december  and  respectively

the shares vested ratably over three years starting on the date of employment  except for certain employees who were granted accelerated vesting upon a change in control of adjacency 
stock based compensation expense relating to these options was approximately  and  for the years ending december  and  respectively 
the deferred compensation has been fully amortized as of december  on october   we granted  shares of restricted common stock to senior officers of the company

gain on equity investment change in interest in may  our equity ownership percentage in di was diluted from approximately to approximately  as a result of a public offering of di s common stock 
our equity ownership percentage in di was previously diluted from approximately to approximately during the year ended december  in both periods  the dilution was due to the sale by di of shares to new investors  which occurred at a higher price per share than we previously paid  we recorded gains of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  our designee on di s board of directors resigned as a director of di and we sold a portion of our di investment

available for sale investments are reported at fair value as of each balance sheet date 
fair value is determined based on market quotations 
investments in equity securities for which fair value is not readily determinable are carried at cost 
if the fair value of the investment declines below cost  we consider available evidence  including the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost  to evaluate the extent to which the decline is other than temporary 
if the decline is considered other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment is adjusted down to fair value and the adjustment is included in our consolidated statement of operations 
if the decline is considered temporary in nature  the adjustment is reflected as a component of other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
in and  we recorded charges of approximately  and million  respectively  to write down certain investments we made in certain businesses because we considered the decline in the value of these investments to be other than temporary 
offsetting this charge  in  we realized gains on the sale of di shares of approximately  and recognized other income of approximately  based on the market value of di stock  we had approximately  of unrealized losses as of december  interest income interest income was derived primarily from investment of the proceeds from our public stock offerings  which were invested primarily in us government securities  tax exempt  short term municipal bonds and commercial paper 
the decrease in interest income for the year ended december  was due to the decrease in the average cash and investment balances and lower interest rates  offset in part by transferring investment balances to higher interest bearing taxable securities

the governmental clients continue to be slower payers  because of negotiated billing terms based on performance milestones  and the uk revenue has associated value added tax  which is included in the accounts receivable balance but not included in the revenue balance 
we expect dso for the three months ended march  to be in the range of days 
cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  this was due primarily to sales and maturities of short term investments net of purchases of million and proceeds from the sale of di shares of million  offset by capital expenditures of million primarily for expansion of our foreign office locations and the purchase of the minority interest in sapient kk of million 
cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was million for the year ended december   as a result of the repurchase of  shares of our common stock for approximately million under our previous stock repurchase program  offset by cash provided from the sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options of million 
our previous stock repurchase program was effective for one year  commencing on september  under this program  we repurchased million of our common stock in total  since its inception 
on october   we announced a new stock repurchase program of up to million over the next year 
this program became effective immediately 
purchases under our stock repurchase program may be made from time to time  in the open market  through block trades or otherwise 
we expect to purchase shares of our common stock under this program when market conditions  and our business and financial goals  permit 
to date  we have repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million under our new program  all of which was repurchased during the total cash outlay for the restructuring and other related activities implemented in and is expected to be approximately million 
the remaining million of restructuring and other related costs consists of non cash charges primarily for asset write offs and leasehold improvements for facilities being vacated 
as of december   million of cash had been used for restructuring and other related costs  of which million had been expended during lease termination payments were million 
table of contents and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the following summarizes our estimated future restructuring and other related activities cash outlay at december  in thousands thereafter we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure  restructuring  and stock repurchase program requirements for at least the next months 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
it supersedes the guidance in eitf issue no 
under eitf  an entity recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date that the entity committed itself to an exit plan 
under sfas  an entity s commitment to a plan does not  by itself  create a present obligation to other parties that meets the definition of a liability 
sfas also establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial measurement of the liability 
sfas will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force finalized eitf issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
eitf also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
however  it does not address when the criteria for revenue recognition are met or provide guidance on the appropriate revenue recognition convention for a given unit of accounting 
eitf is effective for all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   and early application is permitted 
upon adoption  entities may elect to either apply eitf prospectively or report the change in accounting as a cumulative effect adjustment 
the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a significant impact on the company 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit and warranty obligations 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  a company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions of fin relating to initial recognition and measurement must be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not expect the adoption of the initial recognition and measurement provisions in the first quarter of to have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the disclosure requirements of fin  which are effective for both interim and annual periods that end after december   were adopted by us for the year ended december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the transition 
table of contents and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we will continue to account for stock based compensation to employees under apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
we adopted the disclosure requirements of this statement as of december  in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is required to be applied to preexisting entities of the company as of the beginning of the first quarter after june  fin is required to be applied to all new entities with which the company becomes involved beginning february  based upon the accounting guidance and other information available  we do not believe our joint venture meets the definition of a variable interest entity 
we currently believe the adoption of fin will not have a significant impact on the company 
we believe the interpretive accounting guidance necessary for fin will continue to evolve 
additional interpretive guidance could affect the accounting for our joint venture 
risk factors the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual business and financial results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
the demand for business and technology consulting services has weakened significantly and demand will likely remain weak for some time because of the current economic climate the market for our consulting services and the technologies used in our solutions has changed rapidly over the last four years 
the market for advanced technology consulting services expanded dramatically during and most of  but declined significantly in and since the second half of  many companies have experienced financial difficulties or uncertainty  and canceled or delayed spending on technology initiatives as a result 
these companies typically are not demonstrating the same urgency regarding technology initiatives that existed during the economic expansion that stalled in this trend has worsened for some companies following the september  terrorist attacks in the united states and the accounting scandals involving enron  worldcom and other companies 
the economic uncertainty caused by the threat of military action in iraq will likely further depress technology spending 
if large companies continue to cancel or delay their business and technology consulting initiatives because of the current economic climate  or for other reasons  our business  financial condition and results of operations will continue to be materially and adversely affected 
our market is highly competitive and we may not be able to continue to compete effectively the markets for the services we provide are highly competitive 
we believe that we currently compete principally with large systems consulting and implementation firms and clients internal information systems departments 
we have begun to compete with offshore outsourcing companies  and we expect competition from these companies to increase in the future  especially on development  support and maintenance and outsourcing engagements 
we compete to a lesser extent with specialized e business consulting firms  strategy consulting firms and packaged technology vendors 
we compete frequently for client engagements against companies with far higher revenues and larger numbers of consultants than we have 
recent consolidations of large consulting companies within our market have further increased the size and resources of some of these competitors 
these competitors are often able to offer more scale  which in some instances has enabled them to significantly discount their services in exchange for revenues in other areas or at later dates 
additionally  in an effort to maintain market share  many of our competitors are heavily discounting their services to 
table of contents unprofitable levels 
some of our competitors have gone out of business 
if we cannot keep pace with the intense competition in our marketplace  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
our growing international operations and global distributed delivery model subject us to increased risk we currently have offices in the united kingdom  germany  india and canada and we have a joint venture in italy 
our international operations are growing as a percentage of our total revenues  and our global distributed delivery sm gdd model is a key component of our ability to successfully deliver our services 
international operations are subject to inherent risks  including economic recessions in foreign countries  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  political instability  war or military conflict  changes in regulatory requirements  costs and management of staffing multi national operations  significant changes in united states immigration policies or difficulties in obtaining required immigration approvals for international assignments  us imposed restrictions on the import and export of technologies  and reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries 
in particular  our gdd model depends heavily on our office in new delhi  india 
any escalation in the political or military instability in india  pakistan  iraq or the surrounding countries could hinder our ability to successfully utilize gdd  and could result in material adverse effects to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the delivery of our services from remote locations causes us to rely on data  phone  power and other networks which are not as reliable as those in other countries where we operate 
any failures of these systems could affect the success of our gdd model 
remote delivery of our services also increases the complexity and risk of delivering our services  which could affect our ability to satisfy our clients expectations or perform our services within the estimated time frame and budget for each project 
we have significant fixed operating costs  which may be difficult to adjust in response to unanticipated fluctuations in revenues a high percentage of our operating expenses  particularly personnel  rent and depreciation  are fixed in advance of any particular quarter 
as a result  an unanticipated decrease in the number or average size of  or an unanticipated delay in the scheduling for  our projects may cause significant variations in operating results in any particular quarter and could have a material adverse effect on operations for that quarter 
an unanticipated termination or decrease in size or scope of a major project  a client s decision not to proceed with a project we anticipated or the completion during a quarter of several major client projects could require us to maintain underutilized employees and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues and earnings may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter because of such factors as the contractual terms and timing of completion of projects  any delays incurred in connection with projects  the adequacy of provisions for losses and bad debts  the accuracy of our estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  loss of key highly skilled personnel necessary to complete projects  and general economic conditions 

table of contents we may lose money if we do not accurately estimate the costs of fixed price engagements most of our projects are based on fixed price  fixed time contracts  rather than contracts in which payment to us is determined on a time and materials basis 
our failure to accurately estimate the resources required for a project  or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project plan upon which our fixed price  fixed time contract was based  could adversely affect our overall profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has resulted in losses on those contracts 
we will likely experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the process  which could result in a fixed price that turns out to be too low and  therefore  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our clients could unexpectedly terminate their contracts for our services some of our contracts can be canceled by the client with limited advance notice and without significant penalty 
termination by any client of a contract for our services could result in a loss of expected revenues and additional expenses for staff which were allocated to that client s project 
we could be required to maintain underutilized employees who were assigned to the terminated contract 
the unexpected cancellation or significant reduction in the scope of any of our large projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be liable to our clients for damages caused by our services or by our failure to remedy system failures many of our projects involve technology applications or systems that are critical to the operations of our clients businesses and handle very large volumes of transactions 
if we fail to perform our services correctly  we may be unable to deliver applications or systems to our clients with the promised functionality or within the promised time frame  or to satisfy the required service levels for support and maintenance 
while we have taken precautionary actions to create redundancy and back up systems  any such failures by us could result in claims by our clients for substantial damages against us 
although we attempt to limit the amount and type of our contractual liability for defects in the applications or systems we provide  and carry insurance coverage which mitigates this liability in certain instances  we cannot be assured that these limitations and insurance coverages will be applicable and enforceable in all cases 
even if these limitations and insurance coverages are found to be applicable and enforceable  our liability to our clients for these types of claims could be material in amount and affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have begun to put a portion of our fees at risk based on project results and may lose these fees if we do not succeed our business model focuses heavily on delivering measurable business results for our clients  and increasingly we have begun to agree to align our interests with our client s interests by putting a portion of our fees at risk  dependent on our client s attainment of the business value we promised to our client 
no revenue has been recognized to date for performance standards 
our inability to deliver the business value that we have promised on a project could materially affect the profitability of that project  because we typically will incur the same level of project costs regardless of whether the promised business value is attained 
we could also experience delays in payment because the measurement of business value is often complex and may involve a verification process between us and our client 
as a result  our failure to deliver the business value that we promise to our clients could materially affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
businesses may decrease or delay their use of advanced technologies as a means for conducting commerce our future success depends heavily on the acceptance and use of advanced technologies as a means for conducting commerce and streamlining operations 
we focus our services on the development and implementation of advanced technology strategies and solutions 
if use of these advanced technologies does not grow  or 
table of contents grows more slowly than expected  our revenue could be less than we anticipate and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
consumers and businesses may delay adoption of advanced technologies for a number of reasons  including inability to implement and sustain profitable business models using advanced technologies  inadequate network infrastructure or bandwidth  delays in the development or adoption of new technical standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of usage  adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to new technologies and electronic commerce by federal  state or international governments that hinder the growth of new technologies  delays in the development of security and authentication technology necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential information  and failure of companies to meet their customers expectations in delivering goods and services using advanced technologies 
if we do not attract and retain qualified professional staff  we may not be able to adequately perform our client engagements and could be limited in accepting new client engagements our business is labor intensive  and our success depends upon our ability to attract  retain  train and motivate highly skilled employees 
although many specialized e business and other business and technology companies have reduced their work forces or slowed their hiring efforts  and although we reduced our work force at various times during and  intense competition still exists for certain employees who have specialized skills or significant experience in business and technology consulting 
we may not be successful in attracting a sufficient number of these highly skilled employees in the future 
furthermore  the industry turnover rates for these types of employees is high  and we may not be successful in retaining  training and motivating the employees we are able to attract 
our rate of voluntary turnover increased during portions of  although our voluntary turnover rate began to return closer to our targeted level of during the fourth quarter of any inability to attract  retain  train and motivate employees could impair our ability to adequately manage and complete existing projects and to bid for or accept new client engagements 
we must also devote substantial managerial and financial resources to monitoring and managing our workforce and other resources 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage the levels and related costs of our workforce and other resources effectively 
almost all of our employees participate in one or more of our stock option plans as a component of long term incentive compensation  and many of the stock options held by current employees have exercise prices that significantly exceed the recent trading range of our common stock 
a future prolonged decline or low stock price could result in reduced incentives for employees and in increased turnover 
our common stock may not remain in compliance with nasdaq national market listing requirements our common stock is listed on the nasdaq national market the nnm  which requires that listed stocks maintain a minimum per share closing bid price of between july and october  the closing bid price of our stock dropped below for certain periods of time 
the closing bid price of our stock has been above since october  if our closing bid price drops below per share in the future for consecutive trading days  nasdaq may notify us of the resulting deficiency 
if this happens  we must return to compliance within a specified grace period  or request a nasdaq hearing to present our compliance plan 
unless we develop a satisfactory plan for returning to compliance  nasdaq could eventually delist our stock from the nnm 
this would impact the liquidity of shares of our common stock 

table of contents our stock price is volatile and may result in substantial losses for investors the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
our trading price could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results and achievement of key business metrics by us or our competitors  changes in operating results estimates by securities analysts  any differences between our reported results and securities analysts published or unpublished expectations  announcements of new contracts or service offerings made by us or our competitors  announcements of acquisitions or joint ventures made by us or our competitors  and general economic or stock market conditions 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
the commencement of this type of litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary methodology our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary methodology and other intellectual property rights 
we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements  and copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  subcontractors  vendors  consultants and clients  and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
in addition  although we believe that our services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  infringement claims may be asserted against us in the future  and  if asserted  these claims may be successful 
a successful claim against us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our co chairmen and co ceos have significant voting power and may effectively control the outcome of any stockholder vote jerry a 
greenberg and j 
stuart moore  our co chairmen of the board of directors and co chief executive officers  own approximately of our common stock in the aggregate 
as a result  they have the ability to substantially influence  and may effectively control the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of sapient  even if such a change in control would benefit other investors 
we are dependent on our key employees our success will depend in large part upon the continued services of a number of key employees  including messrs 
greenberg and moore 
our employment arrangements with messrs 
greenberg and moore and with our other key personnel provide that employment is terminable at will by either party 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if our key employees resign from sapient to join a competitor or to form a competing company  the loss of such personnel and any resulting loss of existing or potential clients to any such competitor could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we require our employees to sign agreements prohibiting them from joining a competitor  forming a competing company or soliciting our clients or employees for certain periods of time  we cannot be certain that these agreements will be effective in preventing our key employees from engaging in 
table of contents these actions or that courts or other adjudicative entities will substantially enforce these agreements 
furthermore  for those employees whom we involuntarily terminated in connection with our restructurings in and  we have waived the non competition clause of their agreements in exchange for releases of claims 
we granted these waivers only in connection with the restructuring actions  and our general practice is not to waive the non competition obligations of other departing employees 
we may not be able to comply in a timely manner with all of the recently enacted or proposed corporate governance provisions beginning with the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of in july  a significant number of new corporate governance requirements have been adopted or proposed 
we believe that we currently comply with all of the requirements that have become effective thus far  and with many of the requirements that will become effective in the future 
although we currently expect to comply with all current and future requirements  we may not be successful in complying with these requirements at all times in the future 
in addition  certain of these requirements will require us to make changes to our corporate governance practices 
for example  one nasdaq proposal under review by the securities and exchange commission will require that a majority of our board of directors be composed of independent directors by our annual meeting of stockholders 
currently  only three of the six members of our board of directors are considered to be independent 
we may not be able to attract a sufficient number of directors in the future to satisfy this requirement  if enacted 
additionally  the commission recently passed a final rule that requires companies to disclose whether a member of their audit committee satisfies certain criteria as a financial expert 
although we currently have two audit committee members that satisfy this requirement and expect this to continue  we may not be able to satisfy this  or other  corporate governance requirements at all times in the future  and our failure to do so could cause the commission or nasdaq to take disciplinary actions against us  including an action to delist our stock from the nasdaq national market 
our corporate governance provisions may deter a financially attractive takeover attempt provisions of our charter and by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable  including a transaction in which stockholders would receive a premium for their shares 
these provisions include the following our board of directors is staggered into three classes and the members may be removed only for cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of at least two thirds of the shares entitled to vote  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the stockholders  to fix the rights and preferences of and issue shares of preferred stock  any action that may be taken by stockholders must be taken at an annual or special meeting and may not be taken by written consent  stockholders must comply with advance notice requirements before raising a matter at a meeting of stockholders or nominating a director for election  and a chairman of the board or a chief executive officer are the only persons who may call a special meeting of stockholders 
provisions of delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we have any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments 
at december   our exposure to market risk relates primarily to changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio 
our marketable investments consist primarily of fixed income securities 
we invest only with high credit quality issuers and we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not believe that a significant increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio
