overview sauer danfoss inc and subsidiaries the company is a leading international supplier of components and systems that generate  transmit and control fluid power in mobile equipment 
the company s products are used by original equipment manufacturers oems of mobile equipment  including construction  road building  agricultural  turf care and specialty equipment 
the company designs  manufactures and sells its products in the americas  europe and the asia pacific region  and sells its products throughout the rest of the world either directly or through distributors 
results of operations compared to consolidated results net income in was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income per diluted share of in special pretax charges of million in and million in had a negative impact on the results for the respective years 
the special charges for were million related to rationalizing overlapping product lines within the controls segment relating to the acquisition of the low voltage motor business te and a one time noncash after tax charge of million for goodwill impairment 
the special charges in related to plant closing costs of million and a bad debt write off of million relating to a customer in the aerial lift market filing for bankruptcy 
the following table  although not a us gaap disclosure  shows net income for the two years adjusted for these special charges in order to provide a more comparable picture of the company s net operating results in millions net income as reported product rationalization charge after tax goodwill impairment charge plant closing costs after tax bad debt write off after tax net income on comparable basis net income per share on comparable basis excluding the special charges in both years  net income in increased by over the primary driver for this improvement was the company s broad based cost control initiatives  particularly in the areas of fixed production costs  selling  general and administrative expenses  and research and development expenses 
in addition  the company focused significant attention on working capital management that resulted in a million reduction in trade receivables 
these factors helped generate a record operating cash flow of million  or an increase of over net sales in of million increased by million  or  over the sales of million 
excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuations  net sales increased ie net sales of businesses outside the united states measured in us dollars would have been lower had currency exchange translation rates remained at the same levels as the rates that prevailed during excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuations and acquisitions  net sales increased over gross profit in of million increased million or from gross profit of million 
the majority of the reported increase is a result of acquisitions completed in or those completed in and included for a full year in gross profit as a percentage of sales for was  compared to for while fixed production costs were reported to be million higher in compared to  the company successfully reduced overall fixed production costs by million compared to when the impact of currency exchange fluctuations and acquisitions are excluded 
had the company not achieved this cost reduction  gross profit as a percentage of sales would have declined slightly from pricing pressures within the markets the company serves continue to challenge the company to maintain profitability levels 
while the company was successful in reducing fixed costs in  it is not feasible to believe that the company can attain this same year over year reduction in this area 
therefore  the company has embarked on a global procurement initiative by establishing a global procurement office with resources in the us  europe  south america  and asia pacific 
the focus of this global procurement will be to leverage the company s global purchasing power to help reduce both direct and indirect material costs with a goal to obtain a margin improvement over the next months 
in addition  significant focus will be placed on the procurement of nonproductive materials  supplies and services in order to achieve additional cost reductions to offset the ongoing pricing pressures 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  over the reported amount of million 
excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuations  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  and excluding acquisitions  these expenses actually declined from the levels by million  reflecting the company s focus on reducing fixed costs during research and development activities in were essentially flat with the levels in terms of reported amounts 
excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuations and acquisitions  these expenses were million less than the levels 
while the company was focused on reducing fixed costs in all areas of the business  the company remains committed to investing in new technology and product development 
much of the company s product development activities continue to be driven by ongoing customer inquiries 
net nonoperating expenses increased by million over due primarily to foreign currency exchange losses and to the fact that the company no longer receives royalty income from its former japanese licensee as a result of forming a joint venture in the fourth quarter of this accounts for a million increase  which was offset by slightly lower net interest expense for the company s effective tax rate for of was lower than the effective tax rate of 
the primary driver for the lower effective rate in is related to the mix of the company s net income with a higher portion of the company s net income being generated in countries with lower effective tax rates 
business segment results the following discussion of operating results by reportable segment relates to information as presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
segment income is defined as the respective segment s portion of the total company s net income  excluding net interest  income taxes  minority interest  equity in net earnings of affiliates  and corporate expenses 
the format of this discussion for comparing the results from operations to is different from prior years due to the company changing its reportable segments beginning in to reflect the changes in organizational structure of the company around its various product lines of propel  work function and controls 
propel products include hydrostatic transmissions and related products that transmit the power from the engine to the wheel to propel a vehicle 
work function products include steering motors as well as gear pumps and motors that transmit power for the work functions of the vehicle 
controls products include electrohydraulic controls  microprocessors  and valves that control and direct the power of a vehicle 
because historical information for the year does not exist in this new segment format  the prior year s discussion and analysis of results from operations has been presented on the same basis as last year s report 
propel segment net sales for the propel segment of million increased million  or  from net sales of million 
all geographic regions in which the propel segment operates experienced net sales growth 
excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  net sales increased million 
additionally  excluding the impact of acquisitions  net sales increased million from approximately million of the increase in net sales was driven by a new product introduction for compact utility tractors in the us and from the infinitely variable transmission for agriculture tractors developed for john deere 
in the turf care market  million of increased sales were generated by the company s joint venture located in sullivan  illinois 
however  these increases in the us were partially offset by declines in the agriculture  construction  specialty and distribution markets 
in europe  both the agriculture and road building markets experienced growth over the agriculture market in europe recovered somewhat in after several difficult years caused by the foot and mouth disease scare 
these increases in europe were offset be declines in the construction  turf care  and specialty markets 
propel segment income in of million increased million  or  over segment income of million in excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuations and acquisitions  propel segment income increased million  with all of this increase being driven by the turf care market 
work function segment net sales in the work function segment of million in increased by million  or  over net sales of million 
excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuations and acquisitions  net sales increased million  or  from while sales of steering units and low speed high torque motors increased million over  this was partially offset by a decline of gear pump and motor sales of million 
work function segment income in of million increased million  or  over segment income of million 
excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuations  work function segment income increased million from the work function segment was impacted by a one time special charge of million in related to goodwill impairment 
the segment income was negatively impacted by a one time pretax charge of million related to plant closing costs 
excluding these special charges and the impact of currencies  segment income for the work function segment increased million  or  over  driven by the overall higher sales levels within this segment 
controls segment net sales in the controls segment in of million increased million  or  over segment net sales of million 
during  the company completed the acquisition of te 
the addition of this business added million of sales to this segment 
excluding this acquisition and the impact of currency exchange fluctuations  net sales for would have declined by million from the comparable levels 
the majority of this decrease comes from the aerial lift market in the us that continues to be depressed 
controls segment income for of million decreased million  or  from segment income of million 
the te business added million to the controls segment income 
excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency exchange fluctuations  the controls segment income declined million from however  in  the controls segment was negatively impacted by a special pretax charge of million relating to product line rationalization as a result of overlapping product lines within this segment relating to the acquisition of the te business 
on a comparable basis to  controls segment income declined million  or  from corporate function the company s corporate function incurs costs that relate to worldwide services such as worldwide tax and accounting fees paid to outside third parties  certain insurance premiums  the amortization of intangible assets from certain business combinations  and internal global services departments  along with the operating costs of the company s executive office which was established in located in lincolnshire  illinois 
for  total corporate charges amounted to million  or an increase of million from the charges of million 
order backlog total order backlog at the end of was million  compared to million at the end of  an increase of 
on a comparable basis  excluding the effects of acquisitions  order backlog increased from the year end levels  or excluding the additional impact of currency fluctuations 
during the fourth quarter of  million in new orders were written  an increase of compared to the fourth quarter of excluding the impact of acquisitions  orders written in the fourth quarter were million  which was more than the orders written in the fourth quarter of  but a decrease of excluding the additional impact of currency fluctuation 
compared to net sales sales for of million increased by million  or  from the prior year 
however  all of this increase was due to the impact of acquisitions  both from having a full year effect of acquisitions made in  and the effect of acquisitions made during on a comparable basis  including a full year of sales from danfoss fluid power dfp and excluding the effects of acquisitions made during  net sales decreased in local currencies  and were down as reported in us dollars 
further comparisons of the company s markets are very difficult due to acquisitions  however  by including dfp for the full year of  the company experienced decreases in most of its markets as follows construction declined  road building was down  turf care declined and the distributor area was down 
the only bright spots were in agriculture  which increased a modest compared to significantly lower levels in the prior couple of years  and in the specialty market which was essentially flat with the prior year 
the following table sets forth the company s net sales by market  including dfp for the full year  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of total net sales  for the years ended december  and december  dollars of total dollars of total agriculture specialty turf care construction road building distribution and aftermarket gross profit gross profit for of million  or of sales  was down from the reported million of gross profit in  which was of sales 
the lower gross profit experienced in was due in large part to lower plant utilization experienced from the dramatic decline in sales in north america with a slightly lower impact in europe 
coupled with this effect was a pretax charge of million of unexpected additional costs associated with the final closure of the racine  wisconsin  plant and associated move to the company s west branch  iowa  plant 
in addition  the company took a bad debt write off of million before taxes relating to a customer in the aerial lift market filing for bankruptcy during the second quarter 
during the company took several actions to reduce manufacturing expenses including reductions in factory headcount commensurate with the volume reduction  several weeklong plant shutdowns  and other cost reduction activities 
however  these measures were not enough to completely offset the effects of the above mentioned items 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for of million increased by million  or  from the same period of the inclusion of four additional months in of dfp results accounts for million of this increase 
an additional million of expense was incurred due to a full year s amortization of goodwill from dfp  and additional amortization from other intangibles established from the final appraisals related to the dfp and other acquisitions 
the company anticipates that ongoing amortization will be reduced by approximately million per year for and beyond due to the cessation of goodwill amortization under statement of financial accounting standards no 
see other matters below for further discussion on this new accounting pronouncement 
the majority of the remaining million increase is due to acquisitions made in research and development expenses research and development expenses of million increased by million  or  from and represent of total net sales for compared to of net sales in the additional four months of dfp in accounts for million of the increase 
the remaining increase reflects the effects of acquisitions made during and the company s ongoing development of new customer programs  such as the recent introduction of the infinitely variable transmission for the agriculture tractor market 
nonoperating expenses  net net nonoperating expenses for of million were million higher than net expenses of million 
net interest expense for of million increased by million from the net expense of million 
despite overall declines in the company s floating borrowing rates during see discussion of the company s borrowing rates in note of the consolidated financial statements  the higher overall bank borrowings used to fund acquisitions during the year drove the net interest expense significantly higher along with the additional four months of borrowings in for the dfp acquisition in may other income  net for of million decreased by million from s other income of million related primarily to currency exchange gains 
in addition  the company realized million less royalty income from its japanese licensee  daikin industries  ltd  due to the formation of a joint venture with daikin as of october  the license agreement was terminated as of that date  and the company will no longer receive royalties from daikin 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for of million decreased million from the provision for income taxes of million 
the decrease is a direct result of the decrease in income before income taxes of million coupled with a slight decrease in the effective tax rate for of compared to an effective tax rate for of 
net income the company ended with net income of million  down million from the million of net income in the economic downturn experienced by most of the company s markets  coupled with the nonrecurring plant shutdown costs  bad debt write off discussed above  and higher interest expense contributed to this decline 
order backlog total order backlog at the end of was million  compared to million at the end of  a decrease of 
on a comparable basis  excluding the effects of acquisitions  order backlog declined from the year end levels  or excluding the impact of currency fluctuations 
during the fourth quarter of  million in new orders were written  a decrease of compared to the fourth quarter of excluding the impact of acquisitions  orders written in the fourth quarter were million  which was less than the orders written in the fourth quarter of  or a decrease of excluding the impact of currency fluctuation 
market risk the company is naturally exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and prices impact of foreign currency the company has historically not entered into any type of foreign currency hedging or derivative arrangements to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the foreign currency markets 
however  during  the company did enter into a foreign currency hedge contract to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations for a loan to the u 
s 
holding company from a danish bank denominated in euros 
in addition  the company assumed a foreign currency exchange contract through its acquisition of the thrige electric business in denmark 
in all other instances  the company feels it is well balanced between its us and european operations because the company generates its sales in the same country in which it incurs its expenses 
however  the company is impacted by foreign currency fluctuations in terms of comparing results from period to period as discussed below 
the company has operations and sells its products in many different countries of the world and therefore conducts its business in various currencies 
the company s financial statements  which are presented in us dollars  can be impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk 
translation risk is the risk that the financial statements of the company  for a particular period or as of a certain date  may be affected by changes in the exchange rates that are used to translate the financial statements of the company s operations from foreign currencies into dollars 
transaction risk is the risk from the company receiving its sale proceeds or holding its assets in a currency different from that in which it pays its expenses and holds its liabilities 
with respect to transaction risk  the impact on the company s operating results has not been significant 
with respect to translation risk  fluctuations of currencies against the us dollar can be substantial and therefore significantly impact comparisons with prior periods 
the impact is primarily a reporting consideration and does not affect the underlying results of operations 
the translation impact on making prior period comparisons with respect to the company s net sales can be material 
however  as shown in the table below  historically the translation impact on net sales has not been significant in recent years 
percentage sales growth decline over prior year as reported without currency translation impact includes the effect of dfp for the full year of and excludes the effects of acquisitions made in excludes the effects of the dfp sales since may   for comparison purposes 
during  the us dollar weakened substantially against most foreign currencies  especially the euro 
between december  and december   the us dollar weakened by against the euro 
this has resulted in approximately one third of the company s total balance sheet being stated higher than the prior year since roughly one third of the company s total assets and liabilities are denominated in the euro 
while this translation difference does not affect the underlying results of operations  it does affect comparisons between periods 
interest rates the company does not currently enter into any type of interest rate hedging or derivative arrangements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes 
the following table summarizes the maturity of the company s debt obligations for fixed and variable rate debt fixed rate debt variable rate debt thereafter   total   liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity have been from internally generated funds from operations and from borrowings under its credit facilities in   and net cash provided by operating activities for of million increased by million from million for the operating cash flow level is the highest in the company s history  led by reductions in trade receivables of million reflecting the company s emphasis on collecting from its customers  particularly in the us the reduction in receivables coupled with increases in accrued liabilities generated a combined million of increased cash flow offset by reductions in trade payables and other working capital accounts of million 
the high level of operating cash flow allowed the company to fund all of its capital expenditures of million  which was down million from the capital expenditure levels of million 
in addition  the company was able to complete two cash acquisitions for million utilizing cash flow from operations 
heading into  the company expects that its capital expenditures will increase slightly from the record low levels in however  the company intends to control the level of capital expenditures as it monitors the economy and markets that it serves 
the company believes it has existing production capacity  flexibility and efficiency to handle any market upturn in the near future 
for  the percentage of capital expenditures by region were approximately in north america  in europe and the remaining amount in asia  compared to the year split of in north america  in europe and a small amount in asia 
in addition to funding all of the company s investing activities  the cash provided by operating activities also funded dividends of million and distributions to minority interest partners of million 
net borrowings under short and long term credit facilities decreased in by million compared to an increase in of million 
the decrease in net borrowings in reflects repayments from excess cash flow generated 
net borrowings for reflected the financing of acquisitions during the year 
the company operates under certain covenants as defined under its various credit agreements with its banks 
during  the company renegotiated its us revolving credit facility 
this negotiation resulted in changes to covenants related to earnings performance and cash flow 
although the company is currently meeting these new covenants  certain factors such as the uncertain economy in the us coupled with the company s financial performance could put the company at risk of continuing to meet these covenants 
should the company not meet these covenants  the result would be a default on the us revolving credit facility 
as of december   the entire outstanding balance of the us revolving credit facility is classified as current since the agreement ends in october the company is currently working on a new worldwide credit arrangement with a number of banks and expects to have this arrangement completed by the end of the second quarter of the following table discloses the company s future commitments under contractual obligations as of december  contractual cash obligations total thereafter long term debt      operating leases      other      total contractual cash obligations    other matters the company s critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management must make a variety of decisions which impact the reported amounts and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied  the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates  and the consistent application of those accounting principles 
due to the type of industry in which the company operates and the nature of its business  the following accounting policies are those that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a more comprehensive list of the company s accounting policies is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation being a manufacturer  inventory is a substantial portion of the total assets of the company 
therefore  the company must periodically evaluate the carrying value of its inventory to assess the proper valuation 
this includes having adequate allowances and period adjustments to cover losses in the normal course of operation  provide for excess and obsolete inventory  and ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
for all of these  the company applies consistent practices based upon historical data such as actual loss experience  past and projected usage  and actual margins generated from trade sales of its products 
warranty provisions the company warrants its various products over differing periods depending upon the type of product and application 
consequently  the company  from time to time in the normal course of business  incurs costs to repair or replace defective products 
in these instances  the company will record a specific provision for the costs it will incur to repair or replace these products utilizing information from customers and internal information regarding the specific cost of materials and labor 
in addition  the company records a provision for future warranty claims against its applicable product sales based on past trends of actual warranty claims compared to the actual sales levels to which those claims apply 
this analysis is prepared quarterly 
useful lives of property  plant and equipment the company has a significant amount invested in manufacturing plants and machine tools 
this requires the company to periodically assess the estimated useful lives of its assets in order to match  through depreciation  the cost of those assets with the benefits derived over the period of usefulness 
the useful lives of these assets can be shortened through greater use due to volume increases  rapidly changing technology such as the use of electronics and computer operated controls  and through inadequate maintenance 
despite management s best efforts to determine the appropriate useful lives of its equipment  certain situations arise that lead to an asset or group of assets becoming impaired  meaning their economic value becomes less than the value at which the company is carrying the asset on its books 
examples of these situations are product rationalization efforts or restructuring of manufacturing facilities 
when these situations arise  the company tests the assets for impairment and will write down the asset in the period when the impairment becomes known 
valuation of trade receivables the company records trade receivables due from its customers at the time a sale is recorded in accordance with its revenue recognition policy 
the future collectability of these amounts can be impacted by the company s collection efforts  the financial stability of its customers  and the general economic climate in which it operates 
the company applies a consistent practice of establishing an allowance for accounts that it feels may become uncollectible through reviewing the historical aging of its receivables and by monitoring the financial strength of its customers 
where the company becomes aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations ie  where it has filed for bankruptcy  the company establishes a specific allowance for the potential bad debt to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
the valuation of trade receivables is performed quarterly 
workers compensation the company has an insurance policy to cover workers compensation claims in which the company pays the first million per claim  per incident 
the company establishes its workers compensation reserve based on historic growth factors of claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported claims 
this analysis is performed on a quarterly basis  or more frequently if factors dictate a more frequent review 
pensions the company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for most of its employees 
the company s funding policy for the us plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income security act of  plus any additional amounts the company may deem to be appropriate 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a minimum liability is required to be established on the consolidated balance sheets representing the amount of unfunded accrued pension cost 
this represents the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
when it is necessary to establish an additional minimum pension liability  an amount is recorded as an intangible pension asset limited to unrecognized prior service cost 
any amount in excess of unrecognized prior service cost is recorded as a reduction to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the company has recorded an intangible pension asset of million and an accumulated reduction to stockholders equity of million 
to account for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 the company must make three main determinations at the end of each year first  it must determine the actuarial assumption for the discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the projected benefit obligations for the end of the current year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining this rate  the company looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments and periodic published rate ranges 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a listing of the discount rates used in the various countries where the company has these pension plans 
second  the company must determine the actuarial assumption for rates of increase in compensation levels used in the calculation of the accumulated and projected benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a table showing the rates used for the various countries where the company has these pension plans 
third  the company must determine the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption that is used to determine the expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return is deferred under sfas no 
and is recognized to net periodic pension cost over a four year period 
see the table in note to the consolidated financial statements for the expected long term rates used for postretirement benefits other than pensions the company provides a single postretirement health care benefit for certain employee groups in the united states 
this plan is contributory and contains certain other cost sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance 
the company does not pre fund this plan and has the right to modify or terminate this plan in the future 
the company accounts for its postretirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  which requires the postretirement liability recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and the postretirement cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income be determined on an actuarial basis 
to account for its postretirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 the company must make two determinations 
first  it must determine the actuarial assumption for the discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to determine the postretirement cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining this rate  the company looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments and periodic published rate ranges 
second  the company must determine the actuarial assumption for the health care trend rate used in the calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to determine the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the subsequent year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the assumptions used as of december  new accounting policies in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also provides new criteria in the determination of intangible assets  including goodwill acquired in a business combination  and expands the financial disclosures concerning business combinations consummated after june  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting level using a two step impairment test 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 the company reclassified approximately million of established workforce from other intangibles into goodwill and performed an evaluation of goodwill as of january  the results of this evaluation indicated that goodwill related to the open circuit reporting unit within the work function segment was impaired 
the performance of this reporting unit has not met management s original expectations  primarily due to economic factors and the competitive nature of this commodity type product 
the company measured the amount of impairment based on a comparison of the fair value to its carrying value 
fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology by applying an appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and cost methodology 
the company retained the services of a third party appraisal firm in determining the fair value of the open circuit reporting unit 
accordingly  the company recognized a million noncash after tax charge as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the write off of goodwill related to the open circuit reporting unit 
the company expects the performance of the open circuit business will improve over the next few years as a result of product rationalization and the moving of manufacturing into lower cost countries 
the company remains committed to this business 
in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize liabilities and costs associated with exit or disposal activities initiated after december   when they are incurred  rather than when management commits to a plan to exit an activity 
while the company is undergoing a number of activities to restructure its sales and distribution activities in europe and to rationalize certain production facilities and products in the future  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on the company s financial position or net income 
business combinations and business ventures during the first quarter  the company completed the purchase of a minority interest in comatrol spa comatrol  located in reggio emilia  italy  has employees and approximately million in annual sales
