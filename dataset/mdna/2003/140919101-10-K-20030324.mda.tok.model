item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of the results of the operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
historical results and percentage relationships among accounts are not necessarily an indication of trends in operating results for any future period 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management of the company evaluates estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different future conditions 
management believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  in that they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to the company 
these critical accounting policies relate to impairment of intangible assets and long lived assets  reserves related to title insurance and escrow losses  determination of fair values of fixed maturity bonds and equity securities  and contingencies and litigation 
management performs a test of each reporting unit for which goodwill is attributed to evaluate for any impairment of intangible assets at least annually 
this includes  among other things  a review of events or circumstances which would indicate an impairment of goodwill 
future losses from reporting units that goodwill is attributed to may lead to an impairment charge in future periods 
when evaluating title insurance and escrow losses management estimates reserves for known claims as well as a provision for incurred but not reported losses based on several factors including  but not limited to  historical loss experience  and current industry and legal environments 
management determines the fair value of fixed maturity bonds and equity securities by obtaining quoted market prices 
contingencies and litigation are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and  in conjunction with legal counsel  determinations are made as to the outcome of any lawsuits and advice of claims 
based on this assessment  any required reserves are reflected in the company s financial statements 
management believes estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances  however  should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences  there could be a material impact on the company s future financial condition or results of operations

forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
among others  these forward looking statements are based on assumptions that a volume of real estate transactions in the company s market areas will remain at sufficient levels to support the company s business  b the company will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses and the results of operations therefrom will support the acquisition price  c the company will be able to retain  and when needed  add key personnel  d the company s forecasts will accurately anticipate market demand  e there will be no material adverse changes in the company s existing operations and f the company will be able to obtain sufficient equity or debt funding to increase its capital resources by the amount needed for new business acquisitions  if any 
assumptions related to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic  competitive and market conditions  and future business decisions  all of which are beyond the control of the company 
although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements are reasonable  any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and  therefore  there can be no assurance that the results contemplated in forward looking statements will be realized 
in addition  the business and operations of the company are subject to substantial risks  which increase the uncertainty inherent in such forward looking statements 
in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward looking information included herein  the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the company  or any other person  that the company s plans or objectives will be achieved 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s business is cyclical due to the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the level of real estate activity 
periods of high interest rates adversely effect real estate activity and therefore title and escrow revenues 
in addition  the amount of interest income derived from available cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
the company s investment portfolio and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
an increase or decrease in prevailing interest rates typically translate into a decrease or increase in fair values of interest sensitive financial instruments 
at december   the carrying amounts reported in the company s consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  fixed maturity bonds and equity securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt approximate fair value 
fair values of fixed maturity bonds may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the security and other general market conditions 
the company s investments in equity securities are based on quoted market prices by third party sources 
market prices are subject to variability and as a result  the amount the company may realize from a sale of an equity security investment may ultimately be significantly different than the reported market values 
variability in market prices may occur as a result of changes in economic conditions  relative price of similar  alternative investment choices and the market s perceived change in the value of the security itself 
the company s long term debt is comprised of two term loans  one of which provides for a variable interest rate 
had interest rates increased decreased basis points  interest expense on outstanding debt would have increased decreased approximately  for the year ended december
