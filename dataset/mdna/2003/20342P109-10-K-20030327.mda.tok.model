the average term of a time deposit at december  was ten months  and therefore  on average  it takes ten months for the portfolio to react to changes in interest rates 
the interest rate changes in occurred throughout the entire year  and therefore most of the repricing in the time deposit portfolio did not occur until in addition  beginning in  wholesale cds were utilized to fund the sba guaranteed portions of loans retained  as well as loans held for sale

the terms of the swap are identical to the trust  except for the fact that the company receives from the counterparty a fixed rate of interest at on a million notional amount  and pays a variable rate of interest to the counterparty at a rate of month libor plus 
the two amounts are netted together on the payment dates with the net difference being paid either to the company or the counterparty  as appropriate 
the swap is being treated as a hedge for accounting purposes 
while there was minimal impact to the interest expense in  the company expects  based on the current libor rate of as of february   to receive a significant credit against interest expense in  assuming interest rates remain at current levels throughout the entire year

nonaccrual loans are impaired loans where the original contractual amount may not be fully collectible 
the company measures its impaired loans by using the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent and the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate if the loan is not collateral dependent 
as of december   and  all impaired or nonaccrual loans were collateral dependent 
the company places loans on nonaccrual status that are delinquent days or more or when a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of interest and principal 
the company had fourteen loans on nonaccrual status as of december   totaling  of this total  or  was guaranteed by the government 
as of december   the company had twelve loans on nonaccrual status  totaling  of this total   or  was guaranteed by the government

interest income that would have been recorded on loans on nonaccrual status  under the original terms of such loans  would have totaled  for the year ended december    for and  for in addition to the loans disclosed above as nonaccrual or restructured  management has also identified approximately million in loans that  on the basis 
table of contents of information known to us  were judged to have a higher than normal risk of becoming non performing 
management cannot  however  predict the extent to which economic conditions may worsen or other factors may impact our borrowers and our loan portfolio 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that other loans will not become days or more past due  be placed on nonaccrual  become restructured loans  or become other real estate owned or repossessed assets in the future 
certain financial institutions have elected to use special purpose vehicles spv to dispose of problem assets 
a spv is typically a subsidiary company with an asset and liability structure and legal status that makes its obligations secure even if the parent company goes bankrupt 
under certain circumstances  these financial institutions may exclude the problem assets from their reported impaired and non performing assets 
we do not use those vehicles  or any other accounting structures  to dispose of problem assets 
classified assets 
from time to time  management has reason to believe that certain borrowers may not be able to repay their loans within the parameters of the present repayment terms  even though  in some cases  the loans are current at the time 
these loans are graded in the classified loan grades of substandard  doubtful  or loss and include non performing loans 
each classified loan is monitored monthly 
classified assets consisting of nonaccrual loans  loans graded as substandard or lower and reo at december  and were million and million  respectively 
risk management 
the investment of the company s funds is primarily in loans where a greater degree of risk is normally assumed than in other forms of investments 
sound underwriting of loans and continuing evaluations of the underlying collateral and performance of the borrowers are an integral part in the maintenance of a high level of quality in the total assets of the company 
net loan charge offs for the year ended december  were  or of average gross loans outstanding  compared to  or of average gross loans outstanding  for the year ended december  allowance for loan losses 
the company has established a methodology for the determination of provisions for loan losses 
the methodology is set forth in a formal policy and takes into consideration the need for an overall allowance for loan losses as well as specific allowances that are tied to individual loans 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include the formula allowance and a specific allowance for identified problem loans 
in originating loans  the company recognizes that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the collateral securing the loan 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged against earnings and reduced by net loan chargeoffs 
loans are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectible  or partially charged off when portions of a loan are deemed to be uncollectible 
recoveries are generally recorded only when cash payments are received 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the responsibility for the review of the company s assets and the determination of the adequacy of the general valuation allowance lies with the director s loan committee 
this committee assigns the loss reserve ratio for each type of asset and reviews the adequacy of the allowance at least quarterly based on an evaluation of the portfolio  past experience  prevailing market conditions  amount of government guarantees  concentration in loan types and other relevant factors 
specific valuation allowances are established to absorb losses on loans for which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured as prescribed in sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 

the amount of the specific allowance is based on the estimated value of the collateral securing the loans and other analyses pertinent to each situation 
loans are identified for specific allowances from information provided by several sources  including asset classification  third party reviews  delinquency reports  periodic updates to financial statements  public records and industry reports 
all loan types are subject to specific allowances once identified 
table of contents as an impaired or non performing loan 
loans not subject to specific allowances are placed into pools by one of the following collateral types commercial real estate  one to four family real estate  aircraft  consumer home equity  consumer other  construction and other commercial loans 
all non specific reserves are allocated to one of these categories 
estimates of identifiable losses are reviewed continually and  generally  a provision for losses is charged against operations on a monthly basis as necessary to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level 
management presents an analysis of the allowance for loan losses to the company s board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the directors loan committee meets quarterly to review and monitor conditions in the portfolio and to determine the appropriate allowance for loan losses 
to the extent that any of these conditions are evidenced by identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  the committee s estimate of such condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment 
by assessing the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis  the bank is able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates based upon the most recent information that has become available 
the following table sets forth information regarding the bank s allowance for loan losses at the dates and for the periods indicated at or for the years ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period chargeoffs real estate loans one to four family commercial consumer total chargeoffs recoveries real estate loans one to four family commercial consumer total recoveries net chargeoffs reserve for losses on commitments to extend credit provision for loan losses balance at end of period net charge offs to average loans reserve for losses on commitments to extend credit as of december  the balance in the allowance for loan losses was million compared to million as of december  in addition  the reserve for losses on commitments to extend credit was decreased to  as of december   compared to  as of december  the balance of commitments to extend credit on undisbursed construction and other loans was million as of december   compared to million as of december  the reduction of the reserve for losses on commitments to extend credit was due to an internal evaluation of the credit risk of the underlying collateral  combined with a review of the historical losses incurred on the underlying collateral 
risks and uncertainties exist in all lending transactions  and even though there have historically been no charge offs on construction and other loans that have not been fully disbursed  the director s loan committee has established reserve levels for 
table of contents each category based upon loan type as well as market conditions for the underlying real estate and other collateral  considering such factors as trends in the real estate market  economic uncertainties and other risks  where it is probable that losses could be incurred in future periods 
in general there are no reserves established for the government guaranteed portion of commitments to extend credit 
as of december  the allowance was of total gross loans compared to as of december  including the reserve for losses on commitments to extend credit  the allowance was of total gross loans as of december   compared to as of december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was as of december   compared to as of december  the allowance for loan losses  including reserves for losses on commitments to extend credit  to non performing loans  net of government guarantees was as of december   compared to as of december  the company performs a migration analysis on a quarterly basis using an eight quarter history of charge offs to average loans by collateral type 
during and  net charge offs as a percent of average loans outstanding were only and  respectively 
the low levels of net charge offs in and can be attributed to the strong economy in the company s primary market area  including the significant rise in real estate values across all collateral types 
in  net charge offs as a percent of average loans outstanding increased to  therefore the eight quarter average increased accordingly  which  when combined with the growth in total loans outstanding  resulted in an increase in the level of reserves required from million as of december  to million as of december  in  the net charge offs to average loans outstanding was  and when combined with the average for of  increased the eight quarter average over the eight quarter average as of december   which  combined with the growth in total loans outstanding  resulted in an increase in the level of reserves outstanding from million as of december  to million as of december  the director s loan committee has also established reserve levels for each category based upon loan type  as certain loan types may not have incurred losses or have had minimal losses in the eight quarter migration analysis  but it is probable that losses could be incurred in future periods 
the directors loan committee will consider trends in delinquencies and potential charge offs by loan type  market for underlying real estate or other collateral  trends in industry types  economic changes and other risks 
in general  there are no reserves established for the government guaranteed portion of loans outstanding 
during the year ended december  management charged off  net of recoveries and provided million to the provision for loan losses 
during the year ended december  management charged off  net of recoveries to the allowance while it provided million to the provision for loan losses 
for the year ended december   net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was  compared to for the year ended december  management believes the allowance at december  is adequate based upon its ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio  historical loss trends and other factors 
although management believes that they use the best information available to make such determinations  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
nonaccrual loans  net of the government guaranteed portion  decreased to  or of total gross loans as of december  compared to million or of total gross loans as of december  as of december  and  the company had no other real estate owned properties

other changes are the result of relative changes in the size of the loan portfolios 
as a result of past decreases in local and regional real estate values and the significant losses experienced by many financial institutions  there has been a greater level of scrutiny by regulatory authorities of the loan portfolios of financial institutions undertaken as a part of the examinations of such institutions by banking regulators 
while the company believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will not request the company to increase significantly its allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans 
table of contents deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
other assets premises and equipment  other repossessed assets  accrued interest and other assets  income tax receivable  deferred tax asset  servicing asset  net and interest only strips  are the seven major components of other assets 
premises and equipment increased to million  or as of december  compared to million as of december  the increase is due to opening of the new corporate headquarters on march other repossessed assets totaled million as of december  due to the repossession of an aircraft 
the aircraft was subsequently sold during and there were no other repossessed assets as of december  accrued interest and other assets decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  the major component of accrued interest and other assets is interest accrued and not yet received on loans 
the decrease in comparison with the increase in the interest earning assets is due to the decrease in yield on interest earning assets from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  income tax receivable totaled  as of december  there were no income taxes receivable as of december  the deferred tax asset increased to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the increase in the deferred tax asset is primarily related to additional allowances for loan losses and certain accrued expenses 
servicing asset  net  increased to million as of december   compared to million as of december  the increase reflects the additions due to loan sales during the year ended december   net of the amortization of the servicing asset  combined with a  recovery of an impairment write down of  in the valuation of the servicing asset reflects estimates as to the expected life of the underlying loans which may be adversely affected by higher than expected levels of pay offs in periods of lower rates or charge offs in periods of economic difficulty 
in addition  when property values increase due to general economic conditions  borrowers have refinancing opportunities available to them  which may result in higher prepayment rates 
management periodically evaluates the servicing assets for impairment 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the rights are stratified based on original term to maturity 
the amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the servicing assets for a stratum exceeds their fair value 
the weighted average prepayment speed was as of december  compared to as of december  see the footnotes to the financial statements  found elsewhere in this report  for further information on servicing assets 
rights to future interest income from serviced loans that exceeds contractually specified servicing fees are classified as interest only strips 
interest only strips increased to  as of december   compared to  as of december  the increase is due to the increase in loans serviced for others as a result of the loan sales in  combined with the effect of the change in market value caused by the reduction in average prepayment speeds 
the weighted average prepayment speed was as of december  compared to as of december deposits and borrowings total deposits increased to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the increase is due to a increase in retail deposits as a result of the expansion of the 
table of contents retail banking operation in  including the addition of two new branches

other borrowings totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december  the company established a line of credit with the fhlb collateralized by loans and securities 
funds from the credit line were used to increase liquidity at the company 
in addition to the fhlb advances  other lines of credit are utilized to increase capital at the bank and to fund the company s esop 
the esop was terminated in and the borrowings of  were repaid at that time

interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk irr and credit risk constitute the two greatest sources of financial exposure for insured financial institutions 
please refer to item business lending and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition loans  for a thorough discussion of the company s lending activities 
irr represents the impact that changes in absolute and relative levels of market interest rates may have upon the company s net interest income nii 
changes in the nii are the result of changes in the net interest spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities timing risk  the relationship between various rates basis risk  and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
the company realizes income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  investments  other interest earning assets and the interest incurred on deposits 
the volumes and yields on loans  deposits and borrowings are affected by market interest rates 
as of december   of the company s loan portfolio was tied to adjustable rate indices 
the majority of the loans are tied to prime and reprice immediately 
the exception is sba a loans  which reprice on the first day of the subsequent quarter after a change in prime 
as of december   of the company s deposits were time deposits with a stated maturity generally one year or less and a fixed rate of interest 
as of december   of the company s borrowings were fixed rate with a remaining term of years 
the company entered into an interest rate swap in december which effectively changes this fixed rate liability to a variable rate liability with a six month adjustment period 
the following gap table reflects the affects of this interest rate swap 
changes in the market level of interest rates directly and immediately affect the company s interest spread  and therefore profitability 
sharp and significant changes to market rates can cause the interest spread to shrink or expand significantly in the near term  principally because of the timing differences between the adjustable rate loans and the maturities and therefore repricing of the deposits and borrowings 

table of contents the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for managing the company s assets and liabilities in a manner that balances profitability  irr and various other risks including liquidity 
alco operates under policies and within risk limits prescribed by  reviewed and approved by the board of directors 
alco seeks to stabilize the company s nii by matching rate sensitive assets and liabilities through maintaining the maturity and repricing of these assets and liabilities at appropriate levels given the interest rate environment 
when the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds rate sensitive assets within specified time periods  nii generally will be negatively impacted by increasing rates and positively impacted by decreasing rates 
conversely  when the amount of rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of rate sensitive liabilities within specified time periods  net interest income will generally be positively impacted by increasing rates and negatively impacted by decreasing rates 
the speed and velocity of the repricing assets and liabilities will also contribute to the effects on the company s nii  as will the presence or absence of periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors 
the company utilizes two methods for measuring interest rate risk  gap analysis and interest income simulations 
gap analysis focuses on measuring absolute dollar amounts subject to repricing within certain periods of time  particularly the one year maturity horizon 
interest income simulations are produced using a software model that is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the company s financial instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on current volumes of applicable financial instruments 
interest rate simulations provide the company with an estimate of both the dollar amount and percentage change in nii under various rate scenarios 
all assets and liabilities are normally subjected to up to basis points in increases and decreases in interest rates in basis point increments 
however  under the current interest rate environment  decreases in interest rates have been simulated at  and basis points 
under each interest rate scenario  the company projects its net interest income 
from these results  the company can then develop alternatives in dealing with the tolerance thresholds 
a traditional  although analytically limited measure  of a financial institutions irr is the static gap 
static gap is the difference between the amount of assets and liabilities adjusted for any off balance sheet positions which are expected to mature or reprice within a specific period 
generally  a positive gap benefits an institution during periods of rising interest rates  and a negative gap benefits an institution during periods of declining interest rates 
at december   of the company s interest bearing deposits were comprised of certificate accounts  the majority of which have original terms averaging eleven months 
the remaining  weighted average term to maturity for the company s certificate accounts approximated six months at december  generally  the company s offering rates for certificate accounts move directionally with the general level of short term interest rates  though the margin may vary due to competitive pressures 
while the maturities of interest bearing deposits in the following gap table imply that declines in interest rates will result in further declines in interest rates paid on deposits  interest rates cannot drop below  and there is a behavioral limit somewhere above as to how low the rates can be reduced before the company s customers no longer will maintain the deposit with the company 
in addition to the certificates of deposits  the company has million in interest bearing transaction accounts savings  money markets and interest bearing checking as of december   with rates being paid between and 
although the following table would indicate that declines in interest rates would result in a corresponding decline in the cost of deposits  interest rates cannot drop below  and there is a behavioral limit somewhere above as to how low the rates can be reduced before the company s customers no longer will maintain the deposit with the company 
the following table sets forth information concerning repricing opportunities for the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  the amount of assets and liabilities shown 
table of contents within a particular period were determined in accordance with their contractual maturities  except that adjustable rate products are included in the period in which they are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature 
such assets and liabilities are classified by the earlier of their maturity or repricing date

in december  the company entered into an interest rate swap transaction with an unaffiliated party 
the terms of the swap are identical to the terms of the trust preferred securities outstanding with regards to maturity  payment dates  prepayment penalties and other terms 
the swap agreement calls for the company to receive fixed rate payments of on a semiannual basis for a notional principal amount of million 
per the terms of the agreement  the company pays a rate of six month libor plus  adjusted semiannually 
the six month libor rate as of february  was 
static gap analysis has certain limitations 
measuring the volume of repricing or maturing assets and liabilities does not always measure the full impact on net interest income 
static gap analysis does not account for rate caps on products  dynamic changes such as increasing prepay speeds as interest rates decrease  basis risk  or the benefit of non rate funding sources 
the relation between product rate repricing and market rate changes basis risk is not the same for all products 
the majority of the company s loan portfolio reprices quickly and completely following changes in market rates  while non term deposit rates in general move more slowly and 
table of contents usually incorporate only a fraction of the change in rates 
products categorized as non rate sensitive  such as non interest bearing demand deposits  in the static gap analysis behave like long term fixed rate funding sources 
both of these factors tend to make the company s behavior more asset sensitive than is indicated in the static gap analysis 
management expects to experience higher net interest income when rates rise  the opposite of what is indicated by the static gap analysis 
the following table shows the effects of changes in projected net interest income for under the interest rate shock scenarios stated 
the table was prepared as of december   at which time prime was 
changes in rates projected net interest income change from base case change from base case dollars in thousands bp bp bp bp bp bp bp assumptions are inherently uncertain  and  consequently  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategy 
contractual obligations and commitments at december   the company had commitments to extend credit of approximately million and obligations under letters of credit of million  all of which expire within one year 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers  provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
commitments are generally variable rate  and many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon 
as such  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company uses the same credit underwriting policies in granting or accepting such commitments or contingent obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments  which consist of evaluating customers creditworthiness individually 
standby letters of credit written are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the financial performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support private borrowing arrangements 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
when deemed necessary  the company holds appropriate collateral supporting those commitments 
management does not anticipate any material losses as a result of these transactions 

table of contents as of december  aggregate minimum rental commitments for certain real property under non cancelable operating leases having an initial or remaining term of more than one year are as follows gross rental commitments sub lease income net rental commitments dollars in thousands thereafter total liquidity liquidity management involves the company s ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily operations  which include funding of securities purchases  providing for customers credit needs and ongoing repayment of borrowings 
the company s liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by the asset liability committee and the board of directors 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet the needs of the company  including adequate cash flow for off balance sheet instruments 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and broker deposits  federal funds facilities  repurchase agreement facilities and advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco 
these funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans  the routine liquidation of securities from the trading securities portfolio and sales and participation of eligible loans 
primary uses of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits  originations and purchases of loans  purchases of investment securities  and payment of operating expenses 
the company experienced net cash inflows of million during the year ended december  and net cash outflows of million during the year ended december  from operating activities 
net cash inflows from operating activities during were primarily from net income of the company  accompanied by the net proceeds from the sale of loans held for sale which were greater than the origination of loans held for sale 
during the net cash outflows were the result of the net proceeds from the origination of loans held for sale  which were greater than the proceeds from the sale of loans held for sale and partially offset by the net income for the year 
net cash outflows from investing activities totaled million and million during and  respectively 
net cash outflows from investing activities for both periods can be attributed primarily to the growth in the bank s loan portfolio in excess of proceeds from principal repayments on loans held for investment and purchases of trading and held to maturity investment securities 
these activities were partially offset by net proceeds from the maturities of investment securities held to maturity and sale of trading securities 
the company experienced net cash inflows from financing activities of million during and million during  primarily due to the growth in deposits and advances from the fhlb 
in addition  during  the company completed a private placement of common stock with net proceeds of million

at december   the company s available borrowing capacity includes approximately million in federal funds line facilities  and million in unused fhlb advances 
management believes its liquidity sources to be stable and adequate 
at december   management was not aware of any information that was reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s liquidity position

the strategic plan calls for continuing increases in assets and liabilities  and the capital required may therefore be in excess of retained earnings 
the ability to obtain capital is dependent upon the capital markets as well as performance of the company 
management regularly evaluates sources of capital and the timing required to meet its strategic objectives 
critical accounting policies and estimates the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures found elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments the affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of the servicing assets and interest only strips and the valuation of other repossessed assets 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for loan losses 
an allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to adequately provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and other extensions of credit  including off balance sheet credit extensions 
the allowance is based upon a continuing review of the portfolio  past loan loss experience and current economic conditions  which may affect the borrowers ability to pay  guarantees by government agencies and the underlying collateral value of the loans 
loans which are deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and deducted from the allowance 
changes in these factors and conditions may cause management s estimate of the allowance to increase or decrease and result in adjustments to the company s provision for loan losses 
in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  the board loan committee initially identifies all classified  restructured or non performing loans and assesses each loan for impairment  as well as any government guarantees on these loans  which in general do not require an allowance for loan loss 
loans are considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
the company measures an impaired loan by using the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent and the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate if the loan is not collateral dependent 
after the specific allowances for loans are allocated  the remaining loans are pooled based on collateral type 
a range of potential losses is determined using an eight quarter historical analysis by pool based on the relative carrying value at the time of charge off 
in addition  the board loan committee establishes reserve levels for each pool based upon loan type as well as market condition for the underlying collateral  considering such factors as trends in the real estate market  economic uncertainties and other risks  where it is probable that losses could be incurred in future periods 
in general there are no reserves established for the government guaranteed portion of loans outstanding 
all non specific reserves are allocated to each of these pools 

table of contents the reserve for losses on commitments to extend credit are determined based on the historical losses on the underlying collateral of the commitment 
the majority of these commitments are on construction loans 
the board loan committee also establishes a reserve for each pool based upon loan type as well as market conditions for the underlying real estate or other collateral  considering such factors as trends in the real estate market  economic uncertainties and other risks  where it is probable that losses could be incurred in future periods 
in general there are no reserves established for the government guaranteed portion of commitments to extend credit 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
servicing assets and interest only strips 
servicing assets are recognized when loans are sold with servicing retained 
servicing assets are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated future net servicing income 
the fair value of servicing assets is estimated by discounting the future cash flows at estimated future current market rates for the expected life of the loans 
the company uses industry prepayment statistics in estimating the expected life of the loan 
management periodically evaluates servicing assets for impairment 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the rights are stratified based on original term to maturity 
the amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the servicing asset for a stratum exceeds its fair value 
in estimating fair values at december   the company utilized a weighted average prepayment assumption of approximately and a discount rate of 
in estimating fair values at december   the company utilized a weighted average prepayment assumption of approximately and a discount rate of rights to future interest income from serviced loans that exceeds contractually specified servicing fees are classified as interest only strips 
the interest only strips are accounted for as trading securities and recorded at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses recorded in earnings in the period of change of fair value 
unrealized gains or losses on interest only strips were not material during the years ended december   and at december  and  the fair value of interest only strips was estimated using a weighted average prepayment assumption of approximately and  respectively  and a discount rate of changes in these assumptions and economic factors may result in increases or decreases in the valuation of our servicing assets and interest only strips 
real estate owned and other repossessed assets 
real estate or other assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are initially recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell through a charge to the allowance for estimated loan losses 
subsequent declines in value are charged to operations 
at december   the repossessed asset is an aircraft 
valuation of the aircraft was done using the collateral method based on a recent appraisal of the underlying collateral 
there were no specific reserves on this asset as of december  there were no real estate or other assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure or other repossessed assets as of december  for further information on these and other significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report
